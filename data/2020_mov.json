It's hitting me harder the more I think about it.

Yes, you can get restitution or justice but you never come out on top. Every fantasy of revenge doesn\u2019t amount to what was taken from you and it leaves you feeling hollow. It\u2019s sad and you may win a little but there\u2019s always a cost and they have always taken something that you\u2019ll never get back- your peace of mind, trust, normalcy, etc. It\u2019s a very true look into the dichotomy of rape culture albeit with a cinematic flair for Hollywood. \n\nI enjoyed this movie and it made me uncomfortable as a sexual assault survivor, but it also made me process my grief in a way I never have. I would love to enact revenge on the people who hurt me but the whole movie is a lesson in catharsis and how it\u2019s about moving on and living, not being stuck in amber. Cassandra was stuck and obsessed and it held her back and it made me realize I\u2019m holding myself back out of fear and longing for the past. \n\nI\u2019d give this a solid 8/10 and I\u2019ll definitely be rewatching it in the future. Emerald and Carrey did an amazing job and I look forward to seeing more.\n\nEdit: Since some people are disgusting, let me make it clear- I have no sympathy for rapists, and they do not deserve to move on. They should have to live with the shame of what they did to another human every single goddamn day. VICTIMS should be able to move on and be free. Perpetrators of sexual assault KNOW BETTER and should have to live with their choices while victims should be advocated for and help move past their trauma. \n\nEdit2: Abandoning this account because I can't believe a movie review for a film I liked and helped me process my trauma got turned into a rape apologist debate. However, once again FUCK  u/foreveryoungaginte the rape apologist and stan promising young woman.", "Really enjoyed this movie. I've been seeing trailers for it since probably early this year and it seemed like it would have to walk a fine line and I really think it did. This movie was such a great mix of darkness and comedy while being wildly relevant and even kind of cute. For a first time director who also wrote it I think it's fair to say I'm blown away. \n\nThis movie is, above all else, dark. Things are implied that may be the darkest things in film this year and even though some of them are taken back you still have time in this movie where you don't know how far she's taken it and it's frightening. Carey Mulligan is really amazing here. She is playing the part perfectly to the point where I don't know whether or not to trust her character, not sure if I should root for her or look away. In the end she walks the tight rope of accomplishing her goals without really hurting anyone but herself, but the ride there is absolutely wild. \n\nIt would have been so easy to make this movie about how terrible all men are but it's really a lot more than that, there's a lot of nuance. The ultimate reveal that Burnham was at that party feels like the nail in the coffin as far as how this movie feels about the idea of \"not all men\" but she goes after women too. Her vengeance wasn't necessarily just about gender, it was about who hurt her friend whether it be another friend who ignored her or the woman administrator that didn't believe her or the lawyer who bullier her. \n\nThe lawyer scene was actually so good, the way she had no idea what to even do with a man who actually felt remorse, the way she ended up trusting him most of all with the evidence after she died. This movie really does a great job of taking no prisoners but also not looking at the incident in one way. It wasn't just a group of men, it was the system around them that enabled them to not see and therefore not understand the consequences of their actions. \n\nMan, I dunno, I had heard this movie was good but I was just so impressed by the style and all of the performances. Even the small roles like the parents or her bar victims were great, no one came off as mustache twirling evil or psychotic, except maybe our protagonist. And it was insane to see her die, but it also made sense. It was almost like she had moved on and learned to be happy with Burnham, but then she was faced with the opportunity to look her friend's rapists in the eye. Almost like she chose truth over ignorance and signed her own death warrant as she did it. \n\nI think this is an easy 8 or 9/10. The issues talked about in this movie are both very complex and very simple and I was really amazed by how well the movie conveyed both of those ideas while still being really funny and as dark a movie as I have seen in a long time.", "This movie was initially enjoyable as a viewer, but ultimately difficult to process as someone who has often fantasized about seeking revenge against those who have wronged me. The film really demonstrates the emotional, physical, and psychological toll that the pursuit of revenge can take on a person. In the end, the main character does achieve her goal of sending the rapist to prison (and on his wedding day no less), but at the cost of her own life. The ending should have been gratifying, but instead it left me feeling hollow, which I assume was the writers intention. I still wanted \u201cthe bad guy\u201d to lose, but more than that, I also wanted \u201cthe good guy\u201d to win (the good guy being the protagonist, Cassie.) The movie shows that unfortunately both men and women can be inherently \u201cbad,\u201d but few are capable of real change and redemption. At the same time, others may come across as \u201cnice,\u201d when in reality they are not as kind as they appear, while a rare, select few are truly \u201cgood.\u201d Regardless, no one and nothing is worth putting before your own life and sanity. To me, this was not just a film about sexual assault, but also about the consequences of suffering from mental health issues.", "Hoooly fuck.\n\nI went into this movie having accidentally heard something about a suicide and a murder. So I assumed she murders a rapist and another one that gets caught kills himself. Nope.\n\nSaddest thing when the bedroom scene happened, I was legitimately floored. Stopped watching for a moment to pull up the Wikipedia page and spoil that line of plot because I could not believe it. It actually feels like someone you know in real life died. That\u2019s rare. Could not watch that part, seeing her under the pillow. I felt so hopeless when she died and it seemed as if it was for nothing, with Al and the other guy trying to cover it up and reduce fault. Just pure dread as life seemingly goes on the exact way it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nI really wish she got to see the plan through.\n\nGod, this movie is going to stick with me for ages. 10/10. Neat idea breaking the wall and having the casting be a factor in the subject. I saw \u2018Ryan being in the video\u2019 a mile away but didn\u2019t ruin much. \n\nSome pretty strong dialogue in there too with Cassie asking the one guy if he\u2019s ever scored in daylight, same with her reminding the Dean how differently you frame things when it\u2019s about someone you love.\n\nReally liked the attention to detail too - when they were first mentioning Al Monroe, I went back to see if he was on the list.

It provides Cassie with clear motive to kill Al, and her note detailing where she would be ie the bachelor party implied she expected a confrontation with him and thus I think a lawyer would be able to present a case of self defence for Al (not that I think it was in self defence, but it would be enough to raise doubt), and while he and Joe might still face obstruction charges for burning the body and not coming forward, my experience with the legal system doesn't fill me with confidence Cassie herself will get any real justice.", "Went in with no real expectations and just watched the trailer thinking \u201cthis looks good.\u201d\n\nWent out thinking this is hands down the best movie I\u2019ve seen in 2020, and maybe the best I\u2019ve seen in several years. \n\nI cannot wait for more of my close friends to watch it so we can talk about it.\n\nAbsolutely incredible movie.", "I loved this movie and I\u2019m enjoying reading all the criticism.

Maybe not in a way I really wanted it to, but it did. Even after I saw it I wished there had been explicit trigger warnings for survivors. It was already a step above most \u2018vigilante revenge\u2019 movies throughout. Then that ending twist really left me feeling shocked, hurt, and in pain. \n\nYou just really put in perspective all of the times you wanted to hurt the person who did what they did. The crazy stunts you imagined, the sick method of retribution. Then you just realize how empty it is. How they tried to make you into a shell, a vessel that could contain their sexual urges. Ignored your promise, your worth. Then what happens after they go to prison? Or you torch out their house? Nothing. The world keeps moving, and no one knows what they lost. \n\nI personally wonder if it was a loss. Should Cassie have become a doctor? Gone back and helped to fix the culture from within? Or is revenge worth it? Is it worth it to sink down and show your predator your dark side in turn. I honestly don\u2019t like thinking about these questions.", "Overall very good movie.  There were a few moments where it seemed a little ridiculous for Cassie to keep \"getting away with it.\" \n\nLike the dude in the truck.  Who the fuck would just sit there as opposed to calling the cops?  And the dudes at the end who burned her body? Come on.  \"Uh, yes officer.  Last night a woman pretended to be a stripper in order to gain access to my party, drugged all of my friends, and lied about her identity in order to get me secluded, at which point she handcuffed me to my bed and attempted to murder me.\" Boom.  Scott free.  Roll credits.  \n\nLike it felt like the director originally had the movie just end there, but then realized \"shit that's straight up self defense, better have them act like the biggest fucking morons so they can get arrested at the end.\"\n\nAgain, overall solid movie, and I'm thrilled to see what else Emerald has in store.  Some of the ideas here just felt a little half baked.", "Fuuuuuckiiiing HELL. Saw this last night, what a shot in the arm it was. I knew nothing about the film other than Carey Mulligan is in it and it has hype and after that opening scene with Adam Brody, I was gripped and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m out of it even still.\n\nI appreciate the way the film managed to present conversations on sexual assault/consent without being too ham fisted. It felt natural to me, while all the time giving you stuff to think about after the film ended. Yes, there were some flaws, it\u2019s not a perfect film but the pros of it far outweigh any cons, and I haven\u2019t felt this hyped after seeing a film since when I first saw Parasite.\n\nSurely a lock for best screenplay, I can\u2019t think of much competition for Carey Mulligan for actress (maybe Viola Davis in MRBB? I didn\u2019t really like Nomadland, but I\u2019m sure Frances McDormand will be nominated). I want everyone I know to see this film so I can talk about it with people.

Bravo!", "My god what a fucking movie.", "One of the best movies of 2020,I thought I am gonna dislike the ending because someone spoiled it for me but, I found it pretty satisfying. I think in the end Cassie's death is the only way she can achieved her peace. I think someone mentioned that the theme is about survivor's guilt. Cassie felt guilty throughout her life because she couldn't fix about what happened to Nina, so I think even though she revenged Al and lived, I think she would not achieved her peace and feel fullfilled. So I think, she only see death as the only way for her to be fulfilled.\n\nP.S. I really enjoyed when Cassie & Ryan danced to Stars Are Blind, [here is the story behind it.](https://ew.com/movies/promising-young-woman-stars-are-blind-paris-hilton-scene/)", "I never thought I'd hate Bo Burnham", "I liked how the movie really fucked with our perception of Cassie. For most of the movie, I 100% believed she paid that guy to take advantage of Madison (Allison Brie). It makes you sit with that thought for a long time, and still root for a character who may have done something just as awful as Al and his friends. When it's finally cleared up that nothing happened, it's a bit of a sigh of relief that Cassie didn't do something so horrible, but she still made Madison believe it happened, and probably would never have told her the truth if she hadn't come to Cassie's house. \n\nI also thought about the long, awful scene showing Cassie dying. The entire movie shies away from showing any assault. The guys Cassie goes home with always stop before it goes too far, we never see what happens with Madison, and we only hear what happens in the video of Nina. But when we get to Cassie being suffocated, we get the entire process, front and center, and it really shakes you as a viewer. It's clear that Cassie didn't fully expect or necessarily even want to die (even though she had those whole texting and mailing thing planned), which makes it more realistic unfortunately. Cassie easily walking in, drugging and hurting those guys and getting away scot free was an ending fit for a campy revenge thriller, but I'm glad the movie stuck with something darker and more realistic.\n\nAnother thing, I've been thinking about the scene with Cassie and Nina's mom. Nina's mom seems much more happier and at peace than where Cassie is, so it shows that recovery and acceptance is possible, it's just a path that Cassie refused to take. I would've liked a little more focus on, or Nina's mom pointing out that Cassie wasn't the one assaulted. Nina was, but Cassie was putting this title of hard done by avenger on herself. \n\nI don't know how I feel about Cassie achieving success and revenge in death. As I said, her ruining the lives of everyone and sitting back satisfied and at peace wouldn't of worked either, but it's still a very depressing conclusion that shows there's no happy endings in stories of sexual assault.", "Word is this movie starts streaming 17 days from now, January 11th. I was pissed it was doing a theatrical run when nobody is going to see it but it hits streaming soon so not bad.", "I really, really dug it, but I don\u2019t know about that ending. I admire it\u2019s commitment to realism, and the boldness to make that call, but it\u2019s such a big twist from the tone set up to that point (and almost more importantly, the film that was marketed) that for me it really sours the whole thing\n\nEdit: my username is pretty suspicious considering the subject matter, and I very much regret it in this moment", "I feel Cassie planned to die in the end segment. She wanted Al to be arrested for murder", "Very bleak and realistic that it took a murder charge for the rapist to get arrested.", "What a great movie. I love revenge flicks but little did I know I\u2019d be bawling by the end of it.", "Between this and kid detective, Brody has been on a hot roll, hope he makes a come back!", "Wow that was pretty damn good.\n\nOne thing that dampers it is that Al Monroe can plead self-defense and win in court.", "I really loved this film for its direction and storyline but also just for how it made me think. I texted a good number of my friends to have them see it as I waited in the restroom for my friend right after the film - and am willing to take anyone to see it myself. It had me really analyzing the idea of good people and good guys, and my experiences in life. Had me on the edge of my seat at times. Made me laugh a lot, cry, gasp. A really enjoyable experience as an audience member and a really moving experience as a woman. \n\nMy main hitches about the movie are mostly performance based. With a lot of the \u2018antagonists\u2019 like the men from the bar, Al, Joe, etc I felt their performances dripped too much with irony or like they were super?? idk tounge in cheek? Alison Brie and Bo Burnam did the authenticity best, I think, but even with some lines it felt so obvious that these actors don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re saying. It makes sense, it\u2019s not how they feel, but it still really felt like it took away from this central idea about how normal this behavior is taken in. This movie is funny, these actors are funny, but I think Bo did the best between balancing humor and reality, and not letting it take away from his character as much as the others.", "Holy fuck was that good", "I loved it. I see a lot of people saying that it was heavy handed in the \"Oh she protrayed the guys as really bad guys\". but as a 28yo cis male, she didn't. There are so many bad guys out there, and nearly every girl I've ever talked to, dated, anything, has some disgusting sexual assualt story that they brush off because \"oh he wasn't a bad guy\". I thought she wrote/directed them perfectly. I went into this movie, after hearing nothing about it and watching the trailer, thinking she was going to be killing these guys and it would've been a horror movie. I was so pleasantly surprised by it. I don't know how to spoiler things oh wait I see the button. >!I literally fucking screamed and fucking nauseous when he held that pillow over her head, and kept wanting her foot to move when joe walked in and she would some how miraculously kill both of them or anything other than her dying. !<Either way the emotional roller coaster at the end of this movie and the curiosity throughout about nina was such a fun ride, I can't remember the last time I felt this way after a movie.

After all, we were robbed of that in [Ms 45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvCg0mRePOM).\n\nEmerald did an incredible job - and the scene with the Dean of the Medical School was sooo perfectly crafted and written.\n\nOne of the greatest hurdles to exposing male violence is unravelling the mindset of women who constantly enable it. Emerald illustrated that conundrum perfectly. A first within a feature film narrative. The actress playing The Dean  - wow - how much fun was it to watch her from being smug to terrified. Yassss. Nailed it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ending basically confirms male depravity. How a woman, no matter how \"pink pilled\" ( conscious of the patriarchal matrix she lives in)  she is, no matter how smart and brave she is - will always be defeated by the banality of male nature.\n\nThis is why the ending was so chilling. It echoed real life. Male nature is unwavering. Unchanging. They are predatory, entitled and opportunistic.\n\nCassie went to the party knowing she could potentially die. This was her bravery. It happened way sooner than she expected, however.\n\nIt broke my heart as a viewer to know that she died. She was the greatest darn cinematic heroine I had witnessed in my lifetime. Thanks Emerald for creating her.\n\nAlso - if you are reading this Emerald - I can't wait to see more of your work. Both as an actor/director/writer. I love you. You have a lifelong fan with me.

I couldn\u2019t wait to watch this movie and now that I have- I feel like it\u2019s been buried under my skin. Left me veryyy uncomfortable and veryyy sad for that ending. That ending boy! I kinda had an idea that that was where it was heading \u2018cause of the trailers showing those dogs sniffing the dirt/ground. But it still knocked me on my ass when they showed that very uncomfortably longgg scene. Made me wince and close my eyes I was so uncomfortable. But I think it did its job. It was effective and though I would have wanted the \u201calternative/original\u201d end that Fennell wrote- I am glad she went with the final ending we see now. So now I feel like I have a bad after taste in my mouth after watching this movie but I think it was meant to give that effect to the viewers. They would have copped out if they went with the typical Hollywood happy ending of Cassie getting her revenge of tattooing Nina\u2019s name on Al\u2019s chest and cutting his d*ck off and her leaving the cabin smoking a cigarette but it\u2019s not real life. Just look at the Brock Turner case and Brett Cavanaugh who now sits as a Supreme Court Justice judge and those are the examples of why this movie went there with its ending.

But this left the nastiest taste in my mouth, and i'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.", "I loved it. It is sad that number of movies that are able to describe raw emotions of a common assault is rare. Songs were so befitting. The fact that Cassie was so mature about her emotions although it is clear that she did not get over them is getting more and more admirable when I think about it. Cause that is what happens when you uncover something new about a trauma, you do not react as fast as a viewer would. You truly think about it and when you decide that it is too much for you to let it go, you start to create your plan whether it is revenge or getting help. \n\nBut... Uggghhhh... >!Did she really had to die?! Okay maybe that is to serve to purpose of achieving more realistic movie, I get it. I cannot both appreciate that the movie is realistic and want an optimistic end.!<\n\nOne of my main issues that Cassie and Nina were both soo beautiful and soo smart. It is not more tragic when this horrendous thing happens to the most beautiful one or the smartest one. Predators like these guys, they do not usually go for the prettiest ones or the smartest ones, they go for the \"average\" ones so that they are more under the radar.

I thought she look about as slutty hot as a club crawler could get when she was doing her thing. Don't think the part called for a super model that couldn't act. Ending was the entire movie ( kind of like SEVEN). Without that ending it would have just been another okay revenge flick.

That's a plan to get killed if the man reacts badly.\n\nIt's stupid to kidnap a child and I thought the whole conversation with the dean was stupid. Obviously the dean would have just called the police and gotten her arrested for kidnapping a minor or threatening to kidnap a minor. She wouldn't have gotten this cool gotcha moment.\n\nIt's stupid to pay a man to bring her drunk ex-friend to a hotel room. First of all, what were the chances that her ex-friend would drink to the point of getting drunk? That's a silly plot contrivance. Second of all, she had no guarantee that the man she paid wouldn't rape her ex-friend while she was passed out, so she actually put a woman in danger of being raped.\n\nIt's stupid to try to go do anything at the bachelor party when she already has the video and she could just use the video to get the rapist convicted and shame everyone involved.\n\nEven the script is stupid because one moment she's able to find out where the dean's daughter goes to school and what she looks like and what band she likes and where she'll be, but then she needs to blackmail someone to get the location of the bachelor party.\n\nThe only thing that I thought was realistic was that she got killed at the end. She played with fire trying to enact a stupid revenge by being alone in a room with dangerous men stronger than her and alienating them on purpose.

No swords or shields because it's too \"violent\" even though the Amazons are a warrior race and is all Diana wanted to be? Yeah, the signs were clear. The bare minimum a movie has to do is to establish what is possible and what isn't and stay consistent with those. The opposite of \"dark\" isn't throwing all logic out the gate and just winging it.

The first WW was a huge success by every metric - critics and audience ratings as well as its BO performance. It made Patty and Gal into Hollywood powerhouses overnight.

It didn't seem to have any real message other than to not cheat and to not take the short path but that message is never put in action later in the film... It's not like the gold armour she had couldn't be used if she wasn't ready. She just had the damn thing in her house for crying out loud. Definitely seems like it was a sequence that was made for the first film not this one.\n\n* When she apprehends those thieves in the Mall she decides to completely total a Police Car for no reason...\n\n* They completely glance over the ethical ramifications of her dead boyfriend possessing the body of some random dude... Some could argue she basically raped the dude... At the very least put some innocent dude in harm's way during the events of the film. I really can't see a single reason they couldn't just make him appear in his own body. It's not like the wish can't manifest physical objects which we saw with the Nukes. Maybe if it turned out at the end of the film that they would become a couple I could see some sort of link but they decide to shoot that down rather than just never bringing the dude back up again...\n\n* So Diana can now just whenever she wants make anything invisible... Is this in the Comics?\n\n* So Pascal just walks into the White House and conveniently they have a literal drawing of the device he needs to complete his evil plan... Talk about plot convenience...\n\n* Pedro Pascal performance was decent but the character was really badly written. Never believed he gave a fuck about his kid who just seemed to pop up whenever it was convenient. \n\n* Another Hollywood, beautiful woman made ugly turns out to be beautiful trope! It's Ready Player One all over again...\n\n* Pilot from WWI who only piloted propeller planes suddenly has complete understanding of how a jet made 40 years later works and handles...\n\n* What exactly was the negative effect that Cheetah Woman had from her wish? I originally thought it was her turning into a Cheetah but that was done by Pascal when he did his broadcast. Was it just that she would turn evil/lose her self? \n\n* They hype up this amazing armour that the greatest Amazon wore yet it gets torn like paper minutes into the fight... Though I guess I shouldn't expect much from the same civilisation that use wooden bow and arrows against technologically advanced species that have flying space ship during the war against Darkside.\n\n* Diana can suddenly fly by ACT 3 yet for absolutely no reason other than to make a cool shot and use it in the trailer she decided to lasso a lighting strike... Also why can she not fly in BvsS or Justice League?\n\n* The flying scene decided to use one of the most cliche soundtracks you can put in a movie. Talk about lazy and unoriginal.\n\n* That truck fight sequences was so poorly executed, some of the shots were the most obvious green screen last second shots shots I've seen in a film in years. Also the kids randomly playing on the road seems really odd. These kids are probably playing on that road all the time, they're fully aware to get out of the way when cars that you can see from miles away are inbound...\n\n* Why didn't Diana just kill Pascal? They say it themselves they just need to destroy the stone or rescind their wish, I guess she was really banking on that whole \"humans are all good without Hades\" thing. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that due to Pascal imbuing the stones power it might not work. Though if that was the case if he dies does it mean there's no way to stop the whole thing?\n\n* They show that wishes can kill people so why didn't Pascal get someone to wish for that annoying woman with the Lasso who keeps trying kill him just conveniently dies? It's not like she's too powerful for the stone to work on her as we saw it take her powers away.\n\n* The message at the end of the film has got to be one of the most ironic ones I have seen in a film.

Joe is not a Black man who teaches. He\u2019s a teacher who happens to be Black. (or light blue without his body)\n\nThe film doesn\u2019t try to erase race. Joe\u2019s dad specifically mentions jazz is one of the African American community\u2018s contributions to culture. The barbershop scene is culturally coded.\n\nI was watching with my kids (we\u2019re white) and partway through had the thought, \u201cIn 40 years I\u2019ve never seen a family friendly movie with so many Black leading characters and not one of them acting the fool.\u201d (Looking at you, Tyler Perry.)\n\nI understand that digging into the ugliness of racial/cultural issues is valuable in art, but I\u2019m also glad my kids could see Black characters just being good at doing what they like: saxophone, teaching, cutting hair.

I was on the edge of my seat, expecting something to go wrong, for him to blank under the pressure or something. But when the concert goes fantastically, afterwards we see that the problem was that it DID meet expectations: it was awesome. So then the problem is \"now what?\" Or \"was that it?\". In the end we realize the message - that living in the moment and letting go of great expectations of destiny is the way to see the true beauty of life. All accompanied by that sweet sweet JAZZ.

(She gives him a wry smile, as if she knows that every night is a grind)\n\nThat shit got me good. Joe realizes that his life has already started a long time ago. Reaching his dream wasn't the beginning of it. \n\nThere was no magic pill that was ever going to make him feel fulfilled.\n\nThe only way out was to embrace the life that was already around him. \n\nAs an artist, I felt that hard. Always imagining that there would be a 'day' when I would be famous. \n\nUntil realizing that there would be no 'day.' The grind never stops. Life doesnt stop just because you 'made it.'\n\nAnd Joe had to reckon with the notion of, \"what now?\"", "Thought the movie was fantastic \u2014 maybe in my top 3 Pixar movies ever. Simple underlying premise done beautifully.\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen some critiques though I just don\u2019t agree with. My thoughts:\n\n1.\tJoe should have stayed dead: This one doesn\u2019t make any sense for two reasons. One, that\u2019s super dark for what is essentially still a kids movie. Two, joe finding inner peace isn\u2019t the point of the movie \u2014 it\u2019s a byproduct. The central theme of Soul is finding purpose not in singular passions, but in simply experiencing the world around yourself and living. Joe returning back to earth at the end makes that point, with what the movie framed as the the limitless human potential for experience. In my opinion, that is a much more poignant and beautiful ending \u2014 not to mention thematically consistent. Joe staying dead would have felt out of place in a movie all about the beauty of life.\n\n2.\tThe movie ended abruptly: yes it did, and I love it. What joe does next isn\u2019t for the audience to see, because joe doesn\u2019t even know what he\u2019ll do next \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter. He can do anything, and he might do everything. What he does next is for the audience to imagine. There\u2019s no neat-bow resolution, and I think that\u2019s beautiful. Again, thematically consistent. \n\n3.\tJoe should have stayed a Mentor or gone back to teaching, as that was his true purpose: I thought the movie would go this direction and I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t. As the higher dimensional beings explain, there is no singular purpose of life for anyone \u2014 that\u2019s not what living is about. If Soul would have framed teaching or mentoring as Joe\u2019s true singular purpose, the message of the movie would have been neutered a bit. I like to think Joe kept teaching, did his night gigs, and overall learned to appreciate life itself more. But life is about having all sorts of purposes to varying degrees, and I think the movie makes that point with precision. \n\nAlso, the Knicks dig was great.", "I noticed the camera ever so slightly and gently moving in some scenes, giving the film a much more natural feel; like someone is holding a camera. It occurred to me during the barbershop scene, and now I'm having a crisis trying to think if this is new for animation or if they've done this before and I've only just realised!", "The trying to hail a taxi as a black man in NYC is gonna be one of the most adult jokes Pixar has ever done.", "I went into this movie fully expecting to end up bawling. And while I did cry a bit (when 22 as Joe gave his speech to his mom about if I die today will my life have been worth living?), I honestly have never felt so optimistic finishing a movie. As a single guy in his late 20s still doing his best living through a pandemic and trying to be happy while I see everyone\u2019s achievements of marriages and kids and trying to pursue your one passion, a movie who\u2019s message was \u201cit\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t know what your passion is. Live your life, even the simple things can give you purpose.\u201d Really hit hard.

The curiosity & urge to know why it sounded so familiar was killing me. But after further examining of the tracks titled \u2018Terry Time\u2019 & \u2018Terry Time Too\u2019 on the Soul soundtrack, it clicked... \n Considering the soundtrack was in part produced by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails for the more electronic/ambient tracks of the film, I presumed the \u2018Terry Time\u2019 sequences had to have originated or been inspired by a song from their own catalog... but which song?? \n So I jumped over to NIN on Spotify & played their top hit \u2018Closer\u2019. This immediately solidified my theory. \u2018Terry Time\u2019 at its core has the same ascending melody line as \u2018Closer\u2019, specifically the ascending synth line starting around 1:26 of \u2018Closer\u2019. Playing the two tracks back to back, it\u2019s almost undeniable. Both are even in the same key. \u2018Terry Time\u2019 is obviously more toned down, muted & minimal tonally in nature comparatively to \u2018Closer\u2019. But this, in my opinion, is a blatant homage to \u2018Closer\u2019, the ol\u2019 tip of the hat from Trent & Atticus to their own hit from the 90\u2019s. Although this seems pretty glaring & obvious to me, I\u2019ve combed thru the web & can\u2019t seem to find anyone talking bout it. Anyone else here notice the similarities?

Acknowledging this effort, Peter Docter stated that \"There's a long and painful history of caricatured racist design tropes that were used to mock African-Americans.\" According to Kemp Powers, the animators used lighting as a way to highlight the ethnic diversity in the living world. Pixar sought to capture the fine details of these black characters, including the textures of black hair and the way light plays on various tones of black skin. Cinematographer Bradford Young worked as a lighting consultant on the film*", "It was a good movie, although the ending did feel like it was missing something. It almost feels like a short film, and not like a full-on Disney/Pixar movie. For the ending,  I don't like that he gets a second chance at life.

In cubism artists try to step beyond the theory of forms to represent a subject from as many viewpoints as possible. \n\nThe being we cannot comprehend is smashed into a form that is every possible view of the form itself.

She didn't understand the basic plot points of the movie ([https://www.insider.com/pixar-soul-movie-review-2020-12](https://www.insider.com/pixar-soul-movie-review-2020-12)) and went on berating the movie.\n\nHonestly, her review was so rubbish, and I couldn't help but wonder how did such a rubbish review find a place on INSIDER?\n\n***1. a bratty \"unborn\" soul (Tina Fey) who has the ability to go to Earth, but doesn't want to take the trip because she can't see the point in living.***\n\n22 didn't have the ability to go to Earth because she was unable to find her spark, hence she didn't have an Earth pass and couldn't pass it to Joe. And what Joe did was to help 22 find her spark, so 22 could have an Earth pass, and then the \"ability\" to go to Earth.\n\n***2. In its final moments, \"Soul\" is set to sacrifice its Black lead so a white woman can go and live out her life on Earth. Joe decides he's fine with dying because he was able to live out a dream.***\n\nIt was never stated in any way that 22 is a white woman; the author inferred that because 22 is voiced by Tina Fey, a white woman. 22 only ever appeared in the form of a soul, and later in Joe's body; there was no suggestion that 22 was White or a woman. The author inferred that because she knew 22 was voiced by a white female in real life.\n\nI disagree that Joe decided he's fine with dying because he lived out a dream. I think it's the opposite: the Earth pass belonged to 22, it was 22's pass! Joe took it from 22. Joe decided to do the right thing, to give it back to its rightful owner and let 22 experience a life on Earth, instead of taking it away selfishly from 22.\n\n***3. First, Joe is killed the moment he gets his big break within the first 10 minutes of the film. What kind of message does that send to young children watching this film who see themselves in Joe?***\n\nI struggle to understand why any young child would see themselves in a quasi-struggling middle-aged school music teacher. Also, accidents happen in real life. Did the author think young children are too dumb to know that?\n\n***4. Eventually though, \"22,\" predictably, leaves Earth so Joe can continue living. It begs another question: Why does a dying Black man have to help a white woman live?***\n\nAgain, where did the author draw a conclusion that 22 is a white woman? 22 didn't leave Earth; they were caught by Terry and were sent to The Great Before.\n\n***5. I wish the film focused and channeled more of its energy into that relationship and Joe's own life rather than his bump in with \"22.***\n\nThe author misunderstood the plot. The plot is about Joe's journey leading to the epiphany. There needs to be an inciting incident, and a trigger, that propels him into a journey of getting to the epiphany. Meeting with 22 is a construct, for Joe to understand the relationships (with Joe's Mom, with Joe's barber, with Joe's students, etc.)\n\n**6.** ***Also, Pixar's first Black-led film should celebrate a Black man's experience and solely focus on his dreams and desires. Instead, Joe's life takes a backseat in order for a white woman to figure out what she wanted from life.***\n\nThe author misunderstood the movie. The movie does the exact opposite, telling you not to solely focus on dreams and desires, but enjoy the ride. Joe definitely didn't take a backseat for 22 to figure out what 22 wanted.

I loved the animation, I liked the characters a lot (although I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll necessarily be remembered as greats like Dory or Buzz Lightyear) and I thought the themes were really interesting. \n\nOverall though, I think this movie had a lot of great ideas but didn\u2019t necessarily explore them as deeply as I would\u2019ve liked. The character of 22 was also a bit thin. They established her (it?) as being extremely difficult to work with but nothing she did or said in the movie really backed that up. She seemed like a pleasant enough but somewhat insecure character, but not the impossible nightmare they tried to establish her as.", "Being a survivor on a suicide attempt.

In my top 3 animated movie ever.", "God I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am they couldn\u2019t do that Knicks joke about the Cubs anymore", "I really enjoyed the movie, it felt like Pixar's The Good Place. The sequence where Joe falls to the Great Before was incredibly cool. I don't know what piano model they used to record the music but it sounded so warm.", "I was cracking up at the close up at 22\u2019s unfinished badge. Thumbs down, rain cloud, megaphone and a donkey head in the center.", "I was listening for Daveed the entire movie and never heard him. Who was he?", "The scene inside 22 as a \u2018lost soul\u2019 has to be one of the most realistic portrayals of anxiety ever put to screen", "This one *really* fell flat for me, especially as Pixar goes.\n\nI feel like the movie absolutely refused to commit to its premise, which led to some serious pacing issues, as well as what I\u2019d call an identity crisis halfway through.\n\nWe got, what, maybe three minutes of Joe\u2019s life before he falls through the manhole? It felt like we were thrust into the Great Before almost immediately. I hardly knew Joe, hardly knew his life. Just the very bare bones. We know Pixar can do a lot with a little, but I don\u2019t think the very beginning minutes of this movie is a good example of that.\n\nSo Joe\u2019s dead, but why do I care? I barely know him from when he was alive. Plus, *nobody else* on the treadmill to the Great Beyond seems to really care? Surely Joe isn\u2019t the only one with unfinished business. It all came together to really not give me a sense of urgency or stakes about Joe\u2019s situation at all, save for Joe screaming \u201cbut my gig!\u201d at me over and over again.\n\nThen, they hardly spend any time really exploring the ins and outs of the Soul World, especially compared to, well, the obvious comparison - *Inside Out.* Inside Out really took the time to explore the world within Riley\u2019s brain, and get creative with it. I feel like *Soul,* on the other hand, just again gave us a bare bones \u201cthis is where the personalities happen, this is where they go to earth, this is the treadmill to the Great Beyond,\u201d and so on, without taking a lot of time to really explore the world. It felt so rushed to me, in fact, that before I knew it, I was suddenly watching a body swapping movie about a man and a cat. That was a *strange* leap, to me. The thread of 22 helped tie one premise to the other, but not particularly *strongly* in my opinion.\n\nThen, the ending. Is it just me, or is it *incredibly* obvious that they were driving toward one particular ending for Joe, and then just completely abandoned it at the last second with the \u201cone more chance\u201d thing. It seems to me that the original script had Joe discovering that his real spark was *teaching,* and ultimately staying \u201cdead\u201d to remain a mentor for more new souls. Everything, and I mean *everything,* pointed at this being the natural conclusion to Joe\u2019s story here. He starts off as a teacher, is immediately encouraging toward one of his students, had an enormous impact on an old student\u2019s life to the point where that student, as an adult, is reaching out to let him know about that impact on multiple occasions, the scene with the trumpet girl where he immediately understands her strengths and weaknesses, the fact that he\u2019s mentoring 22 the entire movie, the thing with the barber not becoming a veterinarian but still feeling fulfilled and like he\u2019s saving lives with what he does, the fact that being a mentor is even a plot point to begin with, the fact that 22\u2019s climactic scene is all about her relationships with past mentors, as well as her relationship with Joe, Joe seeing 22 off as she finally enters the world. It was all leading up to Joe staying dead so he can continue to impact people the best way he knows how - teaching and mentoring, despite music being another obvious passion. But then, out of nowhere, sparks don\u2019t actually mean anything concrete, it\u2019s just a nebulous \u201cwhen you\u2019re ready to live\u201d type thing, he\u2019s suddenly granted another chance at life, and it ends with him saying the most cliche \u201cI dunno what I\u2019m gonna do in life but I\u2019m gonna live every second of it\u201d line, and the credits roll? Honestly, what a letdown.\n\nAll that said, there was plenty I liked about it - the visuals were astounding, NYC in Pixar\u2019s style was great. The music was great. The sequences of Joe losing himself in his music were great. The message was good, if a bit vague and muddled. 22\u2019s insecurities hit pretty close to home and resonated well. Really liked the fast paced, Pixar style humor woven throughout the film. Jaime Foxx and Tina Fey gave excellent performances as leads, as did the rest of the supporting cast.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it enough, but frankly once the credits rolled I found myself thinking a lot more about the bad than the good, which is *not* the case with my favorite Pixar movies. I\u2019d be surprised if I ever watched it again.", "I kind of wish the film had pushed the envelope a little bit more and actually let Joe go into the Great Beyond.\n\nFantastic movie overall though, much better than the impression I got from the trailers.", "The ending was so underwhelming to me.\n\n1. The lost soul version of 22 was way out of left field. The climax feels so similar to Ralph Breaks the internet, whose 3rd act was also just a weird tone shift.\n2. There seems to be a motif of teaching throughout the movie, seeing as Joe is a teacher for band but he also mentors 22 through the Great Beyond and through life. However, nothing about this is raised in the ending. Connie is no longer in the picture. Maybe this is nit picky, but I wish there was some payoff in some way through teaching.\n3. While 22\u2019s ending is ambiguous, which is fine as the viewer can guess what happens next, Joe\u2019s ending is so abrupt. Not only does he get a cop out ending of \u201cYou can go back because you did good lmao\u201d make his choice to give the badge to 22 meaningless, but it also makes it frustrating that the film just ends 5 seconds after that. This may be wanting too much, but we never see Joe apply the lessons he learned in his life. He just goes back and credits roll immediately. Something just felt off.\n\nHowever, the rest of the film is quite good. Very engaging and interesting characters. The movie is very unique visually and music-wise. However, for a sort of spiritual successor to Inside Out, that films ending is far superior to that of this movie.", "I give Soul an 8/10. I liked it, didn\u2019t love it. Aesthetically impressive, and arguably the most mature Pixar film out there. \n\nThe biggest issue I had with the movie though, is Joe Gardner. I didn\u2019t really connect with him at all. A central message of the story is LIVING LIFE. Just because you have a talent for something, or love to do something, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you are LIVING. Living is more than that, it\u2019s moment moment, day by day, in many aspects of life. \n\nAnd Joe at the end, promises to \u201clive\u201d. The thing is, we don\u2019t ever really see him \u201cnot living\u201d.  He ends up in the hospital like 10 minutes into the movie. He gets his dream job very early on, and we don\u2019t really see him not living moment to moment. \n\nI think I would\u2019ve been able to connect with him more, if it devoted some time in the beginning, showing him actually coasting through life. He comes home and sits on the couch and watches tv until he falls asleep after playing hours of piano. A stranger outside tries to spark a conversation with him, and Gardner brushes him off. He always orders take out from the same place and never goes to different restaurants and tries different foods. \n\nJust simple things like that. I\u2019d like to have seen him being overly structured, pretty reclusive, refusing to be open to people and his environment, and only cares about playing the piano, going to his job, then playing piano some more, without making space and time for much else. I think if I saw him live life like that at first, it would\u2019ve made me feel for him more at the end. The impact of him promising to live each moment and be more alive, would\u2019ve been more profound imo. \n\nAlso..that Knicks joke. I can\u2019t remember the last time a Pixar joke made me laugh so hard. You know it\u2019s bad when a freakin Pixar movie roasts you."], "num_comments": 4829, "year": "2020"}, {"title": "Monster Hunter", "comments": ["Well, it's pretty much what you'd expect after 7ish Resident Evil movies. This movie is an action movie that is loosely tied to the videogame series Monster Hunter. For the most part it's competently made but it didn't evoke much of a reaction out of me. I wasn't scared or surprised or having fun with much that it had to offer. It was also really annoying that most the characters were speaking a different language and there were no subtitles. I think they thought it was fun that Milla and Hunter couldn't understand each other, but to me it got old real fast. They're basically the only two characters for a large chunk of the movie.\n\nI did like that her squad all get killed individually in the first half of the movie, but more on that later. I also appreciated that they kind of nailed the aesthetic of Monster Hunter. It wasn't as busy with flora and fauna as it should have been, but the airships and all the items and monsters that were supposed to look like something did, so that's nice.\n\nBut... When I've put 200 hours into Monster Hunter: World and I'm going to see a movie based on it, what I'm looking for is how does this movie pay homage to the game. And I was pretty disappointed here.\n\nRoughly half of the action scenes in this movie are Milla Jovovich vs Tony Jaa. And that's really dumb. Pretty much never in any Monster Hunter game do you fight another human, let alone hand to hand combat. It's pretty much against the entire point of the series to give two such long fight scenes to two human characters. Especially when the two fights happen so closely together, are for the same stupid reason of general mistrust, and absolved by something as simple as someone stopping and saying \"I'm not your enemy.\"\n\nFurthermore, two monsters? Really? And both were in the trailer? This was the main reason I wanted to see this tbh. The trailer looked like ass but I was like, at least Diablos looks like Diablos. I wonder what other monsters will cameo? Imagine my disappointment when like five people die in the first half of the movie... to spiders. Come on. There's like 50 monsters in MH:W base game alone. Like 15 if you want to stick to the Wildspire. I'm sure this was a budget issue but what a missed opportunity to have each soldier killed by a different monster, even if they're just there for a scene or a quick death. Having most of the cast killed by spiders in an MH movie was a joke.\n\nAnd while we're talking about monsters, I feel like the rules as to how vulnerable they are were totally out the window. I mean, the feel of the game is that yeah these things are huge and dangerous creatures, but they're not invincible. A human with daggers could kill it with some know-how and reflexes. Yet they're sitting there blasting Rathalos with a helicopter minigun and it doesn't phase it, yet when she cuts a wing with a dagger it slides through like scissors and wrapping paper. They should have left the military out of this movie because I was having a hard time believing a Barroth great sword was more effective than a tank.\n\nSure, it was cool to see chef cat in the movie and they really did nail the costumes, the look of the airship, the look of the handlers, etc. But the rest of the movie was so mundane and the plot was absolute nonsense which would all be excusable if I could just see a fucking monster that wasn't in the trailer. Ridiculous. 4/10.", "Hollywood has got to stop ending movies with blatant sequel hooks or leading in to another fight.\n\nAnyway, movie was...lifeless I think is the best word. The visual aesthetic of the world and the look of the monsters was cool. But everything else was very lackluster. Though, coming from Anderson I suppose that was to be expected.\n\nIt wasn't a complete failure. So I guess that's something.", "Got to the theater a bit late and missed the intro. I came in around the part where Tony Jaa's character was on the sand boat trying to keep the girl hunter from falling off the boat into the Diablos. What did I miss before that?\n\nOverall the visuals were quite nice and it was bit amusing to see Ron Perlman in that horrible wig and sideburns along with him doing \"action\" scenes at 70 years old. Wish we still got that Hellboy 3 with him before it was too late. Love that man. \n\nMila still looks the same pretty much for being 45 honestly. \n\nTony Jaa was very entertaining for the most part and his action scenes were still very good.\n\nAlso this time Paul W.S. Anderson didn't go crazy with cutting 10x every 5 seconds like he did with Resident Evil 6 Final Chapter.", "Four monsters. Two of them already shown in the the trailer. Hell, they basically shown all of Diablos' scenes in the trailer. The rest is focus on humans fighting eachother.

The fish out of water trope is too played out, and they dedicated way too much of the movie getting Mila\u2019s character(I don\u2019t remember her name) used to the idea of monsters, when they could have just had her fighting monsters as someone who already lived in that world. \n\nIt\u2019s mostly maddening that they introduced the hunter character\u2019s speaking a different language, which makes the movie drag even more. It was an unnecessary barrier between Mila and Tony, just to give them a \u201cfunny\u201d dynamic, and when that served it\u2019s purpose they needed someone to actually translate between them, hence Ron Pearlman\u2019s character, who ONLY speaks english the rest of the movie anyway.\n\nThey inject elements of the video game, but seemingly only for fan service, like with the Chef Palico and a few other characters like the Handler and the Serious Handler. If they actually developed them as characters, then it would have been amazing. Instead they get killed by a Rathalos while trying to fight it, which is something that is super out of character since the handlers are never actually supposed to fight anything. The movie was also unflinchingly brutal, killing off multiple people in some horrific ways. Anderson went for a realistic interpretation, fighting monsters like the Diablos and Rathalos would lead to some painful deaths, but the tone clashes with the over the top actions the characters perform and the general light tone of the video game.

If they somebow make a sequel I would probably end up watching it though.\n\nFor reference the only MH game Ive played is world. And as to what monster movies I enjoyed in recent years: Love & Monsters, The Meg, Kong: SI, Godzilla:KOTM, Rampage, Pacific Rim (not the sequel) well, I enjoyed these a lot and would rate them a 7/10 or above.", "Dylan O'Brien really turns mediocre movies into pretty good movies. I really like the guy. \n\nThis movie wasn't mediocre, though.

Dope monsters, Ron Pearlman with a switchaxe, and good main actors. Dumb plot, but it's pretty irrelevant to what I wanted from a monster hunter movie. Glad we got some nercylla and gore magala to rep monhun4, even if Gore is sequel bait. Rathalos is the king and black diablos is fucking cool.\n\nIdk why the movie was SO gory, but it worked pretty well with how zany and slapstick this movie was.

Cold, particularly that of chilled liquids, represent resignation or distance, and the temptation thereof. Finally I wish to put forth the notion that water and all things aquatic represent balance and life itself.\n\nLet me start with water, the source of all life. Throughout the film water plays a central part, not only as the alternative to alcohol, but also as a symbol for life itself, living, balance or simply being present and \"alive\". The most obvious case of this is if course the fact that you should, unless you want a hangover, balance your intake of alcohol and water. Water is also the alternative to the somewhat destructive alcohol, but it is also the main constituent of every drink. Also, all life stems from the ocean, and humans die without water, so there's that. But let us look at the way this is expressed in the film in less obvious ways. A characters proximity or relationship to water will often represent how much, or how well, they are living or \"alive\", as well as their relationship to alcohol.\n\nTommy, the oldest of the gang, drowned. He couldn't handle life, and so his life was reclaimed by the sea. He was also the only one who couldn't swim, a clear parallel. Yet, Tommy had not only lived a longer, but maybe more of a life, than the others, as he was older and was divorced. He had experience with life, and thus he was the only owner of a boat, you know, because the sea is life.\n\nNikolaj, the bearded psychology teacher, lives a pretty good life. He lives in a house with a view of the sea, and we not only go there later, but Nikolaj even mentions this at his party as one of the signs that he has a good life. He is permanently close to water, close to being truly \"alive\", even if he is troubled by some minor leaking issues. Martin, however, also has a wife, kids and the same job, but he lives nowhere near water. In the beginning of the birthday party scene, Martin drinks water. Plain sparkling water, no lemon, please. Sure, he is living, but living a plain, boring life. When Martin truly starts to live, thanks to alcohol, he takes his family canoeing on a lake, something they haven't done in years. The relationship between Martin and Anika haven't been alive in years, but for \"ten minutes\", as Martin later puts it, it is. In the end, Martin, now having maybe found a spark or way to get back to living (he is dancing again after all this time) throws himself into the sea, into life.\n\nThis theme manifests itself many more times throughout the film, it even opens with a bunch of young people enjoying life around a lake. Peter is present enough to notice the struggling student while washing his hands, he also drunkenly jumps into the harbor, but swims, and we later learn he has met a woman and helps a student pass his exam. Almost everything they eat comes from the sea (caviar, cod, prawns), and when they are drunk and loosing their grip on the experiment they fail at both buying a fish and catching one. In the final scene in Tommy's apartment before he dies, water is suspiciously absent: we see Martin feed Tommy's dog, but not give it water, they eat pasta, not seafood, and the dishes are cleaned into the trash and not washed in the sink above.\n\nI would like to quickly include three more scenes and my interpretations. The first one is the fishing scene. Martin, who is now using alcohol to kind of cheat at \"living\", maybe having misunderstood it's purpose in a balanced life, is also misusing the fishing net as a spear to \"cheat\" at catch a fish. The second scene is the fireside 20-questions Martin has with his family. He is embodying an animal and the others are guessing which animal he chose. His wife, a woman who is still somewhat in touch with life, asks him if he lives in the sea. Martin declines. I interpret this as Anika asking him if he is someone who is ready, or even able, to live, but in Martins own mind he still thinks of himself, or maybe knows, he is not somebody who is ready to live unaided by alcohol. He is not a fish. This might lead Anika to let slip her affair to Martin later, as she now knows it is hopeless to wait any more. The final scene is the first scene with Martin and Anika, where he asks her if he is boring. In this scene Martin is reading, and Anika is readying herself to go to work, or as it is revealed later, meet another man. This is foreshadowed by Anika readying herself by going into the bathroom, where the water is, because she is \"living\", and when Martin asks if he is boring, the camera finally brings into focus the poster on the wall: An old poster of seashells. Once alive in the ocean, now dead, fossilized and barely a memory of the life it had in the ocean. Just like Martin. This is repeated a few minutes later when Martin is leaving for the party: Anika is going out, so she briefly visits the bathroom, and Martin is in the foreground failing to live, with the poster in the background. Not to mention another fish-poster in his kitchen a few moments later, like a photo of a Martin that once was.\n\nNow let us briefly cover the many cold moments of the film. I get it, a movie about alcohol is bound to include some ice, but there are many gratuitous frames of cold glasses and ice.   I propose this symbolizes resignation and distance, and the temptation of indulging in this. This is perhaps most notable in the scene between Martin and Anika where they meet in the restaurant and Anika orders a chilled glass of wine, while Martin drinks water. Anika is resigned from the relationship. Some time before this, Nikolajs wife specifically tells her husband she wants fresh cod, not frozen. She is still invested in their relationship, and reminds her husband not to forget this. At the end, the men are battered and defeated by the loss of their friend, and thus they are given cold glasses to drink from. At the beginning Martin is persuaded by the chilled vodka to start drinking and forget his plans for the next day, and later by the magnificently misting drink with a huge ice ball in it. Martin also hides his alcohol under a bag of ice in his freezer.\n\nFinally I would like to discuss the theme of light and darkness, as well as open spaces and confined spaces, as a symbol of control, coping and relationship to alcohol. The film both opens and ends with people enjoying alcohol, and to a larger extend, life, outside in the sun. Nikolaj, the person with the most control and \"best\" life, lives in a bright and open house, with large windows looking out over the sea, drinking openly in his home. Martin lives in a more enclosed house with fewer windows, and frequently sits in more darkness than others, and in the beginning he is visibly more exposed and vulnerable in his brightly lit classroom than his friends. He is more private with his drinking, often standing in front of a large window in his study room. Perhaps this is where he can feel relaxed and in control? Tommy on the other hand lives in a small apartment with few windows, most covered by something, but he is also outside a lot, showing how his character tries to appear as in control to others, but privately is slipping, as he is seen both hiding and stashing his alcohol and deceiving others when it comes to when/how he drinks. \n\nPeter goes on a journey. He starts of with an open music hall and office, but as the drinking starts to get out of hand, he closes the curtains in both the music hall and his office, and starts to drink hidden alcohol. In the end, after regaining more control, he is seen in bright classrooms helping the struggling student cope. This visual motif is present other places in the film, such as when Peter discovers the crying student and takes him from a brightly lit hallway into a dimly lit classroom, or how the men are dancing and having fun in Nikolajs open living room, then being a nuance in the dark, windowless pub, or how Nikolaj starts by being peed on while sleeping in the open living room, then later pees himself in the small bedroom or how the happy students in the opening turn into hooligans after dark in the cramped tram. One could even argue that Tommy ends up in one of the most confined spaces imaginable.\n\nDoes anybody else share my interpretation?", "Even with just a general knowledge of Danish drinking culture, I really enjoyed this and it made me reflect on my American drinking culture, particularly college and my friends who've been unable to get out of that mindset. Mads is always great, and his collaborations with Thomas Vinterberg haven't disappointed.", "I thought most of the movie was lower-tier Vinterberg but man, that last scene is just utterly fantastic. Having seen Lover's Rock the week before this too, I wish we get more movies with uninterrupted dance sequences. They're absolutely the best, especially in a shit year like this.", "My favourite of the year so far. The movie has one of the best endings in recent years. Mads-Vinterberg collabs can never be missed.", "The fact the film managed to make you so emotionally invested in all four main characters was amazing. Like the scenes with the student who had to retake the year could\u2019ve been extraneous but ended up being so heartwarming. \n\nAnd yes, that beautiful ending.", "What a great movie. Second best of the year for me after Trial of The Chicago 7.\nI find movies about 40-somethings and middle-age crises very relatable, even though i\u2019m in my 20s. That feeling of being lost and wondering where\u2019a all the hope and promise of being 16 and happy?\n\nVinterberg is a really great director. This, Festen, The Hunt. All amazing movies.\nFreeze frame at the end is perfect.\n\nAlso, how hilarious was that cut from them in the store buying fresh cod, realizing they don\u2019t have it, and cut to them trying to catch it? I laughed. Just awesome.", "Loved it, probably my favourite of the year. I don't think the message is as simple as \"drinking can be good for you but don't so it too much.\"\n\nI think it was that alcohol can loosen you up a bit but ultimately it's you that has to make the change within yourself. Alcohol made Nikolaj admit to himself he was unhappy with his family life (and exacerbate it) and he makes the choice to improve it. Peter admits he wants a partner and is dating someone by the end of the movie. Tommy perhaps doesn't see much of a life for himself and falls into alcoholism leading to his demise.\n\nAlcohol makes Martin feel good but outside of one camping trip it doesn't make him a more present father/husband. Even when at his drunkest, he refuses to dance despite encouragement from his friends, he's not able to be his true self. It's not til the end when he's suffered loss, connected with his students and decided to try and rebuild his marriage that he's finally able to dance. Alcohol took him on a wild ride, and magnified the positive and negative aspects of himself/his life, but ultimately he had to make the choice to grow before he could feel like himself.", "Not related to Another Round, but everyone who likes Mads Mikkelsen should see Pusher 2. \n\nAmazing film and an amazing performance.", "Besides the drinking themes, the film is also a box of condensed Danish culture. Everything in the movie is extremely Danish. The pop music. The classical music and choir songs. The high school graduates with red band hats celebrating their freedom driving from home to home in the back of a decorated truck. The fancy Copenhagen gourmet restaurants. The bodegas (pubs) with draft beer. The quotes from Soren Kirkegaard. The diffent types of homes and classical architecture and design. The lakes and the ocean. It is basically an homage to Danish culture.", "Can someone explain the meaning of the ending to me? I don\u2019t really understand what message the movie was trying to send.", "This movie was fucking amazing, RIP coach. Specs and I are going to miss you.\n\nApparently this all hit close to home for the director? Don't really get it but they and the rest of their team made a great film regardless.", "i thoroughly enjoyed this, and it was very funny, bittersweet, moving - and when i got to the \"For Ida\" dedication at the end, i looked into it, and boy, is that a heartbreaking backstory to the film", "Wow that final scene was fucking incredible. It hurts to know that no matter what I do in life i\u2019ll never be nearly as cool as Mads Mikkelsen. He\u2019s something else entirely", "I went into this film totally blind, only seeing it briefly discussed online as a contender come award season, and I\u2019m blown away.\n\nThe direction is superb. Mads\u2019 performance is sublime, one of this year\u2019s best. The ending is cathartic. Damn, I loved this so much.", "Wow what a great movie. Just beautifully shot and told. Mads is so excellent in it. \n\nThis along with Sound of Metal are my 2 favourite movies of the year.", "What a great movie, probably my favorite of the year. Man, poor Tommy. I had a feeling that was going to happen and yet it still hit hard. \n\nGod that scene with Mads and his wife in the restaurant was heartbreaking.\n\nBeautiful ending and love that song. Downloaded it immediately after lol.", "So Tom committed suicide right?", "The ending was so devastating but so good at the same time. \n\nWith the state of the industry this year this should make a play for best picture.", "Really love the movie \u2018the hunt\u2019 previously from this director so was excited to check this out. He always brings up interesting questions and topics that feel truthful and challenge you.\n\nAnother round does a lot of the same. I love how it depicts alcohol. It shows our complicated relationship with it, and as someone with a complicated relationship with alcohol, I appreciate that. You can have great times with it, or it can be your worst enemy. It\u2019s not bad or good, it just, is.\n\nWatching this also made me miss my buds, can\u2019t wait til we can get back to some form of normal.\n\nThe movie has a lot of funny moments intertwined with the drama, I think it\u2019s a good balance. All the cast is great too, but mads really elevates this film. What a talent. That dance number may be one of my favourite scenes of 2020. I do think the movie drags a little at times, and I could have done with less of the mads and his wife subplot. Though I think it\u2019s a different film without it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about this movie without mentioning the tragedy behind it. The director\u2019s daughter died during the filming of it in a car crash. She was even supposed to play a part in the film and the movie is dedicated to her. I can\u2019t even imagine what that must be like, and to finish the film still? Thankful, but I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if he didn\u2019t.\n\nDug it though a lot. Very danish, asks a lot of great questions and is still a good time. Cinematography is top notch too, I feel like a lot of these films from Northern Europe have similar vibes, maybe because they can all speak like 9 languages? I don\u2019t know, makes me want to check out Denmark. The drinking age is like 16 there though? Wild.", "Finally got a chance to watch this. I think it really comes together in the final scenes and the final dance is such a cathartic release that I def started crying a bit. Both because it was a great conclusion for Martin, but I know that\u2019s what it\u2019ll probably be like when we\u2019re all out of this fucking Corona mess.", "I finished this movie eternally grateful that I don\u2019t drink.", "Really surprised at the rating over here. I mean, 6,46?! Come on, this is easily on of the best movies of the year!", "I liked it. The first act was really great, but the second act started to feel a bit grindy. \n\nHowever, I decided to push through it and the cathartic release at the end of the film is just perfect. I can see why some people will like it and why some people don't. It's just not for everyone.\n\nI also personally found the comedy rather weak. But the comedy, to me, is the only weak point of the film. Everything else was great.", "Really glad the film took a positive outlook in the ending, and well, life and relationships with alcohol (and people). Although given the background it couldn't end any other way and not be a celebration of life despite its hardships.\n\nI'm sure someone here as mentioned but it has got me excited for living again post lockdown. I miss celebrating everything - Christmas, new year's, birthdays, football, just general stupid nights out. Maybe just not always beyond the point of \"ignition\"! And certainly not with Mads dance moves as much as I'd like to try.", "I'm in my last year of education and suffer from anxiety and Sebastian's portrayal nailed it perfectly. The very early mornings, the sobbing, the feelings of despair, the knowing you need X grade to make it to where you need to be but feeling like you'd be lucky to even pass, nothing going in, forgetting everything you know when the exam starts. Every bit of it struck a chord with me. \n\nThe actor nailed it perfectly and I hope he has a bright future ahead of him. \n\nI felt seen by the film (which is kind of ironic when you think about it) and I'm grateful for that.", "This reignited my love for Mads, time to rewatch Hannibal", "Can somebody explain the poll results to me? Most people gave it an 4 or 5, yet the comments are almost all overwhelmingly positive. I really liked the film as well and gave it an 8 (Mads is amazing and I loved the ending), so I'm a little confused, why most people disliked it so much.", "This knocked Palm Springs from the top spot of the year for me.", "This was the best film I saw this year. All cast was great but especially Mads was amazing. I hope Mads and Thomas Vinterberg make more films together. Also I saw many articles about best films  according to Hollywood critics or Hollywood related awards but Another Round is ignored by them. I guess it is usual except a few rare films world cinema is always ignored by Hollywood but then they claim the films they picked are the best films not best American films.

Viola is good too but Chadwick steals the show.", "I know Chadwick Boseman's undeniably superb performance will get the most interest due his tragic passing but holy hell, Viola Davis is really one of the beat actresses of all time. The physicality she brings to the role was something only a masterclass actor could pull off. The performances are truly great but the film itself was just okay. What works as a stage play doesn't necessarily translate to film. The film needed a better screenwriter who could adapt the play for the screen. It's still worth watching just for the performances though.", "Somewhat random and unrelated, but last year, Netflix released a documentary mini series following Kevin Hart and the fallout from his anti-LGBTQ comments and subsequent bowing out from hosting the Oscars.\n\nOne episode covered Hart's production company, wherein he pitched to Chadwick Boseman his idea for a movie. I can't recall the details, but I do remember Hart making a big deal out of it and figuring it was a \"sure thing\" that Boseman would star in his bullshit movie.\n\nDuring the pitch meeting, Boseman turned Hart down, basically saying he's careful about the roles he chooses and the impact they may have. At the time, I didn't think much about his reasoning for declining the part. Knowing now that he was battling terminal cancer when he met with Hart however, puts that segment from the episode into an entirely new light.\n\nBoseman didn't want to be remembered for quick payday roles in stupid lowest common denominator comedies, like Hart. His decision to play Levee in *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom* makes so much sense now, as this will be one of the roles for which he will be forever remembered. Deservedly so.", "Levee was an ambitious man who told people he was in complete control but really had no say or control other than what he says. When he didn't get what he wanted at the end he displaced all those negative feelings on to someone else, with terrible results. I feel for the guy and have met guys like that growing up.", "Something about Chadwick Boseman's final role involving him talking about his ambitions and how bright his future is going to be just feels like one more punch to the gut.", "There\u2019s nothing I can say about Viola or Chadwick that hasn\u2019t already been said. So instead, I\u2019ll say this: this year Colman Domingo has easily cemented himself as one of my favorites in Hollywood, to the point where I\u2019ll see something without knowing anything about it simply because Colman is in it.", "The performances are excellent - especially Davis and  Boseman. I went into this cold and was mesmerized from start to finish. It\u2019s a shame this is the last we\u2019ll see of Boseman, he\u2019s cocky, energetic, passionate, scary.", "Get Chadwick his Oscar NOW! Goddamnit that scene of him questioning God when we know that he was battling terminal cancer just crushed me. It\u2019s a tragedy that he\u2019s gone, but his last film is his best work ever. Wow.", "Boseman delivered a knockout in his last role. People might say that he gets the oscar because of his passing, but i truly believe he is earning it with this (and also the fact that the year seems weaker in general for awards)", "A one, a. two, a you know what to do....", "The adaptation from stage to screen was not all that successful to me. That being said, Viola Davis was amazing. There was a physicality to her performance that transcended those stage limitations. The way she walked with her hip out, all plastered in makeup and sweat\u2014commanding stuff. She was big when she needed to be, but other times sage-like or seductive. Really well-rounded performance.", "So, I had the great pleasure of working on this film, and finally got to watch the end result.\n\nStory wise, I think this works better as a live theater experience. However, I had the great pleasure of sitting in on a few meetings with the director and thinking back to him explaining his vision, I think he did a masterful job in pulling out the performances he got from Boseman and Davis. They are unbelievable.\n\nOverall, a great story and very beautifully executed. Very proud to have been a part of this production in my capacity. I can only imagine how incredible this must be performed live.", "I\u2019m going to miss you Chadwick", "Electrifying. An amazing ensemble paired with a powerful script in a short time frame is just wonderful to watch", "I enjoyed learning about [August Wilson's cycle of ten plays](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilson#The_Pittsburgh_Cycle), each based on the African American experience in a different decade of the 20th century. This film is the one from the 20s, of course. It's the only one set in a location other than the playwright's native Pittsburgh.\n\nThe other play from this cycle that's been made into a movie is Fences, which I'm curious about now. Denzel Washington supposedly has plans to produce more.", "I didn't find the narrative particularly interesting but the performances are absolutely outstanding. It makes sense, I suppose, being based on a play that it's very much a performance heavy film.\n\nI kind of felt that the ending (with Toledo's death) came out of nowhere but I understand the point that the film/play is trying to make. Despite all his talk, Levee is deeply traumatized by what happened to his parents and to him and he is walking around with all this rage and anger trying to turn it into something. He tries at first to channel it into his music and he is talented but he's stymied by the opportunities he can get (also I totally assumed that Mr. Irvin was stealing his songs to give them to another band - I was shocked he even offered to pay for them at the end. After all, why take the songs if you aren't planning to use them?). Some of Levee's problems are of his own making, of course, he's obnoxious, he's rude and he's combative and that certainly doesn't help you get any further in life and he throws away a good opportunity with Ma Rainey's band because he doesn't want to just follow the rules. Anyway in the end, I thought at first that he would stab Mr. Irvin because of Chekov's knife and all but instead he turns that violence onto an innocent person, someone who is just as oppressed as he is, someone who has shown him nothing but kindness for the most part - in part, because he knows from his father's experience, that he could never kill a white man and get away with it (not that Irvin deserved to die for stealing someone's music). It's a very heavy ending. \n\nI find that this era of American plays tend to deal heavily with the casualties of the American Dream. You're sold a bill of goods but they'll never come through for you and you spend your whole life chasing a phantom. I think those messages are still relevant, if not more so now, than they were when they were written.", "So, what are y'all thinking about the end where Levee kills Toledo? I was interpreting it as the yellow shoes being symbolic of his optimism for the future and his come up, and Toledo's clodhoppers are Black folks' past, stepping all over and messing up his dreams.", "I'm surprised to find comments that the movie was slow or boring. Throughout the movie I was smitten by the amazing performances as well as the colorful personalities and perspectives of the characters. Their conversations and storytelling really laid it all out for us - each band member's life, beliefs, worries, traumas. One hour into the movie I was feeling for everyone in the band, even for the ambitious and erratic Levee. But it was really Ma Rainey who tied it all together at the end.\n\nI could not help think \"God, Ma Rainey is being really difficult.\" She came to the studio late, brought her stuttering nephew to take even more time recording, and threatened multiple times she won't record until everything is done her way.  I mean, I thought I knew why -- the music industry was brutal, especially for black musicians whose talents were appropriated shamelessly. As Ma Rainey puts it, they only want her voice.  But for me the real chills came with the scene where those white musicians were playing the song that Sturdyvant swindled from Levee for mere $5. Then Ma Rainey sitting in the backseat of her car looked straight back at the viewers, like she's saying \"see? I told you so.\" That's gotta be my favorite scene, it was so poignant and heartbreaking. I watched the film last night but I'm still thinking about it.\n\nWhat I'm still curious about is, what purpose do the characters Dussie Mae and Sylvester play? What does the writer (of the play & film) want to say through those two? Still haven't figured that out.", "I just want to say that I don't think he really stepped on his shoes.... He couldn't fight the person who had really stepped on him...", "This movie feels like it was supposed to be longer.", "It was a great movie not the best of the year for me. Viola and Chadwick both deserve nominations. Can we talk about that ending whyyyyy so sad.", "I thoroughly enjoyed this and am slightly appalled by some of the critiques I\u2019ve seen\n\nWhile it has largely been received well by critics and audiences alike, the negative reviews have condemned it as far too boring which I can\u2019t agree with at all\n\nThe dialogue may have given the impression of rambling at times, more specially when the band members are interacting with each other, but each word uttered is reflective of the characters and their respective mindsets\n\nChadwick and Davis were exceptional of course, and I don\u2019t see how one could view his performance with anything other than admiration and applause\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this movie, perhaps more than I should? Maybe it comes down to me being seventeen and lacking a desire for further nuance in some aspects of the film but this was a great film with dynamic characters that highlighted aspects of Black film that aren\u2019t frequently covered. Levee rejecting god is incredibly impactful because he\u2019s a Black man and his reasons for doing so are unique at least based on the other films I\u2019ve seen that try to highlight historical issues within the Black community. \n\nSome were also complaining about Ma\u2019s personality and saying that she was too cruel or egotistical when she directly states why she treats the people around her like she does. The treatment of Black people in the music industry is still horrendous to this day, and you can see her message of them not caring about anything other than the money that comes with her voice and music become more blatant towards the end with Levee being told initially that he could record his songs then being told that they weren\u2019t good enough only for them to be played by a White band (only further reflecting the ways in which Black inventions and art have been stolen).\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this film, it\u2019s an 8/10 for me undoubtedly. I actually would\u2019ve liked it to be longer if anything.", "This was so good. I was blown away by the monologue about his family. I also saw another post about the scene where he\u2019s yelling to God about letting terrible things happen all while he was battling terminal cancer. Jesus. \ud83d\udc94 if you didn\u2019t, I\u2019d recommend the little behind the scenes episode they suggested after the movie. I really enjoyed getting more information on the play, the people, etc.", "I went in wondering if all the hype around Boseman was just because he died.  \n  \nGlad I was wrong. What an absolute force of nature he is in this film. The \"Levee needs to be Levee\" scene was incredible. I don't care how long it is, just play that entire scene for his Oscars clip.", "Big day for The Wire.\n\nClarence Royce getting the knife he deserved.\n\nBrother Mouzone laying the pipe on the upright bass", "Contrary to many of the other comments, I felt it translated from stage to screen well.  The story is set in a recording studio, so finding ways to translate chunks of dialog to other settings would have been less realistic.  Viola Davis was so believable as Rainey and confident enough in her acting to look all sweaty and such.  The rest of the cast was great, too.\n\nI saw a local production of Wilson\u2019s Jitney a couple years ago and I hope Washington/Netflix do it soon.  It has a similar rhythm to the dialog and interplay between the characters", "Just watched it and was engrossed from beginning to end. Chadwick's performance, in parralel to knowing he had terminal cancer whilst shooting, shook me to my core. Outstanding film that'll stick with me for a very long time.", "Individual scenes? Great. Performances? Superb. Commentary? On-point and, unfortunately, still relevant. But I don't know what people are seeing in this to make it \"the film of the year\". Maybe I'm missing something. The narrative arc felt flat and disjointed to me. Conflicts would go left without resolution, scenes abruptly cut to later for no reason without resolving the thread started earlier. We never even see them finish recording \"Black Bottom\" after the mean white dude sabotages the good take, it just cuts to another scene. Maybe that's the point of it but it left me feeling bored at the start of many new scenes until those could grab my attention in their own right. There wasn't much momentum to this film. Really the recording story just served as a loose framework to support the monologues. I realize this is based on a play based on a real person's life but I think the movie could have hit the same thematic notes in a more compelling way with a story that takes place over the course of a tour rather than a single day's recording session.\n\nWhat I did enjoy was the apt depiction of the exploitative blues recording industry of the early 20th century. The music business has never been friendly to artists but I don't think anybody has had it worse than these early black artists. I knew where Levee's songs were going to end up as soon as the studio owner started delivering the bad news. Viola Davis did an incredible job of channeling Ma Rainey's righteous indignation as a black woman who deserves far more than she gets and knows it well, and the strength that woman must have to stand up for herself in a white man's society.\n\nIn the end I certainly enjoyed it, but I wish I could call it anything more than just \"good\". Maybe I'll read some more discussion and change my mind.", "I went into this not knowing anything. I was taken away by Boseman and Davis. I\u2019ve never seen the play so I can\u2019t speak to that, but the symbolism was heavy but not too in your face. Boseman\u2019s whole monologue about his mother was amazing. I really enjoyed this movie", "Alright, Chadwick is getting nominated and winning for Best Actor at this moment.\n\nI know everybody has been ranting and raving over Anthony Hopkins for his role in The Father, and how it's probably the best performance of his career.\n\nBut at the moment, he's going to win.\n\nHis performance, coupled with his death will put him over the top, a la Heath Ledger (even though Heath's competition his year was \"weak\")", "Viola Davis deserves all the awards for this. Chadwick does too. all of it would have fallen apart if the script wasn't as strong as the performances.", "I love the production design, cinematography and powerful performances by Boseman and Davis.\n\nThat scene about god and knowing what happened to Chadwich was hard to watch :(\n\nIs he the favorite right now? This weird year I haven\u2019t seen many movies so no idea what other performances are close", "Swear to god, Chadwick BETTER win\n\nThe movie\u2019s great, though not astounding, but my goodness the performances. Davis and especially Boseman will deservingly get the acclaim, but Glynn Turman and Coleman Domingo are phenomenal as well. Costume design is also a sure thing come awards season", "Every close-up of Chadwick was haunting. What a brilliant performance.", "Best Actor for Chadwick.  Like god damn.  Such a powerful performance and possibly his best", "Going into this without knowing anything, is this basically a movie about black suffering?", "I really enjoyed this movie and the making of documentary that came with it. I want to know what you guys think the brick wall at the end of the movie symbolizes? I think it symbolizes Levee\u2019s career aspirations. Throughout the movie we see him try to open the locked door to escape the rehearsal and when he does during the climax of the movie, it\u2019s a brick wall showing he has nowhere to go. \n\nThe director says that it represents the American Dream but I don\u2019t really see it. \n\nDid you see something different?", "This movie was pretty much a class on acting. Chadwick killed it, and it breaks my heart that he left us before he assuredly would gotten an oscar nomination.", "I\u2019ve gotta say that this film really, really blew me away. Watched it with the whole family and Boseman\u2019s first monologue struck us silent. It\u2019s very rare for me to be wholly captured by one character speaking for a long time - not that I have a short attention span or anything but the evocativeness Boseman brought in that scene; the way in which my throat tensed with emotion, I wanted to cry but I also couldn\u2019t because I was just so focused, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of him. \n\nI knew he was good but my god, this was beyond. \n\nNot to mention the fact that the rest of the cast was stellar. Viola as Ma Rainey drew me in entirely; what a character! Her sass, straight up \u2018no shit\u2019 attitude, walk\u2019n\u2019talk and everything - I don\u2019t know how much of her character was true but to be a black woman like that, acting like she didn\u2019t give a fuck in THAT time? \n\nA whole motherfucking G. \n\nMy props to Domingo - I smiled when I saw him on screen. Loved him in Euphoria and now even more so!", "I loved the acting, all of the monologues and banter, but I expected a film and not a filmed play. This is Fences all over again.\n\nViola and Chadwick have an overwhelming energy, they're too good for this world. They deserved better direction and writing.", "God DAMN Viola was captivating in this! Completely became Ma Rainey. And Boseman! God it was sad seeing him act his ass off in his last role ever :,(\nI thought the superficial \u201cgreen screen\u201d look to everything kinda hindered the film but man were those performances amazing.", "Film of the year. Performances of the year. \n\nI have no words. This was incredible.\n\nEdit: I lied, I have more words. The symbolism, man. The fucking symbolism was everywhere. Jesus, what a film.", "If Viola isnt nominated for an Oscar, its because she was robbed.  Chadwick's final performance was also very good and shows what a tragedy his loss will be to this art form.  Overall, better take than most plays converted to movies IMO.  I still think its likely way better in its native format though.", "When Cutler started his story and Levee went to the stairs I knew it was supposed to be or was based on a play. The movie felt like a bottle episode, with a dialogue-heavy script and scenes taking place in the same locations.", "Rare for a film to me hit me so hard emotionally. Maybe it's because its Chadwick's last film? I'm not sure but hot damn, everyone here deserves Oscars. The cast works together in a perfect synergy, working off of a phenomenally written script. The music, set design and characters will resonate with me for years. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is the perfect example of when everything goes right in a film's production. Boseman gives us one last final performance and holy hell, it's a career best for him. He's a scene stealer and arguably the main character/heart of the story. I love this film more than anyone can even imagine. It made me want to buy a trumpet and learn to play.", "Intense and fast pace.", "Great performances that definitely make this work as much as this did for me. It's upsetting and grim, overall heavy stuff but I think the performances sold all the monologues and storytelling moments.", "About 20 minutes in, I asked my SO if this was based on a play, because you can really feel that it is. I don't like that feeling, because it takes me out of the film. Everything is told, not shown, which feels antithetical to a film.\n\nThat being said, it's a pretty great piece of acting and...I dunno, theatre? Chadwick is fantastic and the entire time, I couldn't help but think about what a career he would have had over the next 20-30 years. Everyone else is great too, I love how Viola Davis fills out the role, both physically and emotionally. All around great performances, but Boseman\u2019s is the show stealer", "Narrator: Toledo did, in fact, get mixed up in all this.", "Anyone interested in music, film, and Chadwick Boseman should watch \"Get On Up\" about the life story of James Brown.  Chadwick Boseman was phenomenal in that as he was in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" but \"Get on Up\" is a movie while MRBB is essentially a play that is filmed.", "The first third dragged for me, before Ma Rainey shows up in full. I wasn't sure yet what themes or plot the movie was to convey, and this was when it really felt the most like a play to me.\n\nThe film took a while to get going, but once it does it's really quite powerful. Similarly, it took me a bit to get used to Chadwick Boseman's performance (it's so manic and flashy), but after his first big monologue I was fucking IN. Speechless at the end of that, I said aloud to my wife \"Holy shit, that was incredible.\" Honestly the acting all around is very impressive, including of course Viola Davis and the entire supporting cast of musicians.\n\nI do think the ending (in the basement room) came out of nowhere. I can definitely see that working better on stage than in a film, because honestly I was just left with more questions than... The actual last shot (new band recording) I really loved! Great way to close out the movie and really hit the themes home.", "I just got to watching this film with my family, and boy I loved it. Chadwick's performance as a smooth-talking, ambitious, talented but ultimately traumatized musician is a bittersweet sendoff. Viola Davis is again showing us how she's one of the best actresses of this generation - Ma didn't take shit from anybody but Viola found a way to make me like her. \n\nOne thing I don't think people give enough credit to was the rest of the cast. I cared about each and every member of the band, and loved the way they acted with one another. Toledo genuinely became my favourite character, which [spoiler] made his death hurt all the more. Even Irvin and Sturdyvant played their roles to a T. \n\nBut you can clearly tell that this film was a play. The unity of time and place means this film would be perfect if it was on stage. The performances from the actors were near perfect in my eyes, but I feel the medium lets it down - just because the script was clearly written for the stage.", "Good acting, but just ok apart from that. To be honest I was really bored.\n\nDefinitely not an oscar contender outside of acting awards.", "This was one of the more literal play to movie adaptations I\u2019ve ever seen.", "I found that this moved too slow. It was pretty obviously a stage production first, and a movie adaption second. No doubt, the actors were incredible but the movie took too long to really get started.", "Chadwick Boseman.", "Chadwick Boseman is a ferocious revelation but the movie is pretty messy behind him.", "What an extraordinary talent Chadwick Boseman was! I\u2019ve seen some of his most famous screen roles, but I don\u2019t think he had a chance to display such a range and depth in previous parts. He owns the movie, for sure. \n\nWe can tell the script\u2019s most poignant moments come from the stage play, whose beautifully written dialogues remain mostly intact. They still shine, but sometimes we have to squint to notice them, because the direction is mostly uninspired and, IMO, can't make this feel like a real film rather than a recorded version of a play.", "Does anyone know what happen with Leeve in real life after he killed Toledo ?", "Bozeman and Davis? Great acting performances. Movie itself and its structure? Thoroughly mediocre.", "ok, i guess i disagree with everyone so far, but i think this adaptation was claustrophobic (but not in a good way) and hammed up. i personally love august wilson, but this adaptation was lazy and i didn\u2019t like it at all"], "num_comments": 279, "year": "2020"}, {"title": "Midnight Sky", "comments": ["I saw it last night, I wasn\u2019t expecting much as I\u2019ve never been much a fan of Clooney\u2019s work but I was actually surprised at how dull it really is.

And when they approach those asteroids, the ship is moving at a few hundred miles per hour at most relative to the asteriods even though the crew is returning from JUPITER? And instead of tearing the spaceship to shreds, the rocks just kind of bounce off the ship?

This is one of those movies where the idea and general sequence of events was great in theory, and the movie could have been excellent rather then just decent with the same cast but with a different director and a much tighter script.\n\nI enjoyed the credits very much too. As much as the resolution falls apart (2 people=near guaranteed extinction), it was as smooth a follow-up to Clooney\u2019s last scene as could be asked for.\n\nIn terms of spaceship spectacles with thin plots held together by fantastic visuals and acting, *Ad Astra* completely blows this movie out of the water.", "Maybe I\u2019m in a contemplative mood because this film really touched me emotionally (Clooney\u2019s story) I\u2019ve not seen anyone commenting about the theme of this film, which is regret.  The space scenes aside, I thought the visuals on Earth were stunning and the fact that he imagined his daughter with him on his journey, which he knows will be his last, caring for her, looking out for her, something he clearly wishes he could have done in life and immensely regrets, was so utterly sad.  Whilst it was obvious Sully was his daughter, I didn\u2019t see that the little girl was her.

The only real attempt of a bit of exitment was Clooney mimicing Gravity", "Myself I enjoyed the movie. Not great, a bit cliche in some parts but overall not bad. I had a thought about the girl. What if Iris wasn\u2019t a complete hallucination? What if up until he loses her in the storm she is real. Possibly someone who looked a lot like his daughter. In the first part of the movie there are indications she may be real. The bowl, the fire, moving the gun and supplies on the ice. But during the storm she gets lost or taken by the wolves. After that he hallucinates her to keep going. A bit more of a tragic twist to the story. Not that everyone on earth dying isn\u2019t already tragic.", "Just watched the movie and now I\u2019m confused. So many questions.\n\n1. Did he know Sully was his daughter the whole time or only when she mentioned her mother\u2019s name in the end?

If Iris was a hallucination from the beginning, who started the fire in the kitchen? Or was it just a random fire?", "Best to remember this a film meant for entertainment and not every little detail is gonna be accurate in terms of the science or how things actually work. It\u2019s a sci-fi film. That being said, yes my logical brain had much of the same complaints as many of you. But those were easily set aside when I remembered this is a film after all, not a documentary. \n\nIn my opinion, this film actually has nothing to do with \u201chope\u201d or \u201csurvival\u201d. So I think the criticism that two people can\u2019t repopulate a planet is kinda a shallow observation. I can see how that would be the most satisfying ending, yet, it\u2019s also one that\u2019s been done a bunch of times already. In my opinion, I think that they have all accepted defeat in terms of saving humanity. They know they cannot save humanity with one couple and one child. They know. Yes, there is mention of a colony ship but even we can come to the conclusion that that ship likely did not make it off of earth. We know... the facts lead up to the extinction of humanity and I think they knew that too. It\u2019s the reason those two NASA pilots opted to go on that \u201csuicide trip\u201d. They opted to go home, with the chance of reuniting and dying with the ones they love. In the case of Sanchez, taking someone home who reminded him of his daughter. Both scenarios were acceptance of defeat. \n\nSurvival is kind of what we\u2019re all taught is the most important part of being human. Clooney\u2019s character put that notion above all else. Even going so far as to dismiss the woman he loved and his own daughter in order to do the work needed to save humanity. And in the end... he failed. And I think in the end he regretted not living. He put so much work into trying to save humanity, he himself did not live his own life. He did not get to know his own daughter. Neglected her for all of humanity only to realize that those efforts were not successful. I think he hallucinates his daughter for this very reason. You see him caring for her and bonding with her. His subconscious mind produces her because that dynamic is what he regrets in life. I believe he knew his daughter was on that ship. How could he not? And I think him making that journey to contact them was more about him wanting to finally introduce himself to her, his daughter, than an attempt to save humanity. His regret in life was not knowing his daughter, in essence not enjoying life in the moment, and so he sought to do that at the end of his life. That\u2019s why he becomes emotional when he finally introduces himself to her. It was clear to me that was his motivation in the end. Acknowledging that connection with his daughter and the importance of it. NOT saving humanity. As a parent I can say there is probably some relief in knowing that she will likely get to have a long life on a safe planet and not have to suffer on earth as well. After he\u2019s succeeded in gaining that information and finally meeting his daughter... he willingly walks away to his death. Finally at peace. Again, at least for me, this film isn\u2019t about hope or survival. It\u2019s about the importance of living while we\u2019ve got the chance.", "Read the book the film is based on, *Good morning, Midnight*a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it. Was excited to see the author as a consulting producer for the film as well. But man, so much deviation from the book that made the film seem almost like a different story all together. If you find the premise of this film interesting, the book is worth the read; background on Augustine and Sully are fleshed out much much more and the over the top dramatic and improbable moments are  toned down quite a bit. I found the ending of the book much more satisfying as well.", "SPOILERS:\n\nThere were so many questions I had. What the fuck was happening on Earth? They ask Clooney over and over yet he never answers. I want some answers. Why was the youngest male astronaut the captain? Why was he allowed to knock up one of his subordinates on a space mission and everyone was cool with that? Why did young Clooney look nothing like...young Clooney? \n\nIf they found a habitable moon why didn't they send more than one mission of only 5 people? Why did the astronauts even need Clooney's help? They figured out Earth was fucked on their own. The whole first half of the movie was watching an old man die slowly and 5 boring people moving around a massive spaceship with an oddly small crew. I'm disappointed.", "This was one of the most awful sci-fi movies I've seen. When Clooney began explaining to the aether about how the apocalypse began on earth, his transmission magically became garbled. And then a meteor storm hits the aether before he could repeat himself. This was an infuriating cocktease. I quit the movie at that point.", "Throughout the movie, the way Clooney wrote this movie became increasingly clear. He conceived of a number of cinematically powerful scenarios - dying man on a mission, father-daughter reconciliation, death of a friend, environmental Aesop cataclysm. Things that you can squeeze great performances out of.\n\nHe then attempts to construct a narrative frame around these moments, and it\u2019s so obvious that the actual world all this acting is occurring in was a secondary thought. \n\nFully habitable paradise moon of Jupiter that no one ever found, somehow. Don\u2019t ask.\n\nMagic apocalypse slow enough to for humans to react to/warn others about, but is encompassing the entire earth. Here\u2019s some convenient radio static, hope you weren\u2019t curious about literally any detail regarding the end of the Earth.\n\nGeorge Clooney is dying, too! Extra drama! What\u2019s he dying of? Beats me, but it\u2019s inconvenient enough to create some tension at the right moment. \n\nLike, I didn\u2019t hate the movie, mainly because everyone was clearly acting the shit out of the threadbare script, but there was no way for me to suspend my disbelief that much.", "I mean.. What to say. The movie looks gorgeous, starts off well, has some great actors, and i thought Clooney was really good.. But the plot/script. What a mess this is.\n\n- I understand that they tried to create some form of mystery/\"decide yourself\" on what happened to earth, but not showing anything at all is just silly. How can wolves survive? What was the point of the airplane-scene? I thought there would be some reveal, but no. Dead people. Where did people go on earth? Underground? Are they just waiting their imminent death? \n\n- They gave fractions of Clooney's past but not much is really explained. He was so busy with work that he just didn't give a fuck about the love of his life? About his daughter?\n\n- Falling into arctic water with no shelter and surviving. Yeah, right..\n\n- The whole space-crew plot is just such a cringefest. The sing-a-long?? Really? So this is obviously a very important mission they are on for humankind, and one of the crew-members is an 18 year old girl that hasn't even done a spacewalk before, throwing up before going? She's literally almost a child.. One of the women is knocked up by the captain on the ship? They are clearly taking this mission seriously.. Oh and of course the spacewalk turns into a disaster, who didn't see that coming? Why is the fucking pregnant woman going on the spacewalk?? \n\n- it's mindblowing how the crew just decides to split up, with two experienced men going down to earth, which Clooney advised against. Like, that was the whole purpose of his mission. Yeah, screw that, we're going anyway. The captain and his lover turns around to presumably continue the human race, with their unborn daughter. How nice.\n\nGeez, what a shitshow.", "I barfed when Sweet Caroline came on.", "Why did the other two return to Earth? In the video message doesn\u2019t she tell him where they are being sent? So why not go towards where his family is being evacuated to?", "I\u2019m frustrated you never found out how the planet got to that point! \n\nAlso, I started skipping ahead ten seconds at a time because the space walk part was complete filler and useless\n\nGeorge was good, was suspenseful but no pay off.", "Just like Ad Astra and Solalris, 'literary' sci-fi that ends up being neither an compelling character-driven movie or an interesting science fiction film. The excellent actors and nice visuals made this not a complete chore to watch but certainly not worth checking out unless you have nothing else to do and like Clooney.", "This didn't really feel like a movie. It was more like series of scenes that tried (and failed) to copy other successful sci-fis. Really bad.\n\nGlad I watched it though because I had a great time reading all the comments about how bad it was here.", "~spoilers~\n\nIt was okay.  Nice visuals, decent acting.  \n\nOverall, it's a slow story that is trying to contemplate the loneliness of the end of the world.  It's very character driven, and I think a lot of peoples' complaints about it stem from trying to view it through a \"plot-driven\" lens.  Augustine sees the end of himself and the world on the horizon, laments a life he feels was partially wasted pursuing his career instead of family.  But finds a last opportunity to help someone before the lights are out.  The crew was returning home from an optimistic mission but then are faced with a bleak reality.  They're not dumb, they know this is over for them too, though it might take some more decades than for everyone else.  So you see some return to the embrace of nostalgia, and some return to the embrace of discovery and hope.  \n\nThe biggest downsides for me were the abundance of bad science, and some of the dialogue was kind of meh.  No, there isn't a hidden habitable moon by Jupiter.  And what's more, Jupiter is not that far away.  We can communicate with satellites surrounding it already.  According to google, communication delay to Jupiter ranges from 33-53 minutes.  Long enough to prevent real-time communication, but close enough to be in constant contact with whoever is there.  And the trek across Antarctica was similarly unrealistic for so many reasons.  \n\nTo give the story a little credit, I think it's something that probably worked better in the original novel, where you could really explore the inner feelings of the characters as they observe their situations.  That kind of subtler subtext can make a book great but gets lost on screen, without some kind of narration which can often be clumsy.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6ish.  Closer to a 7 but I don't feel it earns the full 7.  Not bad, wish it were better.  I think people who like slower character movies, sci-fi, and post-apocalyptic stuff would like it.", "At some point Clooney takes a nap on the storm during a blizzard, just after swimming in the icy water.

For some reason, that first shot of the empty dining room looking out onto the frozen wasteland was really effective. The exterior of the spaceship was pretty cool. I like the webbed structural design of the interiors. The bloody airlock scene was nice.\n\nThe ending...why do movies need to be so clever and provide these \"twists\"? The editing was terrible. The fade between the young girl and Felicity is a sign the filmmakers think their audience is idiots.\n\nGeorge Clooney as a director is just...competent? His films always feel like he is a very nice boy coloring within the lines. \n\nSo yeah. If you're starving for new movies, maybe give it a try. There are some cool scenes.

So his entire trek was unnecessary. \n\nIf the point was just to get to the bigger antenna to broadcast the message, that too was pointless because he didn't make contact with them until they were close enough to Earth that the first antenna would have worked.\n\nAnd the whole thing with the little girl felt like a cheap twist and also meaningless. She's not as effective as Tyler Durden, because she never really compels Augustine to do something. He would have gone to the larger antenna even if he was alone.\n\nI dunno. It was decent overall, but I will probably never think about it again.

It\u2019s very simply about a dying man that wants to save the lives of a space mission.

Like, Sully's kid has a pretty dark date ahead of it, we really not gonna tackle that fact?\n\nInstead we get weird scenes with the cast bantering over a card game or having singalongs, but instead of being moments of poignant humanity amongst the dark they just seem tonally jarring. The fact that a quick action scene was thrown in every half an hour just to wake you up also felt tonally dissonant, especially the Arctic container randomly melting into the ocean out of nowhere. \n\nPlus, for a film about people responding to an apocalypse, it was annoyingly coy about _what_ said apocalypse was and why, for example, none of the other ships in space were 'online' anymore, or how the spaceships mission tied into what was going on down on Earth (was the search for habitable planets linked to whatever happened to kill everyone on Earth?)", "Where were the two guys planning on landing on Earth when they took the escape craft ?

I live near the Arctic circle, in a polar climate. You simply do not fall in water that is this frozen, DIVE IN to fetch a backpack and then not only come back up but also start your damn snowmobile. AND THEN put on your coat like nothing happened. Like that guy should have been dead 100x over, it's not even funny. \n\nThird, the space science was also legit terrible and clich\u00e9. How the hell did we miss a moon of Jupiter? We can literally see that planet in the sky, and have been able to for thousands of years. Not only that, we build what looks like a colony spaceship to host a crew of.... 5? And then they get hit by an impossibly dense asteroid shower not once, but twice? And they wait like what, 30 seconds, before they declare it's clear? Also: new FTL comms with Earth apparently. \n\nAnd then all the stupid tropes, like the not-pregnant-but-actually-pregnant girlfriend of the past who is also angry about her man spending too much time on his work, the disposable funny black lady who dies tragically, the unexpected pregnancy detected via an awfully convenient scan, the happy spacewalk song, the comms getting disabled right as they establish first contact, the chance encounter of a man dying on a plane (THE ARCTIC IS VAST LEGIT NOBODY LIVES HERE THIS SHIT DOES NOT HAPPEN) just in time to give him a mercy sendoff and more.\n\nUrg.

I understood a lot of things were done to keep the movie cinematic and drive the more important plot. I didn\u2019t go in with the expectation of a scientifically accurate sci-fi, so I wasn\u2019t really disappointed. \n\nThe shots were beautiful and the dialogue usually felt really genuine and impactful. Some of the flashback scenes felt pointless, but they weren\u2019t too intrusive.

They had those crazy translucent laptops, weird monkey VR game, and awkward ghost families on the holodeck (sidenote: VR family time with a recording seems like it would be lonelier than actually being alone). Why didn't the Arctic station have any of these amenities? The spaceship design also seemed really impractical.\n\n* What the fuck is wrong with young George Clooney? What kind of fucking sociopath works on his laptop at his desk while there's a 30 inch monitor on his desk? Can he not afford the right dongles for his macbook pro?\n\n* It was weird that most of the astronauts didn't sound American. Are they immigrants, or has American just invaded their home countries? If Iris claimed American citizenship via jus sanguinis, should she know her dad's name?\n\n* How does the ship just randomly go off course, and why don't the astronauts seem more concerned about it? Space ships don't just randomly drift away. Newton's first law and all that. The astronauts should be shitting their pants that something (like maybe an air leak) is imparting thrust onto their spaceship. The brief sub-plot about how they didn't know where they were also bugged me. If the fucking Apollo lunar module was able to use sensors + dead reckoning to track its location, why can't spaceships in the 2040s do the same thing? Even George Clooney knows that you can use stars to help determine your location and attitude, so why didn't they install a star tracker on the space ship? It already has cameras!!!\n\n* When they finally hear satellite signals, how do they know that the satellites are \"dying\"? Did Maya (or maybe it was Iris? I've forgotten) already know that Earth was fucked and she just forgot to tell the team?\n\n* Somehow they're close enough to Earth that there's no more than a second or two of delay. So Aether was probably closer to Earth than the moon for the entire movie!\n\n* Doing karaoke during an EVA seems unprofessional and dangerous. On top of blocking the radios, they also left the worst spacewalker behind to fend for herself. Kind of dumb all around, especially with the speech earlier about how they were professionals who wouldn't let their emotions get the best of them.\n\n* Ok, so apparently when they got close to Earth the guys were able to download the prerecorded messages from their families? Why the fuck didn't NASA record them a quick message with any sort of useful information?\n\n* The ending bugged the shit out of me. Ade and Ivy spend like 20 minutes talking to Clooney and everything is fine. Then, when \"the plot\" is over a computer beeps once and they just spend 5 minutes mindlessly pushing buttons. Then Ade has to get up and push buttons on another touchscreen for some reason while Ivy pushes buttons on both screens. What the fuck are they doing? Their inputs clearly don't require any thought; it's not like they're doing orbital mechanics calculations. Why isn't this automated?

That's not even going into the absurdity of how they glance over the fact that such a journey would [nearly take 8 years one-way](https://www.universetoday.com/128259/long-take-get-jupiter/).\n\nThe movie acts like Jupiter is so far away that communication would be impossible, even tho radio waves only need like 45 minutes from there to Earth. Them discovering a totally habitable planet would have been massive news, triggering global programs to get colony ships going there off the dying Earth, for which they would have had years in time. A colony ship gets a fleeting mention, but never an explanation as to what happened to it.\n\nI guess in that context it's very fitting how the movie ends on the notion that two people would be enough to kickstart humanity on another planet from pretty much nothing: Adam and Eve in space, whoever needs genetic diversity when one can land on Apocalypto Earth based on the slight hope to find whatever remains from one's family, to die together with them?\n\nIt's just weird how the movie tries to spin an ending like that in some kind of positive message of \"humanity will preserve\" when anybody with even a bit of common sense will instantly recognize the Bible-like logic behind it and how in reality that would have been the death sentence for the human species.", "If the girl was a figment, why did he get on the radio & try to let other people know she\u2019d been left behind?

The latter especially made me think it was a scene that wasn't actually that interesting so they just threw a music track on and threw out the recorded dialogue.\n\n* Lucas Hedges' reaction to hearing Meryl Streep had a dream she talked to a dead person was... really over-the-top. Did the editor slot in the wrong take?\n\n* Loved pretty much every scene with Gemma Chan and Lucas Hedges in it together, especially their \"date\" scene. What a riot!", "I loved this.

Brilliant. \n\nAs for the movie, i though it was very good. Great flow, great twist at the end, excellent performances, except for some of Lucas Hedge\u2019s mannerisms (that laugh is awkward).

Perhaps there is another way of understanding the movie as a whole and, in particular, the end. I think the storytelling is quite sophisticated in its misdirection: hiding then revealing key information to the audience. If the stakes of the movie are ultimately about friends that drifted apart and are trying to connect, then I actually found the movie to be underwhelming as the movie waits and waits and waits for the showdown between Alice and Roberta, and then Alice dies immediately after. There's just a lot left unanswered about how they really felt, and what actually happened between them. The audience has information enough to make educated guesses, but we get no definitive information.\n\nBut! There's so much unexplained. The beehive vision. The overly large music swell on Tyler at the end. What Alice wrote in her diary before she died. And the biggest 'unexplained' for me is when Susan and Roberta are playing scrabble, and Roberta remembers the 'fateful night' they were together and she told her life story to Alice. Susan is initially dismissive of the idea that Alice intentionally hurt Roberta, or even that the story was ever even based on Roberta's life at all. But then Susan starts to tell a story about her own memory of that night, about leaving their party to go spend time with a bartender. Curiously, her story gets cut just as she starts telling it (and just as she is spelling out BETRAY in the scrabble game) and we cut to Karen recounting a very similar story to Tyler, telling him he \"has to see the movie, it's great\".\n\nSo I think the implication is that there was another story made from the events of that fateful night, one that Tyler had never seen/heard of. The questions it opened were - who wrote that story? Certainly not Alice. Was there more to the story of that fateful night?\n\nPerhaps it's a bit of a stretch, but one answer seemed provided by the final scene with Susan and Krantz together. Just as the story hid the past relationship between Karen and Krantz, it's possible Krantz and Susan also knew each other prior to the boat trip. And with the subject of their mutual book being about poison, it seemed to imply that the movie is actually a murder mystery, similar to an Agatha Christie story or a Krantz novel. \"Who killed Alice?\"\n\nPossible motives for murder:\n\n\\- Karen's risk of failing to find more info on Alice is nullified if Alice dies\n\n\\- Tyler inherits a new life from Alice that positions him to get a woman like Karen (the movie makes a point of telling what kind of man Karen is interested in. It also gives Tyler a family backstory of criminals)\n\n\\- Susan may be protecting a secret about 'that fateful night' from Alice and Roberta?\n\nIf so, it seemed plausible to me that the big swell on Tyler at the end is not about how he realized Alice loved him as much as he did her.  Perhaps the 'big reveal' is that Tyler murdered her, and perhaps Susan (or more) were in on it, and they all got away with it. And so the big reveal of the doctor is actually a red herring - a false twist. \n\nIn the flashbacks between Tyler and Alice after her death, there is an implication there that Tyler had opportunity to poison her. \n\nEven with this theory, all of the pieces don't fit together perfectly for me. Trying to guess Susan's motives is a stretch, although it's about as much stretching as it takes to guess these character's motives without the murder/mystery theory. But the way the movie reveals itself so slowly and methodically plays, in retrospect, much more like a mystery than a drama.", "i really enjoyed it.  i am a fan of pretty much the entire cast so i just liked watching them interact.

The Goodfellowes especially make some, hmmm, questionable decisions that seem more tailored to drive the drama forward than to make sense, and their arcs aren't as elegant as the artwork - they come around on the whole \"being a pagan werewolf\" thing pretty dang fast.\n\nI wonder where Cartoon Saloon will go next, if there's still any more stories they can set in Ireland when they've already covered a lot of their mythologies.

I squirmed throughout.\n\nOf course LGBTQ rights are not a done deal in this country, and queer folk face all sorts of biases and forms of hatred. Still by 2018 (!) when the Broadway version of this film debuted, the crowd coming  to see a feel-good musical about a lesbian high school student didn't need convincing that love is love. Yet this movie over and over hammers at us as if it's teaching its audience something about tolerance.  Yet, they leave the lesbian relationship so under-developed, it wouldn't teach us anything if we needed to be taught it in the first place.\n\nSo it seemed to me not only smug and shallow, but also lazy and cynical...unless it was really operating at a meta level and we're supposed to be laughing at the movie itself. In fact, I would have like it more if it had been released as a parody film titled \"Broadway Musical.\" \n\nAside from that, I enjoyed Meryl Streep's confident hamminess, her amazing singing (it's not fair!), and Keegan-Michael Key's warmth, as well as the Broadway-quality dancing. But I thought the music was embarrassingly cliched  \u2014 like the filler songs in a Disney animated feature. Totally forgettable, although the lyrics were occasionally clever.\n\nAnd what a waste of talent!

Also bringing back the entire creative team of the show was so smart, so seeing the original choreography again was a delight. \n\nOne little thing: I was not at all surprised when the dropped the F bomb that was in the show to get a PG-13 rating (yes the MPAA allows it, but it was kinda unnecessary to begin with)", "I know teens can be assholes, but the reactions of the other classmates did really not rang true to me for 2020 \n\nthat whole mall scene with Andrew Rannells was bizarre", " I get that in the first part that they are narcissist assholes who thinks they are saving the world but how can you relate to Emma when the lyrics are somehow mocking her or diminishing her?

It was based on the true story of a school in Mississippi that tried to cancel their prom in order to prevent a same-gender couple from attending, which is *some bullshit*, so I just can't be bothered to care that this story is preaching to the choir.  I'm in the choir and I came for the sermon.  And the showtunes.  And yes it is extremely reductive to imply that the hearts and minds of an entire Indiana town could be changed by a four-minute banger sung by Andrew Rannells in the middle of a mall fountain, but I *want* to live in that world.  Everybody deserves a prom, and everybody deserves a little on-the-nose campy escapism.\n\nAs a movie musical, I thought it was a pretty solid adaptation.  Murphy's directing deserves a lot of credit for pulling off the dance numbers in particular.  The camera work combined with the set design really helped the dance numbers feel filled out in a way that movie musicals can really struggle with.  Over-produced vocals in movie musicals are usually a huge negative for me; I noticed it a little bit but overall it was an acceptable compromise for my taste.  It didn't go full Glee on the pop-ification of the musical numbers, which I appreciate.\n\nI thought the cast was really solid; the two leads were adorable, and the cast of Broadway celebrities really got to ham it up and have fun.  Watching Meryl Streep chew scenery will never not be enjoyable to me.  I didn't realize there was a hole in my life that would be filled with Nichole Kidman doing a Fosse number to teach a baby lesbian life lessons.  I know some people dislike James Corden but I thought he did fine.  Not amazing, but I'm glad they at least got someone who could sing IRL instead of trying to fill the role with someone who has more fame than vocal talent.  It would have been nice to have a gay actor play that role, but Corden shouldn't be blamed for playing a character who is meant to be a stereotype stereotypically.  There's lots of diversity within the gay community--some people *do* act in a more stereotypical, flamboyant way and that's okay.  Barry's more stereotypical behavior wasn't just the butt of all of the jokes; he was still a character who had an arc and who we were meant to sympathize with, which I think is an important distinction.", "Potentially unpopular opinion but i absolutely loved this movie and the music", "This was really bad.\n\nNicole Kidman's character was irrelevant, James Corden was terrible (as expected) and the script/dialogue was terribly written and clich\u00e9.\n\nThe only highlight was Meryl Streep, even though her character was not a great one.", "I cried about 6 times", "Too much Meryl and James, not enough Alyssa and Emma.

And its heart is very much in the right place, so it's a movie you WANT to like.\n\nBut good lord! Unmotivated camera angles, a sterile visual look in general, awkward tonal shifts, clunky cuts, ugly colour/lighting schemes, weird lens choice (distortion all over the place), pacing issues, sound mixing that fails to be immersive at all, etc. etc. etc. You can see all the effort that went into all the moving parts but a good director is supposed to pull all of these things together and create a smooth viewing experience and this movie feels so cobbled together and sloppy!\n\nIt's like Murphy has an idea of what style is but has trouble actually, like, *having* some. I'll admit I've seen almost none of his work so I don't mean that as a generalization but jeez, the direction in this really stood out as weak to me. A surer hand behind the camera (like a Rob Marshall type?) would have made a huge difference here.", "As someone who has seen (and loved) The Prom on Broadway. I think that, for the most part, this is a fine adaptation that has some really nice moments. \n\nHowever, it also has some major issues. \n\n In my mind, it does not matter whether James Corden was good or bad in his performance, the issue is his casting in the first place. This is a film that is ENTIRELY about inclusivity, casting a straight man to play an incredibly camp, over the top, gay character, makes the messaging of the movie feel disingenuous.\n\nMy single biggest issue with the movie however is the performance of \"Unruly Heart\". The entire movie/show is building up to this performance, it's Emma finally finding her way to deal with the hatred that she receives: from her classmates; from the community; from her parents. And it's meant to be a stark contrast to every intervention that the characters have made prior, where \"It's Not about Me\", \"The Acceptance Song\" or \"Tonight Belongs to You\" are big, flashy highly choreographed numbers, \"Unruly Heart\" is meant to be small and intimate, separate from the influence of the Broadway stars entirely. \n\nJust a girl baring her soul online and connecting with millions of people by being real.\n\nSO WHY DID THEY CUT HALF THE SONG!?\n\nWhy is Emma's bedroom spinning? Why is the camera spinning? Why aren't we experiencing it the way that the YouTube viewers are, Jo Ellen Pellman was great, just allow her to emote and sing the song for three minutes. \n\nBig positives:\n\nAndrew Rannells rules, put him in more stuff, \"Love Thy Neighbor\" is the most fun scene to watch. \n\nJo Ellen Pellman is straight up fantastic, her voice is really strong and she makes Emma an incredibly likable character.  \n\nThe secondary cast: Kerry Washington and Keegan Michael Key especially are very good. \n\nThe music remains fantastic. \n\nI spent a lot time thinking about this movie, I guess I'd give it a 6.5/10, and recommend it to anyone that enjoys musicals or just wants to enjoy what is, for the most part, quite a fun movie.", "After thinking on the film after watching it last night, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a solid 6/10. Not amazing, but average \u201cfeel-good\u201d content.\n\nStreep killed it as Dee Dee while the rest of the main leads did a decent job with the material they were given (which definitely felt like a lot less). It\u2019s a bummer Kidman got saddled with a boring song though. It\u2019s like her first musical since Moulin Rogue so I wanted to hear her sing more. The actress who played Emma was good for it being her first film.\n\nThat said, the story really felt like it zoomed though a ton of major plot points but didn\u2019t feel like it gave the audience time to feel those emotional beats. Also, I\u2019ve never seen the show but it would have been nice had the mean girls stayed mean. \n\nMusic wise, the songs were pretty forgettable except \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Dance\u201d.\n\nSo overall, it\u2019s average \u201cwholesome\u201d content with forgettable songs and a plot that you can call all the major plot points a mile away. But it\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s just not good either.\n\nIt\u2019s forgettable.", "It was certainly enjoyable to a point, but I found the entire endeavor extremely condescending and patronizing. If you're going to tell a story about the merits of tolerance and proceed to insult everyone who isn't as progressive as you you're going to come off as a smug, self-satisfied asshole. Meryl Streep was great (no surprises there) but the fact that she got more screen time than the girl that the movie was actually about - ESPECIALLY after singing that \"it's not about me\" song - seemed like a total lack of self-awareness. They started off pretty strong with the whole \"these actors are narcissists\" trope but about a third to half of the way through it's like they gave up. I don't know what I was expecting from a Ryan Murphy film, but even the fact that he made it didn't stop me being unimpressed by it.", "It seems to be universally hated by both critics and fans alike for a couple of key things: James Corden's horrific \"gayface\" performance and how cheesy it is overall. I admit that it's super cheesy, but I liked it! I'm a sucker for Broadway though and already liked these songs so maybe I'm biased. The only critique I really have is that everyone keeps saying how Jo Ellen Pellman is the breakout star from the project and I thought her acting was beyond terrible. she never stops smiling ear-to-ear. Ever. It's hard to convey sincere emotion like that even if you're supposed to be playing a scene that's happy, but when she's supposed to be acting heartbroken, sad, scared, anxious, embarrassed, etc., and she can't stop her comically large beaming, it becomes super distracting. She's a terrible actress. I get hot how this was her first project, but wow. Can't believe people like her! Am I the only one who couldn't get past her 3rd grade level acting chops??", "Not a good movie, but a fun colorful one that you can turn your brain off to watch.

Also, this movie could tone down the cheesiness of the dialogue for a bit.\n\nBut, I really like the ending and I thought it was satisfying, in this movie, I think it asked us the audience to re-think the concept of \"happily ever after\" and the fairy tales itself learn something from real-life. I think I can take a Lesson that day-to-day happiness as very important and it come with all sizes and shapes.\n\nAs a man, in the end, I enjoyed this, but at the same time I can see that parents that have younger child probably will enjoyed it more.

Mack was 10 when she wrote a letter to ask the Motherland for help - why has no kid written since? How did her letter get delivered? Both of Mack's daughters were familiar with the idea of a fairy godmother when Eleanor showed up, so it's not like kids forgot about fairy tales. They should have played it as \"Oh, everyone writes to Santa instead\" if they really wanted to explain why the Motherland was failing while also tying this movie at Christmas.\n\nThat said, I did enjoy the closing message of defining your own happy rather than pursuing someone else's impossible \"happily ever after\".", "I can\u2019t get over the weird Always Sunny reunion with both the Waitress and Artemis as supporting characters.", "I thought it was pretty cute and my son greatly enjoyed it.

A mashup somewhere between Enchanted and Elf that isn't half as good as either. Don't get me wrong, it's not a complete waste of time. It has it's cute moments but overall it is just really forced.\n\nIt was kind of weird this was a Christmas movie, right? Like, what do fairy godmothers and fairy tales really have to do with Christmas? It feels like you could connect them through the magical aspect but this movie didn't at all. It was just like, hey fairy godmothers exist and also it's Christmas. Christmas magic played no part in this movie, and even at the end during the \"Christmas parade\" the big song number wasn't even close to a Christmas song. Just seemed like a weird mashup that didn't fit at all.\n\nElf is a great movie, and it's the obvious comparison. Someone raised in a mystical place being a fish out of water in the modern day East Coast trying to bring happiness back into a cynic. But the world of Elf is so much more than just references, whereas this movie consists of fairy tale references but the reality of Godmother land just seems to be this one school where 60 year old women learn a trade that no longer exists for, seemingly, eternity. It just doesn't make any sense or create a very big world for us to learn about. There's a rushed plot about the school closing and she has to prove the worth of fairies again, but Moira is supposed to be this ticking clock villain despite her having no real reason to be that and is eventually convinced of the opposite through probably the most trite climax speech about love I've ever seen. \n\nPerformances were okay, honestly. They had a really good cast here and it's a shame Jillian Bell was so stuck to the wide-eyed innocent thing because she's so much funnier than this. The little girl with the performance anxiety was really the only reason I kept watching, she was a solid actress. Everything else though; the dead husband and new gentleman caller, the job drama, it all felt very tacked on. Like they knew these are things the movie needed but took no time to make them stand out or even mix them together with the main plot very well. \n\nOverall, I will probably not watch this again. And it's a shame that Disney has this streaming platform to release family and holiday movies like this that would go perfect with some cocoa and a blanket yet this and Noelle is what we're getting. Cheap Elf knockoffs.

When watching this movie we are not expected to ask such questions as *\"Why are the fairy godmothers unaware of the advances of technology?\"* or *\"How exactly does one apply to be a fairy godmother?\"* unfortunately, that kind of questioning bombarded me throughout this movie's interminable two-hour running time but experiences may vary. Isla Fisher was fine as the jaded woman who never got her \"Happily Ever After\" but the writers never really gave her anything more than a bunch of tired \"working woman\" cliches.\n\nOn the plus side, Gary the house-working raccoon was quite fun and the subplot of the eldest daughter's performance anxiety was rather sweet and not all the fish-out-of-water gags failed, sadly, the potential to be more was there it just wasn't utilized all that well.\n\nOverall, *Godmothered* could have been a fun satirically look at fairy tales but the script was more tired than inspired.

Jillian Bell was absolutely delightful as the fish out of water godmother named Eleanor. Trying to fulfill her destiny of making the dreams come true of an unbeknownst princess in the real world. Its message is solid but extremely formulaic, even by Disney\u00a0standards.\n\nIsla Fisher plays Mackenzie. Who is the person Eleanor goes to the real world to help give her the happily ever after that she wished for when she was 10. Eleanor is only 25 years late and Mackenzie is one husband and two kids deep already. She is a depressed angry at her job mother. Also known as an adult. Eleanor is here to help though and the ride is unexpectedly delightful. Last time I saw Isla Fisher she was sitting on Matthew McConaughey's face and getting dick downed by Snoop in the \"Beach Bum\" so this was quite the turn. Not that great of a performance by her but at least she's having\u00a0fun.\n\nThe side characters are my main issue with \"Godmothered\". Utkarsh Ambudkar plays Mackenzie's boss and is an over the top insufferable dick. Just really a bad guy for the sake of having one and he really doesn't do anything awful besides being a dumb boss.  \nJune Squibb plays a fairy godmother who doubles as Eleanors roommate. She bookends the movie through narrations and occasionally pops up throughout and is honestly insufferable. Not her fault. Her jokes are just terrible. There's also some bad CGI that really sticks\u00a0out.\n\nAs a kids movie, \"Godmothered\" is fine, but unfortunately won't cross the barrier as a universal crowd\u00a0pleaser.", "This movie had no business being almost 2 hours long.\n\nThat said I love Jillian Bell and June Squibb and they were fun in this.", "This makes me wonder what great Christmas movies have came out since Elf in 2003.

And in this case, that makes for some sort of elitist film (that\u2019s not a critique, just a statement of fact).\n\nThe movie is rigid to the point of becoming dull, except for a few sequences when it comes to life, usually relying on the impact of the dialogues, that are well-written and theatrical, but not strong enough to turn the film into an insightful character study. For instance: a lot is said about politics, but the script never addresses the roots of Mank\u2019s political ideology or, for that matter, any of his personality traits and relationships (or lack of). No wonder Amanda Seyfriend is being hailed as the MVP, since she\u2019s the only one that establishes some meaningful connection with Mank and adds a much needed humanity to his character.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s form over substance, and that\u2019s also true when it comes to Fincher\u2019s directorial choices (his attempt to replicate the aesthetics of the time eventually works against the movie, like the obvious script headings leading to flashbacks).

I guess his friend's death was suppose to be his rosebud but it was hard to care when the film spent no time with the character beforehand. \n\nAnd there was no climax, no drama about whether the film would be made or not.

I\u2019d bet most actors\u2019 instinct would be to drop the aloofness as time goes on, but Oldman lets you see him struggle to keep it up.\nMy only real complaint is the false artifacts inserted in the \u201cfilm\u201d.

Overall, favorite movie I\u2019ve watched this year so far.", "(Long-form thoughts!) I think *Mank* is a good movie, but it didn't feel like it was pushed to the Fincher Standard. There's a ton to like on a technical level. It was beautifully shot, the acting across the board was top-notch, and it was interesting to hear a Reznor/Ross score that reached way back instead of their usual sound. And even the script, though as meandering as a script can get, has some awesome dialogue.\n\nEven some of the history was nicely done. William Randolph Hearst would often seat the guests he found most intriguing nearest him and getting sat away was akin to being demoted. So to see Mank near the center at the beginning of the film, then off at the very edge at the end was a nice little show of just how far Mank had fallen.\n\nEverything else was a confusion of subplots vying for dominance. I kept mentally comparing *Mank* to *The Aviator* the entire time, which was also about a film auteur who fell from grace. I had never seen *Hell's Angels*, but Scorsese was able to integrate enough of the film and even show enough of its production to drive home why it was of personal importance to Hughes in context. Not just because of the subject matter, but there were real stakes if he failed.\n\n*Mank* takes a similar approach, but frequently gets distracted. Mank's relationship with Hearst is supposed to be the inciting incident for his agreement to take on *Citizen Kane*, but he's in all of two or three scenes with Hearst. We never really see a relationship build until it's already deteriorated. It's also supposed to be about him butting heads with Orson Welles, but we don't see this until literally the end of the third act.\n\nIt also tries to be about Mank's antagonistic relationship with the higher-ups at MGM, but we never see him *do anything*. That dovetails into the plotline involving Mayer and Upton Sinclair that honestly felt out of place in the grand scheme of things. I know it's supposed to help draw out Mank's commitment to principle over all else, but the cynical side of me felt like that entire plotline was there to allow for yet another instance of someone all but looking into the camera and making an uninteresting connection between Nazi Germany and modern politics. I understand the script was written years ago by Fincher's father, but there's just no way that particular point wasn't sharpened for Netflix.\n\nBut I think the biggest sin that the movie commits is that it has absolutely *no* interest in giving us any insight into the development of *Citizen Kane*. It doesn't show anything. It barely shows Orson. Their clash comes so late it's pretty much relegated to the epilogue. In that sense, a great deal of *Mank* feels like one of those low-budget unauthorized biopics, where they have absolutely no rights to the original film. We can't connect Mank to his own work, unlike how Scorsese was able to connect Hughes to *Hell's Angels*, *Scarface*, and even the construction of the *Hercules*. Mank gets drunk in the Mojave Desert and finishes the script off-screen.\n\n*Mank* pretty much feels like a companion piece to *Citizen Kane*, and that's kinda frustrating because it should be able to stand on its own. And it has so much to say about all sorts of things that never really coalesce, so it also doesn't feel like it even succeeds at being a good biography. Like, when the character that's barely in the movie talks about how Mank sponsored her entire German village to allow them entrance into the US. *Where was that stuff?* That sounds crazy and interesting, and really plays into Mank's commitment to principle better than the Sinclair stuff. It was a play against Nazi Germany but also, by extension, against MGM because they refused to stop showing films there--which was beyond problematic for Mank, being Jewish himself. But that's all pushed into a throw-away line by a character who had no other reason to be there but to deliver that line.\n\nSo as-is, *Mank* was great on a technical and acting level. But everything involving plot and character feel like afterthoughts. So we're left with an alcoholic protagonist who cheats on his wife and leaves her to fend for herself back in NY, and, after being slighted by no one in particular, decides to punch up at the establishment by writing a movie off-screen. I know this was a passion project for Fincher, so that's that, but I feel like there was such potential here for something more epic.", "It was a good summary of 2020 from the political mess of propaganda to the unemployed and struggling while the rich get richer.

When Mank ask Marion a favor to pull the propaganda film, what does she mean by \"already made her exit\" ?", "I thought the guy who player Mayer was fantastic", "Great on the technical and acting front, but I couldn\u2019t connect to a single character and struggled to finish this.\n\nLove Fincher\u2019s work, and I hope he\u2019s scratched his artsy itches, because I need that third season of Mindhunter. Wishful thinking, I know.", "This movie is rose colored glasses for old Hollywood and much like any sort of lense it magnifies an image and refracts it; showing all the scars and blemishes of a bygone era but much at the same time romanticizing it. Fincher has this modern way of looking at old but important movie with such new eyes, in a way that one would argue that it seems like history repeating itself. Some would possibly find the political message in the film to be exhausting especially with the modern climate but it's all to magnify the relationship of the main character whose riddled with vices and flaws but none more so than the burden of Wit. Which the main character and the screenwriting shares ten fold. The score and sound ripped straight from the aforementioned bygone era that I can't help but watch and marvel.\u00a0\n\n10/10 Fantastic and flawless in delivery and tone that I am remissed to give it a score any lower", "Honestly, well, maybe I'm dense, but I am having  big trouble following this movie. I think the dialogue is incredible but at the same time they seem to be saying a lot of nothing. And I can just barely follow what the hell is going on.", "Amanda Seyfried is so hot in this!\n\nSeems like a weird thing to mention, but every time she was on-screen she was magnetic.", "Man that score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was incredible", "The film has a monaural audio-track which sounds beautifully authentic, film-grain and cigarette marks that often look surprisingly genuine, and yet it was all shot digitally with 8K cameras, framed entirely in widescreen. There are some great performances throughout (even if they did fuck Orson over) but I can't get over how glossy some of those images looked, and CGI animals? Please... It's a pretty contradiction. Fincher is more concerned with being a digital technician than a filmmaker here. Hopefully he makes a return to form on his next one, although it's starting to seem like nothing will ever knock Zodiac off its throne.", "I already put some story analysis and deeper thoughts on Mank in a couple other comments in this thread but I wanted to come back and comment on Mank and its function as metatext. While I think Mank is an instant masterpiece I don\u2019t believe you must like it to fully appreciate what David Fincher has done with this movie. \n\nAfter first watching the movie I was struck by how many described this movie as about authorship, \u201cbattle for credit\u201d, over a masterwork of cinema. Mank is absolutely not about credit for Citizen Kane or addressing who the actual genius is, Welles or Mankiewicz, rather it is about the motivation for a story as subversive as Citizen Kane and how does something like that get made despite a system\u2014like the old Hollywood studio system\u2014that is designed to be mass production of entertainment for the \u201ccustomers\u201d as Mayer, in Mank, constantly refers to the audience. The studio system does not foster creativity or make room for individual expression, originality, and subversiveness, something like Citizen Kane. Two standout quotes from the Mayer character in Mank illuminate this point:\n\n>\tThis is a business where the buyer gets nothing for his money but a memory. What he bought still belongs to the man who sold it, that\u2019s the real magic of the movies\n\n***The Mayer character delivers that gem immediately before telling the cogs of his assembly line that he is cutting wages***\n\n>\tI\u2019m not interested in educating our customers, you want to send a message? Call Western Union\n\nThat type of mindset, that kind of business leaves no room for subversiveness or provocation or the creative expression seen in movies like Citizen Kane.\n\nWelles is not the antagonist of this movie. Mayer and Hearst, the Hollywood power brokers are the antagonists. The system is antagonistic to Mank and Welles. All of this is happening during the formation of the Guilds and the workers in Hollywood unionizing. \n\nThe flashbacks in Mank show what caused Mank to feel the guilt and responsibility and what he observed from within the system which served as motivation to write the story. Ultimately, it does not matter what creative percentages one assigns to Mankiewicz and Welles for the story of Citizen Kane, what matters is the kind of people it took to make it: creative, iconoclastic people willing to fight against the pressures of the system. \n\nMank is an original, personal movie about how original, personal movies get made despite the pressures, obstacles, finances, personal demons, and petty squabbles working against the creative process. \n\nOther metatextual elements of note:\n\n-\tThe line about not being able to sum up a person\u2019s life in two hours\n-\tFincher making this movie within the streaming service \u201csystem\u201d\n-\tThe filmmaking techniques used for Mank which mirror those of Citizen Kane\n-\tHollywood being the propaganda arm of political actors and power brokers\n-\tAnd of course Mank, which ends with Oscar victories, itself being a movie immediately referred to\u2014due to it checking all of the traditional boxes\u2014as Oscar bait while being about the sociopolitical issues in old Hollywood and labor disputes considering Louis B Mayer created the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in an attempt to squash the uprising of labor unions in Hollywood", "I was actually surprised by how much I loved this movie. And that's not to say I had any doubts in Fincher, it just didn't seem to me that a movie about the writer of Citizen Kane would be that riveting. Not knowing the story I was unsure where the movie was going at first, but as it unfolded in its jumbled way I came to love and appreciate everyone involved and, most importantly, their perspectives on each other. Mix that with that interesting political themes and some good old fashioned appreciation for classic cinema and I can't wait to watch this again.\n\nAmanda Seyfried was the standout here, I think. She absolutely killed her role as the curious and smart actress. Seen by many as locked in a castle to be a rich man's trophy wife when the truth is much more complex and loving than that. The way this movie paints certain characters by way of third party discussions then gives those characters a chance to defend themselves is not only brilliantly done, but in itself is an impressive homage to the whole idea of Citizen Kane. His wife, his brother, Charles Dance, even Mank himself are all portrayed or seen as something more shallow than they really are in this movie. It's a really fascinating movie about perspective and therefore it's about who gets to write that perspective. \n\nAs much time as I could spend talking about the ins and outs of the characters and the many amazing ways this movie paid tribute to one of the original greats, I could spend as much time talking about the camerawork, how this movie truly feels like it was made a century ago. Simple things like the shot we'd get any time a car was approaching the house he was writing CK in or even that insane montage of images during election night really sold the feel. This movie feels old in so many more ways than just the black and white, and when a movie feels genuinely old it suddenly feels original. It's so close to the feeling I got when I first watched Citizen Kane. The thought that, yeah, maybe none of these camera angles or this rags to riches story are new to me now, but that's only because everyone's spend a hundred years imitating it. Obviously this movie is brand new but I'm just in awe at how it not only paid homage to one of the greatest films of all time, but how it matched the beats and made me feel like I was watching it with new eyes all over again. \n\nI love a good Fincher film but I have to say, I think he has truly shown how incredible he is with this movie. I'm not sure everyone will love it as much as I did, but I think anyone with an interest in classic cinema will get a lot out of it. 9/10.", "I already wrote about my thoughts on the film, but I just have to say that as a fan of classic Hollywood, I love the little stories and myths they put in:\n\n* Mank really did send that note, but it was to Ben Hecht.\n\n* Love the little cameos. The guy who hets called \u201cbanjo eyes\u201d in the writer\u2019s room is supposed to be Eddie Cantor. Charlie Chaplin is the guy at the piano during one of Hearst\u2019s dinners. \n\n* Louis B. Mayer was known to a bit of actor himself. As portrayed during Thalberg\u2019s funeral, Mayer had the ability to basically cry on demand and did.\n\n* Speaking of Mayer, the scene when he tells the staff that they are getting pay cuts really happened.\n\n* Mank really said the line about how the \u201cwhite wine came up with the fish,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t at one of Hearst\u2019s dinners.\n\n* Mank did sponsor German refugees, some Jewish, but not a whole village. Also while the anti-Sinclair reels are real, the character os Metcalf is not and has no real life analogue. Finally, Mank wasn\u2019t as liberal as he was portrayed in the film. Due to the horrors he saw serving in WWI, he was an isolationist. His friends joked he was \u201cright of Lindbergh.\u201d However, when reports started coming out regarding the discrimination facing Jews in Germany some of his friends wondered if he felt anything regarding  the plight of his fellow community. Mank wrote The Mad Dog of Europe in response to the Nazis and, when Pearl Harbor happened, tried to reenlist.", "I feel stupid but did they call Mank's wife \"Poor Sara\" for financial reasons or simply because they felt bad for her because Mank was so selfish and drowning in alcohol?", "I loved Arliss Howard as Louis B. Mayer. He stole every scene he was in. Hope he get at least an Oscar nomination.", "All the characters were boring and what is a movie without characters?", "Most of this film is really quite good, which is why it sucks so much that the Finchers had to end with ahistorical nonsense propping up Pauline Kael's long-debunked essay Raising Kane that continues to demean Welles even after death.", "Good movie, but I guess I shouldn't have gone in to it expecting to see the filming of Citizen Kane. More of a sociopolitical drama.", "I kinda loved it but I admit it works much better for those who have seen Citizen Kane and know about 1940s Hollywood. It throws you in the mix with very little context or explanation, seems more interested in offering parallels with 2020. But it works. Oldman is terrific. \n\nAlso, and I could be wrong, but I felt casting a 61-year Oldman as a mid-40s Mankiewicz was intentional? Mank looked way older than he appeared in real life so rather than putting an aging up someone else, just get Gary Oldman. I\u2019ve seen some people complain about this but I do think that was the point on Fincher\u2019s end.", "So excited it\u2019s finally out for everyone to see it. This is one of my top films of the year.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to praise from the breathtaking score and production design, to the acting and just how fucking funny this film is. \n\nSome quick thoughts.\n\nAmanda Seyfried was a powerhouse in this movie and deserves all the love she\u2019s been getting. The film is far more critical to old Hollywood and the shitty people that ran it, then I initially thought. Additionally the effort put into making it look like the film was just rediscovered after 70 years is insane.", "\"Enter Menace\"\n\nThe scene of Orson Welles visiting Mank in the hospital was so sinister and grim it made me chuckle. \n\nThe exercise of technicality is beautiful to behold. I keep revisiting scenes for how meticulous they are.\nFincher is a master.", "Need some help on this. I understand that there is no actual acceptance speech from Mank in real life, but a friend and I are in disagreement about whether the final scene is real in the context of the film; given that Mank says \u201cif I could\u2019ve given a speech\u201d or something to that effect, and the general tongue in cheek nature of his response (not to mention the harrowing ending of \u201cHe was 55.\u201d), I took that scene as an imagined scenario\u2014 the last word that Mank never gets to have. My friend disagrees and says (at least within the world of the film) the speech is actually happening. Any thoughts on this? It felt imagined/like a projection to me.", "My favourite scene was the first dinner party, the one with Charlie Chaplin at the piano. The back-and-forth argument about politics was perfectly directed.\n\nThe first half of the movie was well constructed, I was surprised that only an hour had passed. The second half was very messy, it was clear that the script had been reworked so that the narrative reflected the 2016 presidential election. Mank becoming Hollywood Bernie Sanders felt like a stretch of reality.", "Really wish both Fincher's took some lessons from Citizen Kane and focused on a small set of characters rather than going so wide and broad early on. Its only when the movie shrunk its scope to Mank,Meyer,Hearst and Marion did it truly start to sing but the intital sections were overstuffed and bloated. Did it need the Selznick pitch meeting at all?", "I was really looking forward to this, and I'm happy to say that Fincher delivered. Mank, the character, was as clever and gregarious as I hoped he would be. I only had a cursory knowledge of the making of Citizen Kane, but was always fascinated by Mankiewicz. I never understood why he bit the hand that fed him. This story at least offers a clue. \n\nI don't know how true to life the Upton Sinclair story is, but for those who take it to heart, it's a great wakeup call to how manipulated and manufactured our emotions are not just for our politics and beliefs, but what we like to eat and buy and feel. But that thread seems to be dropped before it threatens to wake up too many of the unwashed masses.\n\nI was intrigued by the classic look Fincher mimicked for the cinematography, but found the fake \"cigarette burns\" in the top right a bit overdone. Almost like he was using them as punctuation or to make a subliminal point. I could have done with 3 instead of the dozen or more that we got throughout. But that's really my only criticism. \n\nThe film was a gem and left me feeling both happy and nostalgic. Especially when Welles calls Mank an alcoholic, when we know that's what Welles himself becomes. And the scene where Mank blows up his relationship with Hearst, where Dance, as Hearst, looks at Mank as if wanting to hear what he has to say, knowing that it's true, and letting him finish, while knowing that this is the last time he'll let him inside the sanctum. I also liked the last time Davies and Mank met, when Davies doesn't hold her portrayal against him, while also saying that she'll fight to shelve the film.\n\nIt had the feel of a true story, with enough artistic license to make it enjoyable. A great tribute by Fincher to his father.\n\n\"I'm 43, but that's very understanding.\" Says a 61 year old Gary Oldman. At that time Mank would have been 43, though, which I thought was funny.", "I was expecting to like this film much more, considering:\n\n* I am a HUGE Fincher fan\n* I am a HUGE Gary Oldman fan\n* Have a lot of respect for *Citizen Kane*\n* I love the Hearst lore and have visited the San Simeon \"castle\" 3 times\n* I am a sucker for industry films\n\nIn the end, I was entertained but not blown away. I did love the old movie stylizing and the technical aspects to deliver the experience. I also appreciated the inclusion of the two younger female characters who weren't dopes.\n\nUsually with Fincher's films, I'm riveted until the end. I wasn't so drawn into *Mank*. The Hearst character was such a stock villain. It felt like there needed to be a couple of scenes with Mank & Hearst bonding like 2 people, so that the betrayal/dissolvement of their relationship had more weight. An intimate scene with Seyfried & Dance would have been cool too. I don't mean a love scene per se, but just something without all the partygoers.", "I knew the movoe was going to favour Ksel's version of things but I do find it extremely odd that this movie's central conflict and thrust is about the Hollywood propaganda machine when the movoe is itself clearly adhering to a debunked and highly disingenuous version of history. \n\nNot sure if the irony is intentional or David is on the Kael bandwagon himself", "I find this movie to be one of the greatest 'old Hollywood' commentary pieces and can be immensely enjoyed if the viewer has some context about the politics of what is going on at the time. someone who has studied history of Hollywood is going to follow this much better than some one like me who has limited knowledge. This being said I really enjoyed it despite my lack of context.", "To be perfectly honest, I did not enjoy it. Great production, great feel, acting, all that on point - and while Mank is/was an entertaining character, nothing in the plot really stood out or made a strong impression on me. It felt more like an overlong vignette that is interesting for a few minutes but then just drops off.", "Did Eric Roth do some rewrites on this? It's nice David's dad got sole credit, but when I saw Roth's name as a producer I wondered.\n\nEnjoyed it overall quite a bit. One of my favorites this year, but one I can't really recommend to my casual friends. But it's not made for them. That's why it's great that it's on Netflix, I think. (And hopefully a Criterion blu-ray next year) An admiration for the era is recommended for full enjoyment. Still would have loved to see it on the big screen.", "As meh movies go this is one of the better ones.", "I'm a bit taken aback by all the negative comments about the story in this thread actually. I thought everything came together really well. Maybe the Citizen Kane story structure is dated or maybe people were expecting a bigger plot twist. I thought it was a fun character piece.\n\nMank is so self assured and so apathetic for so many years. Dude knows how slimy and corrupt Hollywood is but stays quiet. Keeps his ideals drowned in booze, shit talks people but doesn't actually do anything. Instead of Kane losing his ideals it's Mank starting to act on his idealism.\n\nWas the movie factually accurate? Of course not. How many scripts get made without any rewrites? Even Mank was adding to the script at the last minute. But that's such an afterthought to the story Fincher was telling.", "I've not seen a movie waste so many characters by actually casting them but spending the runtime just discussing them instead. Especially at the end when Mank is roasting Hearst and Mayer it doesn't have quite the punch it should have.", "Mank as played by Oldman seems extreme insufferable and the kind of pretentious asshat who ruins everybody's vibes at the party by being miserable and self righteous. Really sympathized with Sara here but I'm not sure how much of this is on purpose. I should be enjoying seeing Mank stick it to Hearst and the cronies but I was hoping somebody smacked him and kicked him out.", "Why is everyone saying \"I had no faith in Amanda Seyfried but she genuinely surprised me and was the best!\" when she's given several great performances? \n\nAnyway, love Fincher, the cast, the aesthetic, but have total lack of interest in the content. I'll still start it this weekend but.. eh.", "In an alternate timeline, they got another season of Mindhunter instead of this.", "Since they call Hearst \u201cPops,\u201d I thought it was Marion\u2019s father at first. \n\nThe film has a lot of moving parts, and there are parts that I love. The GOP election sequence is a masterclass of directing. \n\nIt has one flaw, and that it\u2019s just filled with *stuff*. Lots of moving parts make the first half very complicated to follow. Especially keeping track of his screenwriting friends. But as it moves on, it\u2019s one of the films that gets better and better as it goes on. \n\nGrade: unknown.", "I really enjoyed it but it really felt quite niche. Knowing the back story behind it, it really comes off as a passion project.\n\nA lot of Fincher's filmography feels transcendent and vital (Se7en, Zodiac, the Social Network). While I really enjoyed this, I can't say the same of Mank.\n\nI would really only recommend this to put who are big into movie culture and Old Hollywood. Not really for a general audience", "I thought the movie was just ok. The performances were good but nothing ever stood out to me.", "Watching this I realized that, in the past, when I\u2019ve viewed Fincher movies, I mistakenly assume he\u2019s also the writer. Save for Social Network, which is so obviously Sorkin.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s a credit to his distinct style he\u2019s crafted over the last 20-25 years. Typically, you know when you\u2019re watching Fincher film. And, his familiar presence behind the lens just sort of washes over everything. This is Fincher Movie. It\u2019s all his creation. His fingerprints are everywhere\n\nMank is the first time as a heavyweight, I think he took a step back and allows the script and story to dictate his direction, instead of oversaturating it with his style.\n\nAnd this movie is all the better for it. \n\nThis story is clearly important to him. And to best tell that story, he knew he had to set aside ego, choose substance over his style, and get the hell out of the way.\n\nIn many ways, this is most personal movie. It\u2019s him at his most restrained and mature. And his best film in a long while.", "My Mank review: \"First time in 30 years I fell asleep watching a David Fincher movie.\"", "Thought this quote was interesting from Fincher on Welles:\n\nWhile Fincher is quick to applaud Welles for the clear talent the filmmaker had, the \u201cMank\u201d director believes that Welles \u201cwas above all a showman and a juggler with this immense talent.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, I think Orson Welles\u2019s tragedy lies in the mix between monumental talent and filthy immaturity,\u201d explained Fincher. \u201cSure, there is genius in \u2018Citizen Kane,\u2019 who could argue? But when Welles says, \u2018It only takes an afternoon to learn everything there is to know about cinematography,\u2019 pfff\u2026 Let\u2019s say that this is the remark of someone who has been lucky to have Gregg Toland around him to prepare the next shot\u2026 Gregg Toland, damn it, an insane genius!\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI say that without wanting to be disrespectful to Welles, I know what I owe him, like I know what I owe Alfred Hitchcock, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, or Hal Ashby. But at 25, you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. Period. Neither Welles, nor anyone. It doesn\u2019t take anything away from him, and especially not his place in the pantheon of those who have influenced entire generations of filmmakers. But to claim that Orson Welles came out of nowhere to make \u2018Citizen Kane\u2019 and that the rest of his filmography was ruined by the interventions of ill-intentioned people, it\u2019s not serious, and it is underestimating the disastrous impact of his own delusional hubris.\u201d", "I really wanted to like this but I don't think I can give it more than a 6/10.\n\nActing, especially from Oldman, was superb, although a lot of the supporting actors didn't really have much to do. The overall production quality was great. Some beautiful art direction going on and there were some specific scenes that I loved.\n\nBut... as a whole I found it hard to connect with either the characters or the story being told. Oldman as Mank is well acted, but we've seen the alcoholic, self-destructive writer trope before and I didn't feel like there was a lot new here. Most of the side characters beyond Mank (and there were certainly quite a few) appeared and disappeared almost at random, never really making much of an impact. The film seemed to act as though the viewer should intrinsically feel some kind of emotional attachment to these people (or at least feel as though they are *important*) but mostly never gives us any reason to do so. At times I felt like I was watching some kind of inside joke from the outside, like maybe all of this would click to people who had spent a lifetime working in the Hollywood system. Maybe so, but to me it mostly fell cold.\n\nI understand why he made it, but to me this is Fincher's weakest film.", "Gary Oldham is a terrific actor, but he is wasted here in the listless and disappointing **MANK**, an earnest but overwrought film that cannot overcome a weak script that lacks in both story and character.\n\nLack of context here is a fatal flaw. What are the stakes?! The film offers no reasons as to why we're supposed to care if **CITIZEN KANE** gets made, or how it got made, or any of the rest of it. Why did it matter to Mankiewitz? Or Orson Wells for that matter?! There was literally no reason for me to care about Mank at all, or anyone else in the entire film.\n\nOh, and let's not forget the film's ham fisted politics... the \"Socialism Good\" & \"Republicans Bad\" tropes and clich\u00e9s that are so on the nose, repetitive, and heavy handed as to be groan inducing.\n\nThumbs down from me, Gene.", "Very stiff re-telling. I expected a lot more.", "Thought this had a lot of clever and memorable dialogue... but as a film overall was sort of bad.\n\nI just never got much of a sense of why this is a story that needed to be told. For what it has to say about Hearst you might as well just watch Citizen Kane, and Mank\u2019s own story is so low-stakes and meandering I\u2019m not really sure what I was expected to take from it. It doesn\u2019t wring much drama out of the situation at all, so a lot of verbose, literate dialogue is pretty much all I\u2019m left with.\n\nSounds mean but I have to wonder if Fincher would\u2019ve been so eager to make this had his own dad not written it.", "Everything is good except the story itself.\n\nC+ recommendation for movie nerds\n\nNot recommended for general audiences, they will be bored to tears.", "What a let down", "I started watching it when it came out and only watched half of it and finished it yesterday, just didn't keep my interest. I thought it looked great but didn't really get any emotional connection till the final 5 or so minutes, don't know why. Liked the second half more than the first tho.", "I really, really wish this had been shot on film. The visuals weren't quite doing it for me, it just looked like so much like digital footage with a b&w filter on it. Granted this may have been since I was watching at home on my tiny tv, but it just didn't look at all like film to me. There were some moments when the visuals did work, like the election-night montage, and when they worked, they really worked, but those moments just made the rest of the film feel disappointing by comparison since it wasn't consistent.", "HBO made a movie about Citizen Kane in 1999 called RKO 281, and it's a much better film.\n\nHere's a link https://youtu.be/eo3ajCJNwU8", "Gary Oldman is good.

Could never last more than 20 minutes, until I lost interest completely. Probably the only Fincher film I'd call 'dull', even Benjamin Button was at least visually interesting. I just really hated the faux-vintage, but totally digital, aesthetics. Seyfried was the only person I found interesting. Oh well.", "Suprised at the reaction a bit here. I was really impressed with this one and was engrossed for the whole time. I do understand how you could not like it, if you didnt connect with Mank and his principles, since there is little in urgency and stakes throughout it, but I suppose I was just swept up in the era, snappy dialogue, and politics of the society and movies. \nHaven't seen Citizen Kane for reference, but liked this Fincher significanty more than Girl with Dragon Tattoo, which I saw the other night.", "I love Fincher but this movie wasn't for me. Maybe because I have't seen Citizen Kane, I wasn't invested at all.\n\nThey throw so many names and characters at you without any explanation who they are and why they're important, I had to stop and google who they were and how they're related to the story every 10 minutes.\n\nI understand why Fincher made this and how special the movie is for him, but I feel it was made for movie critics and people who know the history of Hollywood.\n\nLoved how charismatic Gary Oldman was but that's all.\nI thought the movie would be a engaging biography piece at least.", "I thought it was terrible, boring and self-indulgent, I now understand why the movie hasn't been made for 30 years. Fincher is my favourite director of all time, I've read Kael's essay and rewatched CK in preparation for this but was left incredibly disappointed. Oldman and Seyfried are great, cinematography is impressive but the story was flat and confusing. I see this as Fincher's pet project, hope he's now done with it and can move on to directing something for an audience rather than himself.", "It didn't wow me, and I'm a Fincher fan who has by pure coincidence just watched Citizen Kane recently. Mank is a compelling character and he has some great dialogue, but they failed to achieve the very thing they seem to laud Citizen Kane for (taking a bunch of disparate moments in a man's life and assembling them into a cohesive whole). Citizen Kane has a pretty clear message about power, ambition, and innocence. What is the point of Mank? I think that's a lot harder to say. \n\nIt works as a character study of a sad, but talented man (the monkey parable) and there's obviously a lot of affection for old Hollywood baked into this, but is it a great movie that I can recommend to anyone? Not really. It's a B- to me. Worthwhile, but not something the average person will love and not something I can recommend without reservation.", "Wanted to like this but could not get into it at all. In the end, it's about one man's obsession with recreating a cinematic era's look and style, failing to realise that digital inherently fails to sincerely mimic said era, and then forgetting to make an interesting film that goes along with it. I feel like the flashback structure, while referencing Kane, directly hampers the trajectory of the story, as we never really *feel* Mank's descent into despair -- we're just shown it, interrupted, shown it, etc. The whole thing just feels so flat.", "The acting and cinematography were great but Jack Fincher\u2019s script was a bit over the top.  David should have had somebody to a major rewrite of his late dad\u2019s script.  Amanda Seyfried was great and I will be rooting for her on Oscar night.", "I would actually love to see a more focused movie on the Sinclair race. It was for me the most interesting and at the same time disheartening part of the movie.", "I would have liked to have seen a LOT more of what made Mankiewicz brilliant. The mind that wrote the script for \"Citizen Kane\" was incredibly incisive. It didn't show in \"Mank\" though: mostly Mank was just a drunk who rambled a lot and an idiot gambler. I didn't like the person at all, and there just wasn't enough of his brilliance shown to redeem him. I'm sorry I wasted time on this film.", "This movie was boring.

You didn\u2019t understand the movie better than anyone else, so quit navel gazing.", "overdone dialogue that the characters laugh at more than we ever do. An overdone Welles when he's not just being the expository end of an old fashioned phone. Lily Collins who does her best with what she has, which is a dead/not-dead husband. The attempt to make it look old with simulated imperfections in the upper right hand corner in the same 3 places. Oldman overacting it. And that god awful trentz reznor soundtrack. That was just 'hey it's the same song just slightly different'. \n\nWatched CK right before this. Jesus what a bad omage to one of the all time greats. \n\nHaven't seen Aliens 3 but Fincher's worst work otherwise.", "Not saying Mank was bad but it's probably the second worst movie David Fincher has ever done.", "It felt like you are not supposed to enjoy the movie unless you are capable of real time understanding of all the references, time jumps, dialogue, characters that randomly interact with the protagonist and sarcastic/clever-ish dialogue. Too pretentious for my taste. Only works if the spectator is capable of filling all the gaps and bears with it untill a gullible ending.", "The montage at the GOP party was stunning, what an amazing sequence. My knowledge about the politics and whatnot of Mank were minimal to say the least, but I loved it. Gary Oldman was incredible and he thoroughly deserves his inevitable Oscar nomination. I get this movie isn't for everyone but this is peak Fincher in my opinion. A beautifully made film with gorgeous cinematography and top notch performances.", "I\u2019ve always been of a fan of Fincher\u2019s scripts, lighting, cinematography, soundtrack, editing, and every other aspect that adds to the overall tone of the movie. The Social Network is in my top 5 movies of all time, for this reason \n\nBut with Mank, nothing really seemed to hit the mark for me. Story...eh. Soundtrack...eh. Cinematography...weirdly digital, and kind of a joke at times, with the cigarette burns and such.\n\nI\u2019m the biggest fan of slow burners there is, but this film was a little too self indulgent for me. 3/10", "My review (taken from my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/lyingtxyou/)):\n\nDavid Fincher\u2019s Mank is an exceptional film from a technical standpoint; the cinematography and sound design particularly standout with the film looking and sounding straight out of the 1940s (not sure about those fake cigarette burns though) and the score also being a massive highlight with Atticus and Ross\u2019 work sounding incredibly authentic.\n\nFincher\u2019s directing talent really shines in the performances with every doing a really fantastic job at playing their characters, however, they never feel like real people and that\u2019s down to the script.\n\nThe writing and script was the weakest part of the film for me and I found myself unable to really become properly engaged with the film due to it. I feel that the filmmakers chose to focus on the least interesting part of the writing process of Citizen Kane, however, I do understand why they would focus on the fake news aspect as it\u2019s relevant to our society today. Knowing some of the stories and history of the writing process I just couldn\u2019t help but think how much more engaging and entertaining the film could have been and by the end of it I found myself wondering what the point of telling this particular story was.\n\nI think part of the problem was as well that Fincher\u2019s view of events clearly comes from \u201cRaising Kane,\u201d Pauline Kael\u2019s two-part essay that asserts that Mank did all the writing and Welles came in and stole credit (which has been long-since proven to be false). This makes the ending seem like Fincher has some sort of personal vendetta against Welles and puts a dampener on the whole film as it\u2019s clearly telling an incorrect version of events.\n\nTo summarise, from a technical filmmaking perspective, Mank is of the highest quality, but it\u2019s version of events and the script left me with a lot to be desired.", "Gary Oldman gives us a stunning performance in what is little more than a clever docudrama about the behind the scenes making of *Citizen Kane* and the great screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, sadly, you don't really learn much more than what is publicly known and after watching this film I'm more interested in seeing a film about the life of Marion Davies than anything else.", "Wow. People didn't really like this film much, huh? Meanwhile, I am here, considering this film to be one of the best films I've ever seen. Maybe 'cause I have a thing for people who stand by their principles or ideals. Also, seeing how Mank created this great story from what he saw and experienced in his life was really cool.\n\nPeople are saying, \"oh the story/plot ain't that good, oh...\", but the point of this movie is not about the plot, is it? After all, You can't capture a man's entire life in 2 hours, all you can hope is to leave an impression of it. And well, I think Fincher's aim was to do just that. To make us see what Mank may have seen or experienced which enabled him to write fucking Citizen Kane, and what the man was like. And he did a hell of a job if you ask me, thanks to Gary Oldman.\n\nYou can't fabricate stories and juicy stuff to make the plot better, it is what it is. The movie seemed really realistic to me as in not that dramatic but more realistic. But of course, I don't know how much stuff is, in fact, fabricated, and how much is actually true or might've been true. I am gonna go look stuff up on this though.", "Just finished this, and I was not a fan.As someone who loves Fincher I just felt this had none of his style that makes him interesting, and the script seemed kind of flat and by the numbers until halfway through the movie (the other people in my house, all filmmakers and actors had left the room by that point). \n\nI found the cinematography to be competent, but very much washed out, like the high dynamic range of the monochrome red sensor was too much, and it felt grey. The sound echoed from the first line to the last for me too, it was like the whole film was re-recorded in a cement room. \n\nThe performances were good, but I didn't really care about Mank until a story is told by a secondary character about him in the middle of the film, and then a few of the political parts later on. That monologue at the end was excellent, but it felt too little too late in my opinion. \n\nThe actor who played Welles sounds exactly like him which is cool, but I couldn't help remembering the much better performance from the short film \"Five minutes Mr.Welles\" directed by and staring Vincent D'Onofrio as Welles incarnate. (Available on YouTube btw). \n\nIn the end this film just doesn't feel like Fincher, it seems like it could have been directed by anyone. I mean, I understand why he did it, his father wrote the screenplay and he passed away, and it's a way to honor him. But I can't help feel like this was just not good enough of a script. \n\nIf you want to watch a political film about a Hollywood writer, watch Trumbo, it's much much better. (In my opinion).", "Just like this year we fount out Christopher Nolan can make a disappointing movie.... Well so can David Fincher.\n\nWith Mank it's not that the set decoration, production design, acting are anything less than fantastic - those are all wonderful and top shelf. Especially the production design which will surely win an Oscar (if there are Oscars in 2021). The problem is at the outset of the movie you wonder \"why do I care about the drunken screenwriter of a 'classic' 1941 movie? Why do I care about the writing process of this movie?\". \n\nAnd the film never really explains this. Unless you already were a big Citizen Kane fan or you knew prior to Wikipedia who Mank (the man) was..... It's pretty hard subject matter to actually give a fuck about. \n\nFincher makes this beautifully designed and shot and well lit and well acted movie about old Hollywood and old titans of industry and the way genius writers were spoiled and were afforded company with the highest echelons of the studios....but the emotional resonance of the movie just isn't there because we don't *care* about Mank and his boorish behavior and his animosity against Hearst. We just don't get it. Nothing in the movie can make the 80+ year gap relatable.\n\nIf one thing is clear a movie such as this with THIS subject matter would NEVER have been funded by conventional studios concerned about theatrical releases. Netflix is the only thin that would fund a movie this expensive-looking about a subject NOBODY was asking to be made. It's good they are giving marquee directors all this money to make their pet projects (ie. Same with Roma and The Irishman). But to some extent it can lead to some self-indulgent behaviour that would have been curtailed by conventional studios (ie. The Irishman being 33 hours long and this Fincher movie because about a screenwriter 99% of people had never heard about.)", "A good movie about movies.", "I haven't finished the film yet, but anyone who hasn't repeatedly rewound the film to fully understand what the hell the characters were talking about has an IQ of 140, and you can't convince me otherwise. The dialogue is fast, cryptic, and filled with insider-info. How the hell does anyone keep up with this?", "I saw Trumbo a few weeks ago. It is also about a genius screenwriter having trouble during this general time period. I think that will be a more enjoyable film for a general audience, even though it isn't anything special in the cinematography department. They even have the same characters in some situations (Louis B Mayer seems to be the constant villain).\n\nMank certainly *looks* amazing, and there are a couple great performances (shoutout to the guy who played Thalberg, who was such a great slick character).\n\nI can't help but wonder how this movie would have been made by the Coens or Paul Thomas Anderson. I think no one gets that sense of lost ennui better than Anderson.", "Is the movie having a very sudden, fake and dopey ending some sort of homage to Magnificent Ambersamds' infamous \"happy ending\"? Cause I can't really think of any other reason why the movie ended the way it did(with the husband's rescue).\n\nFincher and schmaltz really don't mix well,as with Benjamin Button.", "[deleted]", "This movie will have about as much staying power as The Artist \u2014 which is...uh...not a lot. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s bad.

Of course if you haven\u2019t seen Citizen Kane, I\u2019m not sure how much you\u2019ll get out of it. \n\nHaving said that, the performances are good, the cinematography and sound design are great and nail the feeling of that time.", "this movie was too smart for me so I didn't get it", "I think Fincher was a little too obsessed with making this look and sound like an 80 year old movie. What a pointless exersice when you're filming it with high res digital cameras. \n\nAnd I was disappointed that Hearst was barely in the movie. I thought I'd get to see just what sort of dick he was that Mank decided to base Kane on him, but there wasn't enough of that in there.", "Is there a reason why all of the female characters are portrayed by age appropriate actress but all the male characters are played by people 30 years older than them? Mank died at the age of 55, and wrote CK in his 40s. And hes being played by an actor way past that age range", "I counted 76 uses of the word \"Mank\" for those playing the Title Of The Film drinking game at home. (Not counting Mankiewicz, Manky, or\u00a0Mankybusiness)\n\nWhat a weird movie designated for Oscar glory. It's obviously beautifully shot and scored. David Fincher being the control freak he is. The script is great. Bouncing from screwball comedy to a critique of politics and the influence people in power have seamlessly. The nonlinear narrative I think will be a deterrent for the majority of the public. Saying it's too dense or confusing. As well as being in black and white is going to turn off 85% of the Netflix audience anyways but who cares. It's not for them. This is for the film\u00a0nerds.\n\nThe ones who watched Citizen Kane for homework and those who watched Citizen Kane to say you watched Citizen Kane and belittle those who haven't. As much as it's about Kane though, you don't need to see it to enjoy Mank. You might get a little more out of it but no need (But like watch Kane what are you doing). Mank is its own entity. About the people at the top who make the decisions and how Fincher is DEFINITELY still not bitter about his experience on Alien\u00a03.\n\nThe big winner of Mank is Amanda Seyfried. Girl where were you hiding because she is mesmerizing in this. The whole cast is stellar though. From Oldman, to Lily Collins, to Tom Burke as David Fincher, I mean Orson Welles(come on though, no one else rocks that\u00a0goatee).\n\nMank ranks near the bottom of Fincher's catalog for me during first viewing as expected since he has so many bangers. It's weird, it's beautiful. I can't wait to watch Mank again.", "I just finished it. I'm a massive Fincher fan. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I think the story just isn't that interesting, and I think the script isn't that strong, but Fincher is a master, so it's this weird combination where you have a story that's not very great but everything else is, so it still sort of captivates you, but leaves you feeling not fully satisfied, and a bit strange. \n\nI was taken aback at how good Lily Collins is in this. I'm also a huge Seyfried fan and I thought she did pretty good. Not sure if I was blown away by her but I think it would be cool if she got an Oscar nom for this. \n\nNot a fan of Gary Oldman and not really a fan of Mank as a person or character. Oldman did a superb job at acting but the dude is what, 60?, playing someone who I like 30-40 in the film. And the woman playing his wife, who is the same age as Mank in real life, is like 30 years younger. Pretty ridiculous.\n\nReally curious where they shot some of the scenes - was that really at Hearst Castle?\n\nAll in all I would have to say this is probably in my bottom 3 favorite Fincher films along with Alien 3 and The Game. I think I need to give it another rewatch relatively soon so I can see how I really feel about it, especially now that I have a basic understanding of the story. I found it to be a very confusing film as well. I didn't know what was going on half the time.\n\nAlso wanted to add that I think this was just a passion project for Fincher, I think it's really sweet he was able to make a film that has late father wrote and that sort of is more important, at least to him. I'm happy for him.", "I think everyone's performance was great. However, I couldn't help but see Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister with an almost American accent. Wish Orson was in it more and the question of who wrote the movie explored a bit more. Maybe a little less of the political machinations of the GOP in 1934. It's a damn good movie though.", "If you\u2019re out of Benadryl and need to get some sleep, I recommend Mank.", "This felt a lot like The Irishman to me. A well made film by a seasoned director that is very watchable but which I didn't really **care** for at the end of the day. I appreciate that great directors are being given carte blanche at Netflix to do what they want and I will continue to watch what they release prestige-wise but I hope I can connect more with those stories in the future. Anyway this one might finally bag Netflix that coveted Best Picture Oscar. \n\nOn the flip side, Amanda Seyfried and Lily Collins were both very good. I felt like the last minute screenwriting credit drama suddenly came out of nowhere (in the context of the film). I wish the film had spent some time on the real world impact of making Kane on the careers of both Mank and Welles afterwards. I think that's really interesting and would have been relevant considering how much of the film is people trying to get Mank to drop the story because it could/will kill his career.", "Took me two nights to get through it and I\u2019m left very disappointed for the reasons articulated well by others here. So I\u2019ll offer another critiques. The character of Mank is unlikeable. Selfish, self important alcoholic, and did I really need to learn about his politics? Zzzz", "Probably my new favorite Fincher.", "I can\u2019t believe my second favourite director actually put this out. Netflix need to stop acting so blas\u00e9 and need to put an end to giving auteur directors their passion project with no oversight as to what\u2019s being filmed. I got through 50 minutes of this, switched it off and then drip fed the remaining throughout the day because it was such a chore to get through.", "Was very disappointed. Didn't feel like Fincher at all. The exercise in technical aspects was pointless by filming this in ultra HD -- the sound was very distracting at first -- sorry, but no old movie sounds like it was recorded in a hollow tree trunk. And what was up with all the blatantly BAD CGI for fire and water? Both the hardest things to do, but these stuck out like a sore thumb. The worst aspect of the film is the screenplay -- it's dull and just a collection of moments. There is hardly any narrative to follow. It's not until maybe an hour in that things actually start to follow each other.\n\nPanic Room now looks like a masterpiece in comparison. This is easily my least favorite Fincher film and I considered him in my top 3 of all time. All this wait and toying around with TV after Gone Girl just to get this? I wouldn't even nominate this for any art awards, yet people are saying it's a shoe-in for even Picture and while that's not shocking because it seems like the snobbery type thing Hollywood is into, I have to say even 2020 there are objectively 10-20 way better movies, and one of them will be sorely snubbed for this pretentious snore.\n\n2/10 is as high I can possibly go, and that's mainly just for Seyfried, Collins, and Dance.", "I turned this off halfway through.

Plaza\u2019s character is alone at a cabin the entire time. The bear represents her writing troubles (block is too strong a word). \n\nClues:  the movie starts with her going from dock to desk. As she does so, she passes by no one. Even windows she passes by are unlit and there is no sign of life inside. She\u2019s alone. She sits at her desk and starts to write and makes a big underline. Now part 1 starts and we see a story she imagines about arriving at the cabin and meeting its owners.  Part 1 is a first draft of her story.  It\u2019s simplistic, with few characters, and a trope about infidelity. At one point she looks out her window and \u2018sees\u2019 the couple arguing. They don\u2019t see her even though they easily would have because she\u2019s right in the window. She\u2019s imagining them. \nLater, she\u2019s back on the dock, gets up to leave. Sudddenly it\u2019s night because we are back in her mind. It\u2019s a fairly boring scene of domestic strife. Then a bear is heard (only heard, not seen) and the plot ramps up, angry dinner.  Plaza\u2019s character is evolving \u2014 she says things like her mother died and she cannot cook. These are later proven untrue. We are seeing Plaza\u2019s writer change her subject character on the fly. Plaza\u2019s character goes for a walk, hubby is cleaning up. Not much is happening and we hear the bear again. The plot ramps up again \u2014 sex scene, violence, trip to hospital, the hubby goes back and forth on whether he loves his wife. The story is off the rails. Now we SEE the bear, car crashes, story ends. To me, when we see the bear, Plaza\u2019s writer character is crumpling up her paper, tossing out the story and starting over. \n\nPart Two: she\u2019s back on the dock. (My theory is this dock scene is not real and that she is writing about the dock to incorporate it into this new start-over story - note the lake is not foggy this time). She\u2019s surrounded by a film crew. Part two is a second, more complex draft of her story. Characters are switched, Plaza\u2019s character is now the wife and wearing the same kimono dress that the wife in Part 1 wore. Her character gets wasted, is being taken to the movie set, we hear the bear again, and the plot ramps up. There are more clues that these are all characters being written on the fly - \u201cShe\u2019s better for you\u201d. \u201cYou should be in the movie\u201d \u201cdo you think we could just go back and be normal people?\u201d  Plaza\u2019s character wakes up from a short nap, still drunk, things are calm. Not much is happening as she stumbles outside. We hear the bear again and the plot ramps up. She sees her husband having sex with another woman. She turns around and we SEE the bear. The story ends (the writer is again crumpling the paper and starting over)\nWe now cut, once again, to Plaza on the dock and going back to write. She starts to write again.

This was WILD.    \n  \nI have a ton of thoughts on different interpretations but one thing that struck me and I'm curious if anyone else noticed.  Did the focus on the first story seem soft to anyone else?  Like everything was *just slightly* out of focus.  I noticed it but didn't think much of it until the end of the second story when the AD, Baako mentions having to re-do the final emotional take because the focus was buzzed.  It made me wonder if the first story being soft in focus was an intentional connection.  I don't know how, or what it means, it was just something I noticed and wanted to see if others thought anything of this.  \n  \nOverall though, I loved both halves.  The first was so intimate and awkward, I wanted to run away from the whole conversation around the fireplace as Gabe and Blair openly fought about their relationship and Allison while she was standing right there, or listening to them from the balcony below (\"Do you love her?!  You love her! I bet her pussy smells like fucking spider shit!\" lol)    \n  \nThe second half was a lot more fun.  I LOVED the filmset vibe, it was pretty much spot on with what it can be like on a set like that.  The energy was so great and Plaza was incredible as an actress being absolutely gaslit and emotionally manipulated and exploited for the director's gain.  The realization of the film crew at the end when they all know they've just witnessed this woman literally breaking down for real and he calls for room tone.

Gabe\u2019s lines of, \u201cthis is what you wanted\u201d and \u201cI told you this is would ruin us\u201d before filming the last two shots lead me to drawing that line that maybe Allison wanted to make sure she felt the same jealousy and emotion that she had written and was willing to put her marriage at risk to get the best she can out of herself because like what was said in part one in that Allison don\u2019t think he films have meaning because she\u2019s waiting for something meaningful to happen to her.", "Absolutely no idea what I just watched, but I do think this was a career high performance from Aubrey Plaza.

Everything is chaotic and just filled with anxiety and is absolutely relentless. The camera is constantly in everyone's faces and just swirling around the disaster unfolding. \n\nIt deals with \"Creation\" or the process of creating and destroying.  Nothing biblical, but just replace writing with directing, I guess? There's the \"artist\" husband who takes advantage of his wife, even as she's quickly unraveling. \n\nIt just left me with the same uncertainty, dread, and confusion, but I still felt totally connected to it and it was more of a totally overwhelming experience rather than just a movie I was watching. I was just so fucking involved and it kept pulling me in until i was totally absorbed. The second half I was so stressed out and frustrated but enthralled. \n\nThere's not many other films I can relate it to, but I was not expecting 'mother! vibes at all, though the second half reminded me of Cassavetes, especially Opening Night, and Plaza goes to Gena Rowlands levels of emotional pain.

I couldnt really grasp the first half after watching the second half", "My take and some disjointed thoughts:\n \nThe first half of the movie was real, and the writer uses it as inspiration to write the second part, which is an inversion of the female leads, not in character but in role. She essentially puts herself in Blair's shoes\u2014partner to a difficult creative, and what that might have meant for her. That's why the camera only shows up on the dock during the second part. Blair's character is similar to what she was like in the first part\u2014slightly meek, good at doing what she's told during scenes (just like she did what she was told IRL, coming out to the cabin in the middle of nowhere because her boyfriend told her he wanted her off her feet\u2014unless that was just a pregnancy-related thing...there's a lot to unpack in their super tense conversations with each other in Part 1).\n\nI don't know how the bear plays into it though. Or the mention of her husband in the first part, unless that was just a red herring. I think it's more that I just don't understand it, 'cause it shows up a few times so it was definitely intentional.\n\nIn the first part, the Gabe says \"Don't look at me!\" in the car when Allison takes her eyes off the road, and when she looks back she sees the bear and swerves to miss it. In the second part she turns and greets it and walks to it.\n\nDisjointed steam of consciousness over!", "I love miss Plaza as much as anyone but holy shit I did not enjoy this at all. I do have some theories and I do appreciate what the movie was trying to do but it never clicked for me. To put it simply : I got bored, like.. real bad.\nI thought the second part was way too stretched out and would've been better had it been 20mn shorter. I also don't think it was ultimately THAT deep and interesting and the actors' performances were good but they didn't blow me away. The humor never landed for me but I do have to admit the uneasiness and (actual) cringe it induces is quite intense so that's a good point. \n\nIdk this wasn't what I expected at all and I just did not vibe with it which is surprising considering I usually love these kind of movies. As the Variety reviews says \"the payoff is debatable\".", "As a viewer, this was engaging until it became clear that the shtick was the whole movie. After that, it loses steam fast - no matter what the specific message is, it\u2019s confined to a very nuanced activity (movie writing), and holds little real world connection, and there\u2019s no plot or story to prop it up . It\u2019s an interesting concept but not really deep enough to justify the film - the acting was excellent, but there\u2019s ultimately no purpose here, and it felt like it was a movie made for the actors and writers to show off, and not for people to engage with.", "So, let's theorize! (First of all I've been obsessed with this movie for a minute now and watched a ton of interviews. The director/writer and Aubrey Plaza said they have their own beliefs, but it's completely up to the viewer to decide the order they wanted events to occur.  \n\nPart 1 I believe actually happened, but I think it happened to different people not the actors you seen on screen. Allison was there, but I believe it was a random couple she did this to, then took their story and presented it to her husband Mike. (Remember in the beginning when Gabe and Allison talk about her husband Mike, and Allison lies says she doesn't have a husband. Well in Part 2 for a brief moment you can hear the costume designer and makeup artist discussing the name \"Mike\", they never completely say who they are referring to, but I'm guessing Mike is the director version of Christopher Abbott's director character.  \n\nSo Part 2, Allison has stolen this idea from a wrecked relationship she caused, pitches it to her husband Mike. She wants to be the lead actress in the movie (remember Part 1 she said she stopped getting hired as an actor for being difficult; and in Part 2 \"Mike\" the director is telling her this movie will change her life, aka get her back into acting.). But Allison, being the bitch she was n Part 1, gets her payback when her husband starts doing the same thing to her that she did to the couple in Part 1: flirting, gaslighting, and eventually cheating.  \n\nDid anyone else notice how soft, smooth, and steady the camera was in Part 1 and how Part 2 was entirely hand held? Part 1 reminded me of a Fincher/Nolan style direction, and Part 2 was full blown Kubrik/Aronofsky.  \n\nAlso I noticed that Blair and Allison switch clothes in Parts 1 and 2 (Blair in part 1 goes on Allison in Part 2, vice versa.)  \n\nMy only two grievances. What the fuck was up with the Baako character? I'm not sure what he has to do with the plot at all. Allison brings him in, they presumably have sex, and then its back to the movie? And never mentioned again? I guess this was Allison trying to get back at her director husband but it felt out of place and a little dumb.  \n\nAlso why was the line about the mark on his neck so much for Allison? The line was about the mark and how he should get it checked out because the last time Allison told him to go to the doctor for stomach pains it ended up being an ulcer. Allison FLIPS out over this line which 1) she knew about the whole time and 2 )isn't that big of a deal? I don't know, seemed like a part that was randomly thrown in their to create more tension but it too felt out of place and off with the rest of the narrative.", "Was the movie supposed to be an endurance test?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsking for a friend.", "Terrific film. Aubrey Plaza and thr other 2 leads were all pretty great.", "I haven't seen this theory being discussed but my initial thoughts were that the only two \"real\" scenes in the movie were the scenes where Aubrey Plaza sat down in the empty cabin to write. That both the opening chapter where she plays the  visitor and the second chapter where they are filming the movie are all part of her movie.\n\nI.e. the movie she writes is Black Bear, in two chapters, alone in the cabin both scenes are set in. The movie seems to be intentionally meta. After watching it, I assumed that it was all her creation. That we were viewing the final project in its entirety, crafted alone. She says her films are usually centered around a pivotal theme/moment and i think its possible that could be her having two encounters with a bear while traveling to a secluded cabin.\n\nPart of me thinks that the the \"third chapter\" is reality, where she is an actress/director and this was her final project. I understand there could be greater meaning behind the first chapter, but I didn't think it was coincidental that they used the same actors. If it had actually happened with another couple, why would they be wearing the same clothes/be the same people. I think telling the story of the actress/director in the film experiencing both both sides of betrayal, grieving a situation that happened (in the film) and watching it unfold around her sounds like the kind of movie her character would have made.", "I think I used to appreciate films like this more where I could just get immersed in performances, but sometimes I do enjoy knowing what the fuck is going on \n\nI did find the constant coffee spills amusing", "I don't think I'm as high on this movie as most people so far.

He\u2019s a wonderfully natural actor.", "I've been a drummer my whole life and this movie, while great, was also big time nightmare fuel. Couldn't be happier that my drum teacher was always constantly pounding the need for hearing protection into my head; You can't catch me at a gig without in-ears with sound canceling / a show without sonic earplugs. Protect your hearing people, once its gone its gone!", "I was highly anticipating this movie because I am an audiologist. I had some issues with this movie, but overall really appreciated the light it sheds on my profession, the Deaf community, and the importance of the ability to communicate with others. All of the acting was amazing (obviously Riz Ahmed) including Lulu and Joe.\n\nSudden permanent hearing loss is rare, but terrifying. It usually occurs in just one ear, but in Ruben's case, can occur bilaterally. HOWEVER, an initial identification of sudden bilateral sensorineural hearing loss would NEVER stop with the audiologist, especially < 24 hours after occurrence. The audiologist would have referred to an otolaryngologist (audiologists are not MDs) where steroid injection in the ear has potential for hearing recovery, at least to some extent. In the movie, Ruben went from deafness to living at the Deaf community in what seemed like 3-4 days, when really 4-6 weeks of treatment would occur between those events. Also, Ruben's hearing loss was portrayed as possibly stemming from noise exposure. Yes, loud noise can damage hearing, but drumming with in-ear monitors would not cause a sudden hearing loss like Ruben had.\n\nNext, the portrayal of cochlear implant had some good and bad aspects. The sound quality through a cochlear implant is drastically different from hearing through the typical acoustic pathways. I can't say if it was exactly what CIs sound like (it is actually different for every wearer due to differences in insertion depth/position), but it was mostly realistic, especially the incredible difficulty in background noise situations. HOWEVER, these expectations would always be explained to Ruben UPFRONT. He would not be going into the surgery with expectations of perfectly restored hearing unless there was a gross negligence of counseling on the audiologist and surgeon's part. What's also important to remember is that much of the initial distorted sound through CIs naturally resolves as the brain adapts to hearing sound in that manner over time.\n\nIn my opinion, these were two issues that were pretty crucial to the plot and somewhat removed me from the movie. I realize only someone with specific knowledge of that would be annoyed by it and without knowing that, the movie was truly fantastic. Acting, emotion, sound. I would recommend this movie to anyone to gain a better understanding of the Deaf world and a better appreciation for the abilities we take for granted.\n\nShameless \"plug\": Please wear hearing protection around loud noise.", "The scene where Ruben is listening to Lou and her dad's song and the sound fades into what he's actually hearing... Amazing.", "I guess people choose to view this film differently. There are some that choose to interpret the moments more reassuringly as acceptance. I thought the ending was incredibly sad. Absolute silence being better than the ringing noise that he spent 40-60 grand on is an incredibly sad position to be in, and the film made me realize how devastating it would be to never be able to hear for the rest of your life. Man...", "I was very taken back by this movie. I thought it would be good but I didn't expect it to go the direction it went. So much great storytelling in times when dialogue isn't necessary. Even before the hearing loss when we see how he takes careful care of his sound equipment and how much he loves Lou. \n\nI wasn't sure, at first, how him being an addict tied in to the movie. At first you think that the idea of him being sober the same amount of time he's been with Lou would mean that she saved him, which is true. But the main conflict within him seemed to be how \"addicted\" he was to their life before he lost his hearing. His singular focus is her and, in turn, the dynamic that kept them together being singer and drummer. As Joe predicted that focus got in the way of his acceptance of how his life would have to be now. Him sneaking e-mails to her and checking up on her tour seems harmless, but even when he's doing well at the retreat he still has the goal of getting his hearing back. And it's not because she might leave him, it's because he sees his ability to hear as necessary to keep the life they once had. \n\nIt becomes clear towards the end that she never considered leaving and that him being her drummer wasn't what was keeping them together, but he was missing the forest for the trees. Only seeing what was directly in front of him. And that makes it all the more tragic when he gets the procedure and not only is he shunned from his co op, but he realizes he'll never truly have his hearing back or his ability to perform like he did.\n\nThere weren't many main or supporting performances, but the ones there were were just incredible. The scene where Joe had to kick Ruben out of the house for getting the operation and therefore implying there was something wrong with being deaf killed me. Props to Olivia Cooke too, who tends to play more fragile characters but is so strong and steadfast in this movie. \n\nSolid 8/10 with possibly one of the more beautiful endings this year. Riz absolutely carries this movie and he's looking effortless doing it.", "Fuck me. I hope Joe ends up letting him come back if he keeps the implant attachment off. This movie fucked me up", "Just finished this film last night and WOW!! That ending!! Beautiful! I\u2019m a recovering addict and so much of recovery is about surrendering your will and accepting the things you cannot change. I thought that ending scene represented that PERFECTLY.

Riz deserves the Oscar nomination!", "Okay, I get that movies studios do remakes/reboots/sequels/IP movies to make money, but this film is a textbook example of what major movie studios should be filming.\n\nOriginal fucking ideas.\n\nThis film is an extreme gut punch, if you choose to look at it that way.", "Just watched it. My cousin's wife, who recommended it,  has cochlear implants.  She can't really understand music thru the implants, either.\n\nI don't think this movie is really about just deafness specifically.  It's about loss.  Ruben spends the whole movie trying to get his old life back. The airstream, the gig life, the metal, the girl.  And he can't, because none of it is the same after. He rejected the deaf commune because it required him to cut ties with the hearing world, and everyone in it. He wants his old life back, that's the goal.\n\nIn the end, he has that moment of acceptance. Of course he's not throwing away the implant forever, he's just cutting off the sounds when it gets overwhelming. He gets his moment of stillness, when he accepts that everything has changed and he can finally move forward. He has nothing, but he's finally free.", "Very good film, one of the year\u2019s best so far. It absolutely deserves the positive reviews and awards buzz it\u2019s been getting. Riz Ahmed was great and the story was very moving, I wished Hollywood could do more movies like this.", "As someone who has hearing loss (but is not fully deaf), the film was quite emotional for me and certainly \u201crang true\u201d, no pun intended. The scene where Ruben first realizes the first signs of trouble recall mine. It is terrifying when you realize that something is not quite right with your hearing. You almost want to deny it as a \u201cone off\u201d. That scene brought tears to my eyes.\n\nOne thing I am curious about: I always thought those who are 100% deaf have distorted speech because they can\u2019t hear themselves talk. Am I wrong in that? I figured Ruben and/or the others at the ranch would follow this speech pattern but they didn\u2019t. Not knocking the film but I expected their speech attempts (if any) to be different.\n\nAnyway, Ahmed is an excellent and very intuitive actor...perfect for this role. I thought the actor who portrayed Joe, the head of the camp, was very moving and I\u2019m not surprised to hear (again, no pun intended) that he comes from a deaf family. I was also not aware that the deaf community views those who get cochlear implants with some disdain. I didn\u2019t know that was a thing. That option was presented to me when I first exhibited my own hearing loss but fortunately, it hasn\u2019t gotten to that level yet.\n\nTL;DR: as someone who is also hearing impaired, this film had a big impact on me. I also appreciate the fact that the film touched on other issues like addiction and wasn\u2019t simply about hearing loss to the exclusion of all else.", "Great acting throughout and gut punches in every act. I gasped when they >!turned on his implants and it sounded like someone speaking through a broken drive-through box.

You can see how desperate Ruben is throughout the film. And how he struggled to get his life back.

I was enthralled from beginning to end, and Riz Ahmed was a revelation. I'll really be rooting for him to get some awards recognition & love, as well as for this movie as a whole. It has a quiet power to it that I think could propel it to being an awards darling -- though I know there are a lot of heavy-hitters coming during this atypical awards season.\n\nSomething I wanted to talk about was this movie's effortless case for why Representation matters. I talked about this with someone after watching, but have you ever seen a movie where there was a big dinner table scene that featured a bunch of people just talking in sign language? Those scenes in particular I found to be quite beautiful in their modesty. I loved the scenes with the deaf community -- both with the kids at the school and the adults at the house. So many moving & incredibly powerful moments. This cast also was quite racially diverse, too, I must say, with of course the lead of this movie being Pakistani.\n\nRepresentation matters. Diverse opinions and diverse groups could lead to some diverse & incredible storytelling. Sound of Metal is a clear result of that. Bravo to Darius Marder and team.", "Had no idea that lady from the walking dead was actually deaf in real life.", "loved the ending shot where he finally sits in silence with the crowd. Just the way it was like his thoughts floating in and out of his head just completely visualized on screen. \n\nThe way he was framed with the crowd behind him almost resembling the kids at the community and then an old man pass by as they pass by what looks like entering into his ear. then the woman pushing a stroller moving out of his ears as he accepts his new direction and that idea of future with lou drifts away. \n\njust really well done and stuck with me.", "Paul Raci needs a best supporting nom, and Riz put in the best performance of the year.

Incredible sound design, and just a great film all around. Riz Ahmed deserves all the accolades, but it was Raci's performance which will stay in my memory for a long time.", "Wow, Riz Ahmed delivers a great performance in this beautiful movie. I noticed so many shots capturing sounds of simple things like winds moving through fields, insects chirping in the dark, planes moving in the sky and birds singing in the forest which really makes us appreciate such simple things that we usually take for granted. That scene with Joe and Ruben was fantastic, Joe really points it out well that Ruben stopped doing drugs with Lou entering her life but in the end she became very drug that he later became addicted too. Great sound design as well, those scenes after Ruben got his implants activated were so jarring and put a dagger through my stomach knowing how much pain he went through to make his condition even worse.", "The breakup scene was sad yet somehow touching and beautiful. Very interesting to see how addiction is portrayed as something larger than being addicted to drugs, it can also manifest as an addiction to the chaotic and nostalgic past. By far the most powerful scene and in my opinion the climax of the whole film was the discussion in which the disappointed but sad deaf program director painfully tells Ruben to leave, with the very touching explanation that being deaf was merely a mental handicap, not something to be desperately fixed. It was definitely a very difficult decision that shows the deep loyalty of the instructor to the other deaf people at the commune as well as his uncompromising sense of integrity. Very powerful stuff.", "Funny that the story was by Derek Cianfrance, during the movie I was thinking about how similar Ruben looked and acted like Luke in Place Beyond the Pines (written and directed by Derek Cianfrance)\n\nThis was the first film in awhile that I\u2019ve genuinely loved.", "When Ruben's at the deaf community the first task he's given is; \"learn how to be deaf\". \n\nAt the end he's finally learned. \n\nAlso, this is Riz Ahmed's second film released this year in which he plays a musician who suffers from a sudden disability. 'Mogul Mowgli' being the other.", "I'm not sure if anyone's mentioned this, but I appreciate the casting of Mathieu Amalric as Lou's dad, as he also played the guy with locked-in syndrome in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (I'm sure this was a conscious casting decision)", "Hands down the best film I've seen this year... GISM", "Loved this film\n\nThe ending scene where Ruben finally embraces the stillness is beautiful.", "I cried the entire time.  I\u2019ve had hearing loss and I\u2019m a musician.. it\u2019s affected me for higher and lower tones, and mid is ok- volume is tricky, I need tv louder, music louder and conversations cannot be mumbled.. \n\nThis movie spoke to my fears.. and the struggle of not being able to hear.  I\u2019m lucky that mine does come back most of the time.. but there are days that go by when I wander in that quiet haze, struggling to hear the water in the shower, my own voice- doing anything I can to get a clear sound.  That resonated with me so deep down.  \n\nSleeping is the worst- they referenced that with him being up so early- that could be an addict thing too, though- I have no experience with that..  all I know is when I can\u2019t hear and I sleep, I fear nothing will wake me.  I wear my watch with the vibrate alarm on all the time. \n\nThis movie was so good, so very very good.  I\u2019m disappointed in the ending- no tie in from the deaf community to the outside world.. deaf people are the outside world too- I find it impossible that he didn\u2019t see another deaf person on his entire journey to Paris.. and the effect of once you learn something new you notice it everywhere HAD to happen..  but I\u2019m still happy with it. \n\nPerformances and sound scales were absolutely amazing.", "Just the kick in the ass I needed. A drama about a drummer named Ruben who losses his hearing. Played masterfully by Riz Ahmed. Starts by kicking us right in the middle of his band's show. Loud noises, vibrant colors, a drunken crowd shot you can almost smell them. Just an overload of senses on screen. Cut to the next scene. Him waking up, drinking a green smoothie, doing some calisthenics, putting on some Jazz while he makes breakfast for his girlfriend. I haven't been so hooked in the first 5 minutes of a movie in a long time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe characters are all fleshed out. Three dimensional humans who have all been through some shit. Resilient, fighters who are still here making the most of their situation. Everyone in the film deserves a movie but this is Ruben's. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot often do films come around that make you thankful for bad situations. 2020 has been rough, but were still here, making it through the best we can. \"Sound of Metal\" is just stellar and one of the best the year has to offer.", "The audio in this movie was amazing.", "What a beautiful, powerful movie; my favorite of the year so far. Riz Ahmed\u2019s been on my radar since The Night Of (watched Nightcrawler recently too and liked him in that), but this blew me away. Really hope he gets recognized come award season. Those last couple scenes had me just staring at the screen for a minute or two after it ended.", "The breakup scene at the end was heartbreaking. I didn't really see it coming, at least not in the beginning. If anything, she came across as needy, and I thought that he would be the one ready to move on. What do you think happened in the months that they were apart? He's fighting to get his life with her back and she's quickly moving on after 4 years?  I know that she was scratching but they seemed to really love each other.", "Really beautifully observed - the most moving film I've seen this year (though to be fair, I haven't been moved by much thus far). \n\nThe film never judges; Marder just stands back and lets you feel Ruben's journey. And that final scene was pitch-perfect. Riz Ahmed and Paul Raci were amazing in their roles - I never felt a trace of actorly technique. They did so much by showing emotional restraint.That said, the film didn't quite wreck/inspire me the way I thought it would. \n\nI think the biggest issue for me was the way it glossed over important developments (Ruben goes from signing the alphabet to becoming fluent within a few minutes of runtime) or avoided potentially gripping scenes (Ruben getting caught using Joe's computer). Also, Olivia Cooke was fantastic in her limited scenes and I could have used more of her character.\n\nBut overall, Marder is definitely one to watch and Ahmed and Raci absolutely deserve the awards buzz they're getting.", "This movie was humbling. Simple, straightforward, gripping and real.\n\nI loved the juxtaposition of the ending. His life is seemingly at its worst, and it\u2019s only then when he discovers a moment of stillness.\n\nThe final shot left me humbled. It left me emotional and inspired. It reminded me that I value the pursuit of mindfulness, even though day-to-day routines and habits ultimately end up distracting me a majority of the time.\n\nIt left me annoyed with myself that I haven\u2019t taken enough time out of my life to be still.\n\nTruly one of the most human movies I\u2019ve seen", "Riz\u2019 trailer breakdown scene gives him the oscar in my books", "As someone with a minor hearing impairment, that was really tough to watch. Seeing him lose his hearing while also losing his old life was heartbreaking but it was wholesome to see him briefly enjoy the community and embrace his deafness. Unfortunately, as most people would, he chose to go back to his old life and completely blew the chance to create a new path. \n\nThe absence of sound and how they made Ruben and the audience aware of how things would sound if he goes back to playing the drums was amazing. My heart sank when the church bells rang and it sounded like cymbals and he had to take off his device.\n\nHowever, I'm glad he finally found his peace and was able to sit still at the end. What a beautiful film!", "The Sound of Metal was written and directed by Darius Marder. It's the story of Ruben, a drummer on tour with a metal band. His life comes to a halt when he begins rapidly losing his hearing. As he grapples with his new reality and history of heroin addiction, he checks himself into a substance recovery group for a deaf community. Very few films can achieve the level of connection this movie makes you feel for its lead character. \n\nYou dont just feel for Ruben, you participate in his crisis alongside him. The film doesnt try to explain anything to you, instead you experience everything as he does. It gives the audience a sensory connection to the events. It is not just the emotionally devastating performance by Riz Ahmed as Ruben. The film uses sound to tell the story as much as what you are seeing on the screen.\n\nIt moves easily between the chaotic noise of a life on the road as a metal musician, to a suffocating tension as the sounds are gradually replaced with ringing and muffled voices that sound as if they are coming through so much water. It will occasionally pull away from its lead character to contrast the muted world that he is not quite adjusting to. And in a few perfect sequences, the film captures moments of perfect stillness that left me feeling weightless. \n\nIt is not an easy thing to watch or to hear. It is not a pleasant thing to feel the losses of ambitions and comfort, that come from adapting to a new normal. But I did not end the viewing feeling drained or sad. The ending felt complete and cathartic. I cant wait to see what else Darius Marder and Riz Ahmed have in store for the future.\n\nMy score:\n9.4/10", "At the risk of sounding stupid, why did Joe get really upset when he caught Ruben fixing the roof? \n\nIt goes without saying that this was amazing. I agree with everyone else about how it subverted my expectations. It's funny how we're so trained to expect certain things. I was expecting Lou to have to turn to crime to pay for his hearing equipment and an inevitable scene where he secretly gets jumped lmao. \n\nBut what I got instead, a poetic character piece about accepting certain situations (along with being an ode to the deaf community) was way better! This probably is my movie of the year. It just took the whole year to see it!", "One of the best movies. Apart from superb acting, sound effects were used in perfect manner. It was sad though but ending was absolutely cathartic and made sense.", "Fuck, this movie is so fucking depressing. What a beautiful performance by Riz Ahmed.", "Really solid movie with really solid acting. I love that Riz learned drumming and ASL for the role, that is commitment. He played the role to a T. Olivia was amazing as well. Olivia has the voice for the genre too which is awesome. I was expecting it to be a run of the mill metal band but they went somewhat post-metal/experimental with it, which as a fan of that type of music, and a musician myself, I was delighted to see.\n\nIt also resonated with me as I worked with children, two kids I worked with were deaf so I learned some ASL myself. It made me actually miss working with kids in general. I think at the end he realized that life actually made him happy, although he does miss the rock star life.\n\nI did however think the ending was kinda obvious. It's not OBVIOUS but I've seen so many of these dramas that I was pretty sure she'd find a new life and he will throw a new life away to go to her, only to be disappointed. I was, however, shocked he took his hearing aids out. I hope that signals for him returning to working with the kids.\n\nAll and all, solid 8.5 out of me. Can see this being a best picture nominee for sure.", "Might be my favorite movie of the year. Riz absolutely deserves a best acting nomination.", "I immediately enjoyed how they started developing the characters, highlighting the meat is murder sticker, Lous scars and subtle nods to their personalities and story. Over all I enjoyed the story and it thought it was great to see such a unique experience get the spot light.", "My one issue with the movie is how did he get the surgery and seemingly nobody explained to him how it worked, how it restores his hearing, and the quality of that sound until he actually puts on the device. Like he should have been well informed by doctors at that point but instead he's walking around thinking he'll have perfect hearing and is then shocked at how bad everything sounds", "I thought the sound design was great since so much of the story is told through that. I would like to know what deaf people think of the film, and I hope the subtitles were utilized to their fullest extent to communicate all the sound cues throughout.\n\nThe ending worked for me, but I wish that the story was about him dealing with him losing his hearing over a period of time. The opening scene had me thinking that we would be introduced to the character right in the middle (or even towards the end) of his hearing loss. But the film treats his predicament very quickly without him having any prior knowledge of some sort of hearing loss. Sudden hearing loss is a rare thing but it DOES happen, so there is a solid reasoning behind his hearing loss in the film. But it seems more fitting that a metal musician would be suffering from progressive hearing loss.\n\nAlso, I thought the credits should\u2019ve been silent. The film starts with noise, and it ends with silence. Gives a good reason to keep that silence, and that feeling of calm, going into the credits.", "Is a cochlear implant really sound like that? Everything sounded distorted.", "I remember reading about the working concept of this film years and years ago and thought it sounded very interesting.  I think it lived up to expectations.  One of the best of the year.", "Tattoo on upper right arm?\n\nAdmittedly, I have way too much free time on my hands these days, and I've watched this movie several times. I couldn't help but to notice the tattoo on Rubi's right arm. Is it men's briefs? What is it?", "I've been struggling with some unexplained tinnitus for a few years, and this movie stressed the shit out of me.  I say unexplained because I am not a metal drummer and have been abundantly cautious with loud noise for most of my life.\n\nGood film, but I had to pause it a few times and go do something else because I was getting too uncomfortable.", "I have never seen a movie tackle deafness in this way. That early dinner scene where it cuts in and out of our perspective and Ruben\u2019s was really fucking cool.\n\nYou from this quiet frantic looking scene to just a perfectly normal lively dinner when the sound is cut.\n\nReally beautiful movie and I don\u2019t think I will ever forget the last couple scenes. I cried so hard when he and Lou were in bed together.", "Are there Deaf communities in real life that are genuinely so against the idea (read: \"fact\") that deafness is a handicap, that they would shun a member who wanted to improve their hearing?", "One of the most emotional films I've ever seen maybe? Absolutely unlike any other film I've ever seen as far as the *experience* of watching it goes, but that's obvious if you've seen the movie. Remarkable filmmaking in my opinion. A front runner for my favorite movie of the year so far.", "There\u2019s still a lot of movies I want to see like Black Bear, Nomadland, but I can already see this being one of my favourites of this year, I\u2019ve been quite interested reading critiques from the deaf community as well as audiologists like an earlier comment here, as someone with hearing I took a lot of things at face value, for example the shock of how the implants sounded, the earlier comment about the discussions that would have been had are important, but in retrospect Ruben was so laser focused on getting his hearing back, that all he would have had to hear would be that \u201cthere\u2019s a chance\u201d and gone with it anyway. I\u2019m someone who gets really anxious around too much noise, too many people talking over each other, abrasive sounds like alarms, and the scenes after he got the implants made me want to crawl out of my skin but it was incredibly effective. So many scenes stand out, but I loved the scene towards the end where he\u2019s watching Lou sing at the party, sad and beautiful.\n\nAs others have mentioned I really enjoyed how this movie subverts expectations, I thought Ruben was going to hook up with the teacher, didn\u2019t happen, thought he would stay at the school, didn\u2019t happen which made the rest of the story more heartbreaking, he was really fitting in at the school and the kids seemed to like him, another movie would have tied that up with a happy ending, but threw you for a loop.\n\nKind of rambling here because I\u2019m still processing how good this was, it\u2019s felt like forever since I\u2019ve watched a new film that really hit me in the gut like this one did, it\u2019s not perfect of course, some scenes felt underwritten and the span of time was not clear, was he at the school for days, months? But that said I can\u2019t praise it enough and I look forward to annoying my friends into trying to watch it.", "*spoiler*\n\nAwesome movie. Character reactions seemed on point as far as being genuine. I liked that there wasn\u2019t any random 180 being pulled where a character acts....out of character?....just for the sake of \u201ca lesson learned\u201d. Even though his experience in the home was relatively good, he ultimately still wanted what he originally strived for. At the end he seemed to *appreciate* his situation to a degree and in a realistic way under the circumstances.  Compared to the directors other movies (which I think are all incredible), this definitely can be considered the closest to a feel good ending.", "This movie has made me come back again and again to read people's comments because itbhas somehow created this unique human reaction feom those who've seen it. Both if they have any closeness to the topic or not.\n\nI keep thinking about it.\n\nI really think both Riz and Paci deserve some nominations. Their scenes were just so good.", "I fucking love this movie. Masterfully made. Fantastic performances all around- Ahmed, Raci (insanely good), Cooke and even Almeric and the cast at the school/community. The sound mixing/editing was incredible.", "Not that there's a huge selection to choose from, but this is likely film of the year to me. \n\nI've yet to see Tenet.", "Massive film. It was only while reading the comments in this thread that I realized Ahmed was the kid from Nightcrawler. Holy shit.\n\nAlso, Rudimentary Peni shirt!", "I really really liked this movie. But I'm curious, is this at all accurate to what sound with a hearing implant is really like? I'm sure it is nothing like real sound, and I'm sure it does sound unpleasant at times, but it can't be *that bad* when its working properly, can it?", "This is one of best films I've ever seen.", "I've been a fan of Riz Ahmed ever since I saw him in *Four Lions* a decade ago and it's been a delight watching his career progress the way it has. This is by far his best performance to date. You really get the sense of him traveling through anger, denial, bargaining, and all of the other steps of recovery on his way to acceptance. The film was directed so well; Darius Marder shows Ruben's isolation when he loses his hearing and then its progression after he gets his hearing back through framing. Paul Raci and Olivia Cooke give great supporting performances as well, but the real star of the film is the sound design. Whoever mixed and edited this film needs an Oscar immediately. I thought the final half hour dragged on a bit long, especially with Mathieu Almaric, but overall it was a solid film and hopefully it's the next step on the road to more great projects for everyone involved.", "I laughed, I cried and just a really damn good movie. \nI give this movie \ud83c\udfb7\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udfb7\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udfb7\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udfb7\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udfb7", "I need some clarification regarding the end of the movie.\n\n>!When Lou and Ruben are talking on the bed and talking and she starts scratching her arms.

But the more I thought of it after watching it, the more I realized some things were bugging me.\n\n**Where's the music?**\n\n* I thought the introduction at the beginning was disappointing. His band sounded amateur. Then there's the fact that we jump directly into the hearing loss part. We never really had a chance to feel for passion for music. At least I didn't. One shot of playing the drums doesn't emit that much emotion, it's not enough to show his connection to music. Apart from drumming a bit with the kids, that's the last we see of music and it doesn't make any sense. Maybe this was done intentionally, and we're supposed to see that he was a mediocre musician and the name of the film has nothing to do with music but>! with the metallic noises he hears at the end.!< But then where did he get the money to refurbish the van like that? It looked like an expensive van. Is it implied that it was Lou's dad's money? Because that looks like and 100k+ investment and that band doesn't sound like it would be making them a lot of money. If it was with her dad's money why doesn't she offer to take him to a specialist and maybe find a possible treatment?  Like at least try. I can't see this other than a convenient plot point >!for him to end up all alone at the end. !<\n\n**His girlfriend**\n\n* >!A  lot of telling instead of showing, again. We find out that most likely she's been the reason he's sober but she doesn't seem supportive now.  She just kind of abandons him? The way they communicate after he finds out he's going completely deaf is nonsense. If they had such a strong relationship but she just picks up her things and orders a car to the airport without discussing him first? Why, how? I wish they included a part where she at least struggles with the idea of leaving him.!<\n* >!I thought him being a musician would be a much bigger deal of the story l but it's not about the music at all. It turns out he's getting cochlear implants for her, for the girlfriend who abandons him and then moves to Paris without telling him.!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Deaf Community**\n\n* >!He just fits right in. Sure, he shows some rage when he's in the writing room but other than he just learns to be deaf in a hot minute. One moment he's in a classroom not even knowing how to say his name in sign language, a few moments later he's signing perfectly and he's offered a  job at the center. The transition felt too smooth to me. It was the acting but the editing.!<\n\n>!The implants!<\n\n* >!Everybody brushes off that he's dead set into getting the implants. Nobody takes time to talk to him about it, apparently not even the doctors. The whole conversation with the implants doctor and the being release after a major surgery looks like a lawsuit waiting to happen. It sort of implies doctors some money-hungry vampires that split open your skull just like that. There are protocols, they give you disclaimers before the surgery, there's a recovery period in the hospital.!<\n\n>!Being cast off from the deaf community!<\n\n* >!Getting implants doesn't mean you automatically get back to hearing. Especially when the initial loss was that bad. Setting this aside, I do understand that people in the community don't want to treat it as a disability. But Ruben was clearly struggling with the idea of losing his hearing, he mentioned the implants right and the beginning and people don't just magically adjust to a completely new life just because he learned signed language. Writing in a  notebook every day is not therapy, and it doesn't help everyone cope with this kind of life-altering situation. Even Joe turned to alcohol in the beginning to cope, I feel like he's asking too much of Ruben. He needs time to accept what's happened to him.!<\n* >!I totally understand and support not giving him the money to buy back the van. But throwing him on the street a day after having surgery, not having any place to go?  What kind of a person/community does that? If one person can jeopardize the entire community because they made a personal choice that sounds more like a cult than a support community. It's not like Ruben would be walking around there encouraging everyone to get the implants. He made a choice for himself. A choice that I thought was a bad idea not because I think implants are wrong or total acceptance of going deaf is right, but because he made the decision when he was desperate. It's a major decision that required research and knowledge and time to consider what's right for him. Not the community, not his girlfriend, but for him. I really think this part could have been done a bit better. I know it was done so he would feel he's all alone at the end and accept being in silence but it's kinda laid on thick.!<\n\n**The girlfriend again**\n\n>!How does he still money to travel to Paris after spending it all on the surgery?!<\n\n* >!And when he gets there he finds out she's not really planning on being with him or moving back to America. I'm skeptical he would accept the break-up that calmly.!<\n* >!I don't have an issue with her doing what's best for her happiness. It's the way she does it rubs me the wrong way. Maybe in the time apart she realized her mental health was worse on the road. But I do have an issue with how she left, very cowardly and that she didn't want to go back to their old life or be with him. He didn't need to find this out in Paris. She's such a selfish coward. She knew he asked her to wait for him. The issue I have with this arc is that the film is portraying her as a sympathetic character and that we should feel sorry for her but I don't think it's the case.!<\n* >!At the end, it just seems like a romaticised version of what it would be like when we find out we lost everything. He got those implants because he thought their relationship would go back to how it was but in the end, when he realizes he has nothing, no money, no girlfriend, no community, no support, no future, he had no reaction at all. He's calm and composed and finally gets the meaning of \"The kingdom of God is in the silence\".  This seems like a cliche for me. !<\n\nFor me it was a good movie that had the potential to be great but wasn't because all of the above.", "Does anybody know the clothing brands/T shirts Ruben was wearing throughout this amazing movie?", "this is a horror film 100 percent. almost too visceral.", "I watched this movie because I play the drums and love heavy music, so I went in for that reason alone, not hearing about this movie beforehand.

Needless to say, this was quite a moving story. When it ended I was expecting more, but thinking about it more, it ended well. The \u201cstillness\u201d Ruben was in really speaks for itself. Seems like even though it seemed like he was getting better and even happier when staying at the home, in the back of his head he was still thinking about forgetting it all and chasing his old life which he thought would fulfill him.

Doesn't mean we aren't dying in the streets.\n\nI fight for these reprieves.\n\nIn another sense, it's a great breather from \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"Antebellum\", which some people loved and some learned from. But, as 2020 showed, just because it's not slave owners, or overt racist cartoons all the time, doesn't mean it's not dangerous. \n\nSometimes, the joy is stolen, and the threat isn't explicitly visible.\n\n/stream", "The most beautifully shot film of the year by a long shot.", "It's a shame this doesn't seem to be getting the kind of attention across the pond as it is in the UK, seems to be much less watched and talked about than Mangrove anyway.

He is a man capable of living in the harshest environments and knows how to survive. When he says he loves you you feel it it in your soul and when you do wrong he can make you feel that just as intensely. \n\nThis movie captures the true meaning of Christmas. It touches on the commercialization aspects while understanding that there is something real under the surface that supports the whole tradition.  We see Santa take personal the downfall of society and the cruelty of mankind. He puts that weight on his shoulder and decides year after year to try once more to lift us above it all. \n\nGoggins as usual delivered the goods, the man does not disappoint.

But if you're looking for a darkly comedic (the movie is played straight, but you can tell they have their tongue firmly in their cheek while doing it) character focused movie that builds to a well earned violent climax, then this movie is for you. All the actors here are fantastic, especially Gibson's disillusioned Santa struggling to make ends meet and Walton Goggins psychopathic hitman. The writing is entertaining, the characters are fun and/or endearing, the pacing is solid, and it's a well done deconstruction of Santa mythos. If you're looking for alternative Christmas movies, then this is a good one to watch. I can absolutely see this gaining a cult following over the years.\n\n8/10", "I just can't get enough of grizzled old man Gibson, I watched this right after Boss Level and it was quite the double bill. \nI'm not sure what they were aiming for with this film, but if it was \"Christmas Movie too violent for children to watch\" they fucking nailed it.", "This movie was honestly kind of awesome.

I'm sure this will pick up more traction during the holiday season, and is definitely going to be considered a \"hidden gem\" in the future.\n\nMel Gibson did a phenomenal role as Santa. Tough, grizzled old man, that hates seeing the collapse of the world around him, needing to rely on a pay-check from the US Government in turn for using his elves to help the military build control panels for their fighter jets. The way they portrayed his abilities of knowing who people are, if they're naughty or nice. No list, or anything like that, just a God-like knowing.\n\nWalton Goggins as a hitman with a chip on his shoulder for the fat man. Him having beef with Chris Kringle, really added a layer to his pursuit, and being so obsessed, that he was spending hundreds, even thousands of dollars, on toys produced by Santa's Workshop really showed how far gone his character was, and you knew it was going to lead to something special when they met face to face.\n\nThe kid, Billy, played his role very well. Showing how maniacal he is when he got runner up in the science fair, then hooking a car battery up as a scare-tactic. The father never being home, and the grandmother who was super nice, but being taken advantage of, felt like a realistic portrayal of a family that a kid like Billy would have. Seeing the housemaid's face at the end, with the slightest smirk, was really pleasing. \n\nMrs. Clause was such a wonderful woman. She always had Chris' back, and this might be the first time a movie had Santa and Mrs Clause fuck. You could really tell the 2 of them loved each other.\n\nOne thing I'm trying to figure out is if there's a meaning to the hamster that Walton Goggin's character had. He seemed to only care about the hamster, and when the pet store lady kept trying to push a lizard on him or a snake... definitely a snake... he said how she reminded him of his mother. She couldn't keep her fucking mouth shut either. While he definitely seemed like a lizard or snake person, for some reason, he loved that hamster. Is there more to it than just \"he likes hamsters\"?\n\nOverall, if you're here looking for reviews to see if it's worth it, I really enjoyed it. It's a slow-pace story, but it never feels like it's dragging. Every character is well-written, and the acting is great. It's not overly violent until the end, and even then, it's not over the top.

My only real issue was the fact that Santa takes a shot straight to his dome at close range, and then just wakes up after a bit. It kind of messed with the stakes in the movie to me.

Was Jingle All the Way drama or comedy? I\u2019m not particularly concerned. The entertainment is what holiday movies are for, and this movie delivers in spades. You can walk away and grab an eggnog refill without missing much. You can sit down and enjoy the minutia which was given some consideration. If this wasn\u2019t a Christmas movie, sure, 5/10.

Separately and independently from everything about her family issues and closetedness, she was just an inattentive partner and bad friend to Abby, who she\u2019d brought into this very awkward and uncomfortable situation in the first place.

We're constantly told how horrible the dad is and I just didn't see it. He's not depicted as a good person, but if you want to justify Harper's awfulness, you needed to make the parents worse.  Also you can't have Harper be the favorite child, I feel like Harper's behavior would have been slightly more justifiable if the parents kept fawning over Allison Brie and ignoring Harper. \n\nI'm not the first person to say this, but this needed to be a braver movie where Harper and Abby just break up. A lot of Harper being a bad partner had little to do with her parents. Leaving Abby at all the parties, being jealous and hypocritical, etc.  \n\nIf you have to end this movie with Harper and Abby together, cut out some moments of Harper being cruel to Abby, change the whole beginning to flesh out Harper and Abby and show why they are together, and have Allison Brie be the favorite child and not Harper.", "Yo... the closet is rough, I get that.

I know it was going for that situational family comedy but the whole family was really unlikable and not in a quirky way. I also didn't think Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis had the best chemistry but Harper was also hard to root for at times so that probably didn't help.

It does make them do lots of unsympathetic things, and they don't like themselves much for it either. Harper clearly isn't enjoying the person she's making herself here any more than Abby is.

So you could give a rat's ass about them fixing their relationship, you'd rather just see Abby get the hell out of there. Then they rushed into trying to tie a little bow into redeeming this crappy family before it felt earned.\n\nI spent the entire back half of the movie hoping Kristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza would run off together.

And I feel like a lot of folks in this comment section are falling prey to that most Reddit of behaviours, looking at one bad time and suggesting someone throw their entire relationship out.\n\nThe opening picture montage tells us that Abby and Harper have been together, and happy, for over a year; Abby moved in six months ago, and things have gone so well she's planning to propose. Aside from a bit of awkwardness on their date, every indication is that this is a happy, functional couple. \n\nAnd then they visit Harper's family. After just a couple of days of being closeted and surrounded by toxic people Abby wants to get out of there, and who can blame her? These people suck! She's not at all wrong to leave that party, or to tell Harper it's over at that point. But Abby's feeling punchy and angry and off-balance after just a few days of hiding herself around strangers; why are we surprised that Harper is an even worse mess when she's doing it with her family? Of course she's acting shitty, look at the environment she was raised in! When she's in the city with Abby and John she can be her actual self, but in her parents house she reverts to being the paranoid closeted lying teenage trainwreck she was.\n\nAnd if she'd stayed that way, Abby would've been entirely right to walk away and never look back. But, and this is the important part, Harper doesn't stay that way; she recognizes that she's been shitty to Abby, she admits her mistakes and apologizes and promises to do better. And as we see literally the next day, when she's openly cuddling with Abby on the couch, and when Abby is invited into the family picture, there is change and their is improvement. And if someone is working to change, is it really so wrong to give them another chance?\n\nI liked Happiest Season because it does what romcoms so rarely do; show a couple actually working through a problem and coming out the other side. \n\nAlso, because Dan Levy.

Consistently failing her girlfriend in like every department lol, really wish they went for a bold ending where they broke up.", "This is my pick for **Cutest Movie Of The Year**.\n\nThe first half feels like a more well produced Hallmark film but the 2nd half carries a lot of the strength. You feel it literally swing from cute but ok, to really good.\n\nAlso Aubrey Plaza, who isn't playing a comedic character, but rather a dramatic and emotional role is the best part of this film. Her character and her performance is the heart and soul of the film.", "This movie was great. I did love Aubrey Plaza\u2019s character Iike everyone else, and I get the main character hate, but I do think it ultimately did a good job of showing just how engrained someone in the closet can be due to her family.\n\nThe final denial of Abby after Harper\u2019s sister outed her was extremely crushing though and I thought that pretty ruined the character for me.\n\nMary Holland was also one of the best parts of the movie. Her lines were highlights of the script.\n\nBasically every female in the movie looked hot as hell.", "I wouldn\u2019t mind the movie ending with Abby and Harper breaking up but not for Abby to end up with Riley, a person she just met, right after almost proposing to someone else. I wouldn\u2019t mind it to be revealed during the time jump montage, though.", "John's line towards, when he told Abby that Harper not coming out had nothing to do with her love for Abby. And then explaining how everyone's experience is different. Besides that moment and the parts with Jane, very few saving graces for this film tbh.", "Personally wanted Abbey to get with Riley. Hated Harper and she didn't do enough to redeem her behaviour imo. Thought that family was terrible and felt so sorry for Jane. I'm so glad her book got published.", "The stress of coming out does not excuse abusing your girlfriend for 4 days and lying to her for a majority of your relationship. It does not excuse outing your first girlfriend and then allowing your friends to bully her and not even apologize to her for TEN years. Harper did not bravely come out to her parents in defense of her girlfriend. She was outed by her sister during a fight and didn\u2019t even know where her girlfriend was. She was terrible to Abby. Like, really really terrible. Like, you can\u2019t fix it with a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d terrible. I\u2019m not saying Harper was evil, I am saying that there are natural consequences for poor choices. The ONLY acceptable ending to this movie would have been Abby leaving Harper and her toxic family. They even could have even jumped to a year later, showing that Harper had done some growing and came out to her parents on her own. The movie could have ended with her and Abby getting a drink to catch up or something. I would have been okay with that. You don\u2019t get to treat people like shit and then make up for it by doing the bare fucking minimum. Jesus Christ. That mending deserved time at the very least. Queer kids are supposed to grow up watching this movie? What message are they supposed to get? That it\u2019s okay to be hidden, abused, and lied to as long as you get a half hearted sorry after?The most frustrating part is that the majority of the movie is fine. The supporting characters are great, the jokes are funny, and it\u2019s one amazing cast. The last ten minutes are what really kill me. Abby should have left and Harper should have had an actual growth arc. Can we please just get a nice queer holiday movie? Where no one is abusive and we don\u2019t have to settle? Is that too much to ask?", "i think harper is very flawed in some aspects but i also think that people are entirely too harsh on her. fear does crazy things to someone and i can empathize with that her fear of being outed in an unaccepting family. this film also ignited my love for kristen stewart again and i think about the line \u201cstay out of it, sappho\u201d all the fucking time.", "I got dragged into this movie on a date and I gotta admit I thought it was great.  Dan Levy crushed the scene about coming out to your parents, particularly when it was so heartfelt and serious after he'd been established as the goofy friend for most of the movie.", "This movie had the chance to be great and it blew it. It needed to make the bold move and it settled for the sappy ending instead.\n\nAbbey deserved so much better and Harper was legit awful. I know it\u2019s about her struggle feeling like she has to choose between her family or her girlfriend, but that\u2019s just like... I don\u2019t know.\n\nAbbey should\u2019ve ended up going home with John and starting over completely or she should have gotten with Riley.", "First red flag for me was in the first five minutes when >!Abby was hanging from the roof and Harper didn't immediately try to lift her back up and save her from possibly breaking her legs, but instead....went down to try to...catch her?!< From that point on I was like, \"Abby get the FUCK outta there, you can do better.\"", "A side thing I really enjoyed about this movie is how they tackle that Sloane's divorce.  She and her husband clearly love and admire each other but know it won't work.  You get that whole story and dynamic with a few looks they share, it's just really sweet.", "Why is winning this mayoral campaign in this small town such a big deal? How did the Dad afford that enormous house? Surely that didn't come from being part of the town council.", "[deleted]", "Dan Levy acting straight at the party was literally the only joke I laughed at. I thought people calling it lesbian Get Out were exaggerating but they really weren\u2019t. Rose and Harper even look the same lol", "Sloane is an absolute piece of crap, though. If she was my sister, she'd be dead to me.", "I enjoyed it for the most part but man it really could've used another 15 minutes redeeming Harper and her family", "I had high hopes going into this movie considering I like almost all the actors involved from previous works. While I get that the movie spent its time building to the brilliant Dan Levy \u201ccoming out is terrifying\u201d speech it sacrificed any kind of meaningful romance between the two leads to get there. Harper\u2019s main character traits are she is closeted and a liar. Beyond that, the movie doesn\u2019t really show you why Abby would want to marry her let alone suffer a week of hell for the chance. If I were Abby and my partner told me the second before we left that she had lied about coming out and I needed to hang out in the closet to protect that lie I would have simply not gone on the trip, but then I guess there\u2019d be no movie.", "Meh.\n\nIt felt like a reverse The Family Stone. They didn\u2019t flesh out enough of the characters, so most seemed flat. Toxic relationship that the abuser gets away with their shittiness. Dan Levy\u2019s monologue was the high point of the film. That ending was unrealistic and rushed. Not good at all. I wanted to like this, so much so I didn\u2019t even watch the trailer. I figured it would be good, so no point spoiling jokes. But I\u2019m walking away with no desire to rewatch.", "I wonder if anyone (while filming) brought up the fact that they made Harper almost too unlikable in this. \n\nThey kind of kept piling on reasons for people to dislike her. I can see why everyone was rooting for the Abby/Riley pairing, simply because Abby was consistently being hosed by the writers throughout the movie.", "Okay I went into this expecting it to be really bad and was very pleasantly surprised. It would actually be among my top holiday movies if it weren't for all the b.s. that it pulls in the last twenty minutes or so:\n\n- Harper was forgiven *much* too easily after spending about 95 per cent of the movie being absolutely thoughtless and borderline cruel to the woman she supposedly loves, starting with putting her in that horrible situation in the first place. You can easily feel sorry for her (as a child of narcissistic parents, I know all too well the deeply-ingrained feeling that keeping them happy has to be your number-one focus at the cost of everything else) but it would have been better character development to have Abby leave her in the end (and get together with Riley, imo).\n\n- Harper's sister was also forgiven too easily for forcing her out of the closet.\n\n- After the brilliant conversation between Abby and John about the reality of coming out to your parents, having Harper's parents' homophobia magically cured to the point of them suddenly being written as different people felt *too* fairytale-y. Trying to redeem her mother who's been a monster the whole time by having her be like 'Oh I actually hate flowers and want to learn karate'? And the dad being like 'wow forget my lifelong ambition to become mayor, I've just realised my family is more important' felt right out of a bad 90s children's movie.\n\n- Jane's realisation of 'I deserve better' came out of absolutley nowhere.\n\nUltimately I guess I wanted to see a relatable ending where the sisters bonded and realised they are valid and don't need the approval of their abusive parents, and waving a magic wand to have them turn into great parents on the spot instead was a bit disappointing.\n\nStill cute though! 4/5.", "Wasted potential: the movie \n\nI like complex, flawed characters but after the first 5 minutes Harper has basically an hour+ of treating her girlfriend like shit. Where\u2019s the balance? Why are we supposed to root for them? They overdid it with the ex bf, leaving her alone at parties, staying out at night, the fight and smashing her sweet sister\u2019s painting. If they\u2019d just gone with the \u201clies to her parents cause she\u2019s scared, but they\u2019re in it together\u201d it would\u2019ve been a way better movie. That, or change the ending. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s somewhere stuck between comedy and drama. It\u2019s not funny enough and people act too shit for it to be a pleasant romcom, but there\u2019s too many ridiculous moments for it to be an effective drama. \n\nOn the plus side, great cast, chemistry and a couple of laugh-out-louds, mostly from Dan Levy. \n\n6/10", "I think this might be one of the shittest family ever presented on film.\n\nK Stew definitely shouldn't have taken MacKenzie Davis back.\n\nStill it was a lot of fun too watch and I cried like a baby at the end. Having an actress of Stewart's pedigree (the entire cast really but she's a major stand out) was really great.", "The internet was right. Kristen Stewart should\u2019ve dumped Harper and got with Aubrey Plaza.  \n  \nAlso as someone who hasn\u2019t watched Schitt\u2019s Creek this was my first go round with Dan Levy and he is seriously good isn\u2019t he? Hilarious and scene stealing then when he gets his moment he absolutely crushes it.", "Great First and Second Acts. The third act was TERRIBLE. Completely rushed and poorly written. Everyone has a happy ending and completely abandon their irredeemable traits within 24 hours? Just a few more scenes showing the main characters grappling with a difficult choice before choosing the happy ending might\u2019ve saved it.", "It's unbelievable that after all that toxicity Harper's parents became perfect supportive parents in less than 48 hours. I came out to my parents 5 years ago and they still refuse to meet my boyfriend.", "Jane stole every scene. Which is impressive when she\u2019s the only actress I hadn\u2019t seen anything of beforehand.", "Harper was terrible. For more reasons than one. She repeatedly left Abby in the dust with no regard even when the parental expectation was not in view. I\u2019m pissed they stuck together just because Harper begged. She took too long. I get that it\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m not convinced they are even a good couple besides \u201cthey\u2019re LESBIAN\u201d. \n\nHarper did this exact same thing to Aubrey Plaza\u2019s character, and not only that, but she OUTED Aubrey too save her own skin. And then she repeats it to the supposed love of her life. She lies repeatedly and lets the whole family mistreat Abby and then gets offended if Abby gets upset. Yeah, what a joke! Abby deserved so much better.", "Maybe I\u2019m projecting here, but if I were Abby I would have ran off with Riley and said fuck all this. But that might be my giant crush on April Ludgate/Aubrey Plaza talking.", "Hello, ladies. I hope someone could help me. English is not my first language. What did Kristen mean when she said \u201cI\u2019m having this thing where if I stick my finger in my eye it, like, really hurts.\u201d when she ran into Aubrey Plaza. Did she mean that she is crying?", "I want a story about Harper and Abby healing and growing after the events of this movie. I would love to believe that that tacked on happily ever after epilogue could happen, but I just don\u2019t buy it. Give me therapy for everyone. Give me Harper and Abby spending time apart and learning to be alone and happy in themselves (part of the reason Abby puts up with Harper\u2019s bullshit is that her parents deaths have made her terrified of losing people. I want her to really really value and respect herself.) Give me Harper attempting to establish an honest relationship with her parents and sisters. Give me more Riley and Abby hanging out! Give me Harper prioritising Abby\u2019s needs over those of her family or her own. Give me Harper recognising her own narcissistic traits and trying to be better. Give me a reason why Abby loves Harper - as opposed to Riley -  in the first place! Give me a redemption and maturation arc and I just might come around to liking these characters the way I want to. Make me believe that that happy ending could happen- or a happy ending !\nEdit: oh, also, give me Harper\u2019s parents suffering actual god damn CONSEQUENCES for their behaviour instead of an instant makeup. Give me a Harper, Jane and Sloan who actually question and challenge the family unit they\u2019ve been forced to conform to their entire lives. Give me a valid reason WHY they would want to maintain relationships with their horrible parents. And if they choose not to, give me a look into how they spend their time the following Christmas. Give me a story about women coming out of the fog of being trapped in narcissistic relationships. Come to think of it, give me a reason why Abby would want to date someone who treats her sister so horribly and is apparently 2 seconds away from homicide at all times. THERAPY. THERAPY FOR EVERYONE. Give me an ending which is happy because the characters are fulfilled and able to be honest with themselves. Not an ending that is framed as happy because the family unit is together and that\u2019s all that matters, right ?", "I\u2019m so underwhelmed. I feel like this movie had so much potential and it just fell flat.", "Just came here to say two things: \n\n1) The reason why the audience is confused about who Abby should end up with is because the audience spends as much screen time with Harper and Abby as it does Riley and Abby. Either we should have spent more time with Harper in the beginning to know she had redeeming qualities, or the movie should have just let Abby walk away from a toxic relationship.\n\n2) The reason Harper was so toxic was directly pointed out in one of their final confrontations that her parents make her prove her worth to earn their love. The father is a full blown narcissist, and the characters go out of their way to avoid saying so, instead saying things like \"we have to earn your love\" or \"you care so much about reputation\".\n\nThe fact that the movie tried to redeem both Harper and the father in the last ten minutes of the movie really bothered me.", "I think I need a short film of Jane and John working together on Jane\u2018s book. I want to see her pitch to to him. Final Drafts, book release party, book tour. I think that the real story here.", "Was Jane autistic?", "I have a lot of thoughts that have already been shared here but basically, there were two ways this could have gone - either A. Harper is a horrible girlfriend, Abby should leave her and get with Riley, or B. Harper is also a victim of the situation and Abby is right to forgive her - I feel like the movie didn't quite commit to either and that's why the ending doesn't feel satisfying.\n\nOverall, I still liked \"Happiest Season\" and I loved being able to watch a lesbian Christmas movie with my girlfriend. I so appreciate that Hulu actually put in some real money and effort to the production and promotion of this movie. Clea Duvall did a great job.", "Really enjoyed this film. Loved all of the cast. Aubrey Plaza was the unexpected standout for me.\n\nDan Levy also had some great moments.", "I really liked this film overall but I think they would\u2019ve done better with a few minutes of establishing them as a couple, to make the relationship stronger and worth fighting for. As it was there was just the one scene with Harper pushing for Christmas and then immediately doing a 180.", "It's rare that I watch a movie just because of good reviews, but I thought \"hey, it's gay, I'm gay, I like the actors, and maybe it will be a fun holiday thing.\" I really wanted to like it.\n\nI think the biggest issue is that it doesn't know what it wants to be and tries to do too much.\n\nIs it a happy feel good LGBT Hallmark movie? Is it a story about self-acceptance? Is it a story about overcoming relationship issues in the face of prejudice? Is it a slapstick comedy with caricature characters? Was it a comment on heteronormative relationship culture? Family drama? Political grandstanding? \n\nThere is just so much going on and all of it comes off half-baked. From Stewart's character's needlessly tragic backstory to the family's eventual come together moments. It's off.", "I enjoyed it. The comedy was generally on point and the characters felt real.\n\nI enjoyed the sweet sappy ending as why not, it's a Christmas movie but I'd still love to see if they filmed a version with a different outcome for the family drama.", "Dan Levy was great and he was easily the best part of the movie for me.\n\nAlso whoever the ex husband was and Jane. \n\nProbably my favorite people. The ending seemed forced though.", "Mackenzie Davis and Kristen Stewart had very little chemistry.\n\nKristen Stewart and Aubrey Plaza on the other hand....oooh boy. \n\nThey need to be in more stuff together.", "Sorry, but Abby and Riley should have gotten together. Harper was awful.", "Clea.. I'm not mad.. just disappointed. Actually, I am mad. I went into this expecting a nuanced celebration of queer love and instead got a chemistry-lacking glorification of an extremely toxic relationship. Traumatising to watch - I felt like I was being shoved back in the closet. Harper's internalised homophobia was basically her only personality trait, and her emotionally abusive treatment of Abby was not redeemed by her lacklustre final declaration of love. It felt super gaslighty. 'I want to be with someone who *is* ready' was the most relevant line of the whole film, a redeeming moment for me, only to again reduce Abby to a passive doormat when she accepts Harper's too-little-too-late apology. The film would have had more integrity had it ended when Abby left. And preferably ended up dating Riley, with whom she had actual, tangible chemistry and was at the same stage of self-acceptance and PRIDE. Would be way more realistically sapphic having two ex-gf's fall in love (lesbian culture!).\n\nThe other bone I have to pick is how WHITE the casting was. The 5 non-white characters who have (negligible) lines are completely tokenised and only used to serve sub-plot moments for the white characters. I found it hard to sympathise with the poor little rich-white-girl trope. And the sister dynamic was so abusive? Huge immaturity red flags. I agree that Jane was a redeeming character in her integrity and joy, however my enjoyment of her was undermined by the discomfort I felt at her character seemingly written to be Aspergers - it felt like an ignorant neurotypical writer's tokenistic version of ASD, reducing the character to a caricature and making me extremely uncomfortable, if not offended (as someone on the spectrum). She  also received some of the most abusive treatment exhibited in the film, poorly passed of as comedy. The book publication was the bare minimum the character deserved.\n\nOverall, every minority group is hard done by in the 'Happiest Season', and my skin crawls at the heteronormativity seeping through the cracks in the plot. The attempts at slapstick comedy fall flat, the 'happing ending' is my version of queer horror, and ultimately I feel it was written to appeal more to a straight audience so as to do better at the box office.", "Anybody else think that Abby was going to end up with Riley?", "I liked the movie even though it had its issues. Riley\u2019s speech about how hard it is to love someone in the closet who couldn\u2019t accept themselves for who they are BROKE me because I was in a similar situation and it\u2019s so painful. \n\nAubrey Plaza stole the whole movie for me. \n\nI just wish we got to learn more about Harper and got to see her more fleshed out and her more positive qualities so that I could actually root for her and Abby\u2019s relationship.", "The premise was great but the execution was half assed and full of cliches. From what I gathered from the trailer I thought it would be about Kristen Stewart learning about her girlfriend from her ex. But around the half point of the movie for me, it took a nosedive into another ordinary christmas movie. If you just took out the LGBT parts it would be forgetful. \nThe only redeeming part for me was John. At the start, he felt like a stereotypical gay friend but he stole every scene in the movie, especially when he supports Abby when she left the house. \nOverall it was a bad movie with some good scenes for me.", "I loved it. Dan Levy killed me either with humour or tears in every scene. Kristen Stewart's performance was fantastic. I want to be Jane's friend.\n\nIt wasn't perfect though. I think it needed a bit more time to show us Abby and Harper together, and more of Harper realising that how she was treating Abby was wrong (because it was, but I'm going to give the girl growing up in an emotionally abusive household some time to finally kick the learned behaviours).", "Honestly felt like a movie about Kristen Stewart being in a bad relationship, realizing she\u2019s better than that, and ending up with Aubrey Plaza.\nBut we somehow should feel it\u2019s alright for McKenzie Davis to basically ignore her the whole movie, and treat her like shit and just say in the end i\u2019m sorry? Nah. It doesn\u2019t work like that.\nEspecially when Stewart and Plaza are so awesome.\nFirst time i\u2019ve seen Dan Levy and he\u2019s great, and a copy of his dad.\n6/10. If Harper would\u2019ve ended up with Riley - 7/10.\nI bet if this was movie about a straight coupe, critics would be much more harsh to it", "I really enjoyed this film; loved the story, direction, and the cast. I am from a family with two other sisters, and the dynamic between the three sisters was hilariously accurate.\n\nAnother thing I noticed: There is a lot of criticism towards Harper's character (i.e., ditching Abby to hang out with her straight friends), which some sense, and the manner that she prioritized her family over Abby for a good part of the film. I want to share that coming out to family is so complicated\u2014it is not a linear process. I am trying to see Harper's perspective with compassion and patience. I know some queer people who are incredibly close to their family, and they have put their queerness aside to maintain that connection and not lose their family. It's not my place to judge.", "Ehhhh it was ok. The happy family ending was totally unearned. I also didn\u2019t understand why they had to sneak to each other\u2019s rooms and shit. Would anyone bat an eye if 2 girls said they were hanging out in each other\u2019s room and fell asleep? And the kids randomly framing Abby. Just too much drama for the sake of drama", "Really didn't agree with Abby taking back Harper in the end. She seemed unlikable, and just a bad partner to her, but a really enjoyable movie nonetheless.", "This actually turned out to be a pretty fun movie with some great little jokes. Kind of a lighthearted Get Out vibe. Dunno if it really earned the happy ending, but fun to watch.", "I absolutely understand Dan\u2019s speech to Abby about how coming out is such a personal experience and that it varies from being supported to getting kicked out and everything in between. I believe it\u2019s so important to understand that many times someone\u2019s inability to come out has nothing to do with their partner and everything to do with themselves. \n\nHarper wasn\u2019t wrong for wanting to stay in the closet, it\u2019s such a personal choice (she was absolutely wrong for outing Riley\u2019s character though) but I also think Abby wasn\u2019t wrong either. Her line \u201cI want to be with someone that\u2019s ready\u201d is such a fucking important one. Often times were made to feel guilty for not wanting to date someone in the closet. And while you are not allowed to tell someone when and how they should come out, you most certainly are allowed to choose whom you love and \u201cout\u201d is an acceptable standard to have. I think that needs to be talked about more.\n\nHarper coming out to her partners and telling Abby \u201cno wait look see I did it I love you\u201d and Abby responding with \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s too late\u201d was so...painful. But fair. I really wish Abby had left and Harper had had to deal with that. I think it would have made for a more impactful story if Harper was made to truly feel the effects of the pain she caused not only Abby, but Riley as well. Her \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d to Riley does not, in any way, make up for outing a teenager. Harpers character fell flat for me. \n\nI know it\u2019s a movie and everything but I just feel they dropped the ball in the last 30 minutes. \n\nBut I\u2019m also a sucker for cheesy rom coms that take place during the holidays. And I\u2019ve had a major crush on Kristen Stewart since she was in Twilight so I\u2019ll take what I can get.", "Harper was an asshole through the whole movie, and in no way made up for it. Also that throw away line she said about how she found Kristen \"John taught me about trackers\" NO lol\n\nJohn is Kristens friend, not Harper's, and Kristen just found out about the tracker the day she left, meaning there's no way Harper talked with John about trackers let alone buying one and using one.  Stupid line, and if it were real then would've been further reason to break up with her cause that's an obsessive level of paranoia towards her gf. I know it's a joke for the audience, but it made no sense in the internal logic of the movie.\n\nLast thing, the phone call at the end was contrived. The writers prioritized convenience over truth/reality. If he wanted the job he would've had to hide his gay daughters sexuality? Lmao is this movie set in the 70s or something? His character is conservative, but conservatives don't care if his daughter is gay (Dave Rubin is famous on the right and he is gay and married. despite common belief hardly anyone cares who you have sex with). In fact, in reality and not Hollywood illogical narrative, having a gay daughter would be a political lottery, it would gain this conservative candidate some liberal voters in addition to his conservative base.\n\nIn conclusion, it was ok, not a great movie. The beginning had Get Out vibes lol. The \"funny\" character was mostly a miss, but near the end had one or two good moments. Considering the errors, some that I already mentioned, i don't see this movie being rewatchable.", "I liked it because it really showed the complexity of the relationship, and the internalized shame vs the being forced back into the closet and how both women went through thier own journey.\n\n Both perspectives were valid, and raw, and honest. And complex with it's own unique baggage. I also like the happy ending, even though not every story ends that way in real life.\n\n It shows that you can go through messy, complicated conflicts, and not just throw away an entire relationship because of it.", "I've never seen Dan Levy in anything before and he was easily my favourite character. He's hilarious and his monologue was really moving.\n\nKristen Stewart is also really good in this film. Apart from Stewart and Levy, it's a cute but mediocre Christmas rom-com, but about a lesbian couple. It's nice that now there exists a mainstream lesbian rom-com, but it could've been better. The pacing is awkward, Davis and Stewart don't have much chemistry and Harper's family is too mean and their relationships are too toxic to make the sudden happy end believable.\n\n7/10 (with a big sympathy bonus for Levy, Stewart and Aubrey Plaza)", "I wasn't planning on watching this movie, but something about the trailer compelled me to give it a shot. I agree with the other comments saying Riley and Abby should've connected. Abby was treated like a criminal and was treated like a pity invite by Harper's parents. \n\nI'm glad Jane got a good ending. Did John and Jane become besties?", "Mackenzie Davis\u2019s character SUCKED. How fucking selfish can you be to ask your SO to come home for Christmas when you haven\u2019t even come out to your parents? I get how frustrating and terrifying that can be and IS for many people, but this is 2020, not 2005. Having grown up conservative, I can say with a fair degree of certainty that unless your parents are the most hardline conservative people in the world, they\u2019ll most likely accept the fact that you\u2019re gay even if they\u2019re not thrilled with it. I can even accept that dad behaving the way he did bc he was running for office: not an excuse, but I understand. For Davis to stand in the middle of the room and lie about being a lesbian after she just told Kay-Stew that she wanted to be with her is unforgivable. I would have broken up with her right there. Obviously for plot convenience they have to get back together but that is some straight up disrespectful, manipulative horseshit. Thank God for Dan Levy.", "I really wanted to like this more than I did. It's a shame too, because the first 15 minutes or so are super cute and I was hopeful this would end up another holiday classic. That being said, I just think the tone of this ended up feeling off.\n\nYes, LGBTQ romance is definitely minimized in major film in comparison to hetero relationships, but did they have to go with the most basic plot ever by shoving one of the women into the closet? That story has been told 100 times. It's 2020, not 2002, surely there are other plots gay characters can have other than overcoming their fear of being outed. \n\nThat being said, since they did pick this plot to pivot around, did they have to make Harper and her family the worst people on earth?? At first I was chuckling at how awkward everything seemed, but it just reaches a point where they're all so annoying and repugnant that I didn't want to see any of them redeemed (including Harper.)\n\nThere's something so annoyingly cloying and false to the resolution of this movie to me. Some relationships aren't worth saving. That can be a relationship with toxic parents or siblings too. I think in this case the happier ending would have been Abby ending up with Riley, and with Harper understanding that she needed time to learn to live her truth on her own.", "I really enjoyed it, one of my favourite new Christmas releases in years, and actually really refreshing to see a positive, happy LGBT film.

You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. I come from a very familiar conservative high pressure family that must always please their family and I was shaking to my core when i finally came out. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. Would i have made the same bad decisions as Harper?  No, but i understand they were under immense pressure and stress during the holidays with their family and bringing home their loved one (even as just a friend) for the first time. Plus, doesn\u2019t all of these lazy complaints kind of completely defeat the entire purpose of Dan Levy\u2019s amazing speech they gave??? \n\nLastly, everyone assuming that Abbie and Riley should have been together really do not understand queer relationships and it\u2019s borderline insulting that any two queer people who are together and have good chemistry must automatically be shipped together. Queer people find embrace, solidarity, and acceptance among each other. Automatically assuming that Riley showing kindness and empathy towards Abbie means that they must get together has a very limited view of how queer people interact with each other.", "I really enjoyed it a lot. It was sweet and all around well acted and directed.     \nMy biggest two complaints are that 'evil sister' was a bit too antagonistic for her change in the end to be believable and Harper was a real ass to Abby and I had a really hard time forgiving her.     \nThat said, Harper basically abandoning Abby in the middle part made me really feel for Abby so I'm not even sure if her being less self absorbed would have improved or weakened the movie as a whole...", "This was a solid ass christmas movie.

The only thing I didn't enjoy in the first one were the elves, though I completely accepted them since they  made the movie much more enjoyable for kids. In the sequel however they decided to double down on the elves and everytging that goes with it, p.e. humor for children, a really simple plot etc. I understand that it was probably a WAY more profitable approach to go with the highly marketable minion-like creatures but thats makes the movie unfaithful to the first one and -what i believe- it stood for. For me it was a way for adult not only to enjoy a movie for kids but to enjoy christmas overall and be filled with joy and christmas spirit. On the other hand, Christmas Chronicles 2 is just a plain old fashioned kids christmas movie with some mediocre action. Even if the lesson the characters and the audience \"learn\" at the end is to value and love our families even in tough conditions which isn't a bad thing to teach children, it is completely ruined for me since instead of using the plot and decent character development, the movie just spits it on our faces in the end through dialogue. That's not the only case of needless explanations throughout the film. Such types of dialogue thrive in the hands of the \"antagonist\" who instead of being menacing through his actions is always having one liners such as \"You are going to pay Santa\" while talking to himself. It's not just the lacklaster villain though but the dissapointing choices for the heroes as well. Let me just say WHY WASN'T TEDDY IN THE DAMN MOVIE? He was our protagonist in the previous movie along with his sister and the means to make the movie more accessible to older audiences. But since this one is just for kids we should forget about him and give Kate (our protagonist) a goofy kid sidekick. I don't have any problem whatsoever with the cast mind you just with the writing. I don't want to go into any more detail since i didn't even intend to write this much about a movie series I don't really care about. I am just going to say that the plot and pacing left me bored to the bone with all the aforementioned flaws and more making me cringe and in the end disliking the film. Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie and wasting your evening unless you are watching it with your kids. Instead you could watch Klaus, also on Netflix, which I too intend to see because of the overhaul of positive comments and reviews it has gotten.

It shows what their rural community has become overtime and the changes especially brought because of the growth of poverty and opioid epidemic in their hometown.

Throughout the whole movie, I felt that the movie shows that she does want to get out but being sober is hard especially considering the drugs she got hooked on.

A theme the movie left out that I think is tragic is how his girlfriend helped guide him to a new way of functioning in the world. She helped teach him how to communicate and express without immediately going to the dark side and yelling or being defensive. In the book he explains how she made him recognize we all have our own stories and that just because someone disagrees with him doesn't mean it's personal. This aspect of his story resonated with me because I had a similar experience. I grew up impoverished and my family communicated through anger, grudges and defensiveness. By example I was taught poor eating and spending habits. When I met my girlfriend she stuck with me while I slowly unlearned all this dysfunction. Living that way is like building your own personal prison that occupies your mind and energy and hinders growth. My girlfriend was similar to Mawmaw character for me in life and watching the way her and her family function in a happy healthy manner was almost mind blowing. I had never been exposed to that and it's so much better than anger.", "I went into this expecting to hate it, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

I thought she was pretty decent though.", "Don't go by what the so-called critics say. No matter how bad you think this movie is, it most definitely isn't a 26%. The main reason why critics and Hollywood elites are so critical of it is because it encompasses the idea that people can break out of the poverty cycle through hard work, dedication, and good decisions - which goes against the key agenda that poor people cannot be held accountable for their own outcomes.\n\nWatch the movie yourself and then make an informed decision.", "From Letterboxd:\n>Mawmaw and Peepaw use hill people wisdom to help huge, fat pussy get an internship at The Heritage Foundation.", "Critics don't like it but viewers do, positive sign it's good.", "It\u2019s really not that bad. Everyone is piling on it because of the source material and the recent election, which is understandable, but the movie couldn\u2019t care less about politics. It\u2019s less about understanding the rural Trump supporter and more about how family struggles such as poverty and substance abuse are cyclical. And how the old saying \u201cfamilies stick together\u201d can be as toxic as it is heartwarming. \n\nI have read the book and I certainly don\u2019t agree with its conclusions. I suspect Ron Howard doesn\u2019t either which is why the ignores that aspect in favor of its characters. That\u2019s always been Howard\u2019s MO and why he\u2019s been so successful with films like Apollo 13 and Rush. It\u2019s also led him to The Dilemma so it\u2019s not a foolproof strategy. Howard\u2019s direction, the score, and camerawork are all serviceable but it\u2019s missing an edge like we saw in The Florida Project or just recently The Devil All the Time. This is a much more glossy product and it suffers for it. \n\nThe performances are all fine, if not a bit desperate. It\u2019s hard to separate the celebrity from the performance, even though they look a lot like their real-life counterparts.

The people who are saying that most likely have an axe to grind against Vance, which is fine but the movie isn\u2019t political at all so to harp on that is missing the point.

I\u2019ve seen the diversity of poverty and to see critics throw the term \u201cstereotype\u201d as if fearing audiences would be universally dumb enough to take hillbilly elegy\u2019s portrayal of ONE redneck family at face value (saying this as a non-white non-American). \n\nI\u2019m surprised none of the critics talked abt how the theme of family and loyalty underscores the JD\u2019s conflict of choosing between being held back by difficult family situations and pursuing opportunities that improves one\u2019s QoL and having to balance that. It\u2019s like some critics are too privileged to understand the concept of making compromises and need black and white solutions to a story abt overcoming poverty.\n\nAnyway I enjoyed the film, I got emotional from the family tensions. Glenn Close and Amy Adams and Haley Bennett and JD actor were brilliant and I felt so much for them. No one seemed like a stock character to me and I felt the depth of their character and their needs even in the \u201cvagueness of adversity stories\u201d (paraphrased from another critic I just read)", "I don\u2019t think this is the worst movie of the year, but I did not like the use of the flashbacks. I get that some liberties are taken with biographical movies, but I don\u2019t understand why they completely invented JD\u2019s trip back home to care for his mother after she overdosed when that never happened.

How far it drifted from the book or what else Howard could have included wasn't even a thought for me, which seems to be the main critique of the film. IDK how many other themes Howard could have added before losing the story he wanted to tell, which was a biopic of JD Vance.\n\nNot sure who Howard pissed off to get so many negative reviews, but yeah, this isn't the worst movie of Amy Adams' career at all. Arrival was lol.  \nPutting addiction on film is hardly ever easy. But I thought Adams did very well. Who could hit a child actor nowadays and keep it together...c'mon. Addicts are over the top. She had to be over the top.", "It's a good movie if you're a 13 year old and haven't been exposed to destruction from drugs stories yet in cinema.

He simply drug the film down. either from lack of talent and/or bad direction it's hard to tell. \nThat and framing it as 24 hours really was what sunk this film. Also, this character is in one of the top schools in the world, studying for an elite graduate degree. He has just very successfully finished a grueling first year of law school preceded by a tour of duty in iraq and by four years in one of the top public schools in the country. After all this, he is interviewing at the top law firms in the country in Washington DC with some of the most powerful people in the US. Yet he is somehow a fish out of water who has a panic attack because he is confused by the silverware that he had never once considered? It just started off so idiotic unrealistically. And why would such a great woman be with someone like that? None of the narrative outside of his dysfunctional family made sense.\nThere is a really good movie here, but basically Howard with his trite framing of the story in 24 hours with the world's most successful buffoon that leads to unnecessary hurried pacing and the main actor's acting just ruined it for me.\nIt's too bad.

So expertly made. Smooth as fuck transitions from scenes of joy to scenes of injustice. Even during the scenes portraying joy, you can\u2019t help but feel the underlying tension. Then the protest happens and jesus\u2014 the percussion, the increasing chanting and shaky cam\u2014just terrifying and beautiful. And the simple orchestral score that plays as they slowly enter the courthouse is just...idk what to say, man. This is stellar all around.", " Wow. This is absolutely\u00a0magnificent.\n\nWatching Mangrove made me realize just how mediocre the direction of The Trial of the Chicago 7 is. This movie is much better in every regard. It has fleshed-out, multi-faceted characters, a great Mica Levi score, astounding performances by Letitia Wright, Shaun Parkes and Malachi Kirby, it's emotional, intense and looks amazing. In terms of editing, cinematography and blocking, Mangrove is an absolute piece of art. It's also ridiculously well paced, the runtime of over 120 minutes flew by like nothing. In fact, I would've watched a whole mini-series about the Mangrove and the trial! Even the parts before the actual trial are wonderful. I loved how the setting of the West Indian community of Notting Hill was depicted, the interactions between the characters, the joy of the opening night at the Mangrove with everyone dancing together on the street to steel pan music and how real every character felt (especially Frank Crichlow is an amazing protagonist). And the depiction of the harassment by the police constables is intense and truly\u00a0frightening.\n\nMangrove is one of the best films I've seen this year and sadly feels more timely than ever. It's an important film made by a terrific writer and director and it's a shame that it's only released on television and VoD. This made-for-TV production is better than most films in theatres and should in fact be in serious awards consideration! How can a feature-length film this good by an acclaimed director be ineligible for film awards? If it was released as a stand-alone film and not as part of an anthology, I'm positive that this would've been a lock for several Oscar nominations. Let's hope that it'll get its recognition at TV\u00a0awards!\n\n9/10\n\n(review copied from my [Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/1tdusT) page)", "What makes Steve McQueen such a special director is his incredible eye for the subtle acts of human experience. It's the tight close ups of mouths quivering in fear, finger nails scrapping in confined anger, and simple angry looks. This is a film full of justified righteous anger but it's more contained than most.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest reason this works is that it's a sole focus on a special kind of individual resistance through Frank Crichlow (portrayed absolutely brilliantly by Shaun Parkes), a different kind of resistance from the ones we usually see. And while the political activists are certainly here and valid, it's Frank's quite endless fight against constant police pressure that is so heartbreaking and vital.\u00a0\n\nFrank is the kind of political activist who is one simply by existing and refusing to apologize. It's clear he had no greater goal than to let his restaurant exist and be a place of community. But constantly the police (and shockingly long after this event as well) kept destroying it in hopes it would never come back. But it did, time and time again.\u00a0\n\nThis film is not perfect I will admit. The two halves don't collide very well imo and it struggles to find its way sometimes in the courtroom story. But when we get to the final verdict and this absolutely stunning final shot of Frank's reaction we remember what this is all about: one man's struggle against a rigged system against all odds.\u00a0\n\nAlso I am just happy to report that McQueen's brilliant use of the camera is still on full display here. While he is not using his usual collaborator Sean Bobbit, he does some amazing work with relatively newish DP Shabier Kirchner. There's a stunning use of over-exposure in one shot and some truly amazing uses of objects as storytelling devices.\u00a0\n\nCan't believe we get four more films in the next four weeks!", "It is incredible. Fantastic performances, Letitia Wright is a force to be reckoned with. \n\nI hate to make the comparison at all, but this makes Trial of the Chicago 7 look like an amateur high school production- from writing, to direction, to the performances.", "It annoys me slightly that these films are being billed as TV everywhere when they are film length and quality and - this one at least - stand toe to toe with everything else McQueen has done.", "I am a huge Steve McQueen fan. I love all his movies. Each one leaves their mark. His ability to drop you into a moment and not let you leave is remarkable. as cliched as it is, he confronts you with the truth of a situation regardless how uncomfortable you find it. Like all his other movies, there are moments in this where I want to switch off, look away, mute then volume but it's not physically to do. Your stuck there and there's no going back. \nAs someone studying law and criminology this film made me angry and sometimes you need to feel that to really feel the weight of it all. \nIm not sure there are many directors out there who can elicit so many different emotions.", "As angry as this movie made me especially in the second half, I felt a sense of community and unity just as strongly. Those scenes of everyone congregating and reveling at the Mangrove were so uplifting and made the devastation of the harassment and assault by the PCs that much more infuriating. I genuinely think this is just as good as McQueen's best and I'm really looking forward to Lover's Rock next week", "Letitia Wright needs to be in more movies", "On paper this film sounds like your average film about racism and protest, but in McQueen's hands it really turns into something else. There are a lot of familiar elements but thanks to the direction there is such a sense of immediacy to the scenes and performances that makes the film extremely gripping. There is a real sense of claustrophia, fear, and righteous anger unlike anything I have experienced in a film.", "I just want to add this quote by Sean Fennessey on Letterboxd\u2013it's an offhand comment, not from a serious review, but it captures my reaction well.\n\n> Major work in a deceptively conventional form, fronted by immersion into an underrepresented culture, backloaded with a ferocious courtroom drama. \n\nThis is such an interesting pairing with TRIAL OF THE CHICAGO 7, precisely because the actual *narrative* itself is so surprisingly \"conventional\". The plot beats happen about as you'd expect, there aren't shocking twists and turns, or edgy subversions of the genre... it's just honest and heartfelt and brutally conventional.\n\nBut describing it that way so badly misses what makes this well, \"artful\", not sure how else to describe it. The conventionality is why it feels so brutally real, but McQueen is so wildly good at mining small moments for their cinematic power. \n\nI want to particularly shout out the judge, who was fantastically played. I came in expecting a cartoon villain, which might well have been historically accurate. But in a part where his lines are mostly rote procedural fluff, he feels like a very well shaded character. He can be brutally frustrating to watch, but you feel like you genuinely understand his perspective. I don't doubt for a moment that PC Pulley's raw villainy was accurate, but the judge provides a nice contrast, where the judge acting this way does real damage, but you have a very real sense of why the judge acts in this way (and why he would never see himself as in the wrong). We get so much from this character when he's given *such* little air in the narrative.", "Just watched it. I didn\u2019t think there would be a better film than the trial of the Chicago 7 released this year, I was wrong.", "Absolutely spectacular. Everything about this just hit.

It all feels like a reasonable escalation of events, under the circumstances.\n  \n\nThe scene where she sneaks downstairs at night and her mother is sitting at the table was such a good scare.

The famous red-headed stock model from Searching makes an appearance in one of the YouTube thumbnails when Chloe is watching a video about the University of Washington.\n2. Actress Sara Sohn played Margot\u2019s deceased mother, Pam Kim, in Searching. She plays the role of the nurse in Run. (Credited as Nurse Kammy, so no, this is not a crossover character between the two movies.)\n3. Both films are centered around a similar theme: an obsessive mom goes to extreme (and morally questionable) lengths to protect her child\n4. On the other hand, the two films have opposite outcomes: In Run, a teenage girl goes through an ordeal and ultimately learns to walk without the use of a wheelchair. In Searching, a teenage girl goes through an ordeal and ultimately ends up in a wheelchair.\n5. When Chloe is watching YouTube, one of the featured videos in the side bar is \u201cSolder Grid-Style\u201d by LVSProHacks. This same video showed up on David Kim\u2019s YouTube page in Searching, except it was \u201cSolder Grid-Style PCB / 219 RUN\u201d by LVSProHacks. They were deliberately name-dropping their next film way before anyone knew anything about it!\n6. The University of Washington video that Chloe watches shows this URL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW6AWmqa8ZM&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW6AWmqa8ZM&t). But if you actually go to that URL in real life, it\u2019s a video called \u201cThe Merricam \u2013 No-Cost Steadicam DIY\u201d, a tutorial that Will Merrick, one of the editors of Searching and Run, posted back in 2009. (It\u2019s actually pretty popular, with 1.2 million views.) This same video appeared on David Kim\u2019s YouTube page in Searching. \n7. When Chloe sneaks onto the computer late at night, we see a (fictional) program on the Windows desktop called Game of Cards II. In Searching, this same program was shown on Robert\u2019s computer desktop - except back then it was just Game of Cards. Fun fact: the icon used is an image of Natalie Qasabian\u2019s face (one of the producers of Searching and Run).\n8. When Chloe dials 411 to call a random pharmacy, she gets Evercreek Pharmacy. In Searching, Margot\u2019s school was named Evercreek High School. (Home of the Catfish!)\n9. Both movies give us a glimpse of a main character\u2019s email inbox to reveal Easter eggs with more details about their life. In Run, there\u2019s an email to Diane from one of the other homeschool parents revealing that Diane herself is a survivor of past abuse.

I do have two critiques though.\n\n1) They should have added a bit more to the runtime, and developed the mom a bit more. We should have seen things from her perspective a little bit early on so that there was the seed of doubt that maybe she wasn't bad, and there was something else going on. I predicted the 'twist' fairly early and thought it was too obvious, but then they went ahead with it anyway without adding any other curves. Still well executed, but I think a bit more ambiguity would have helped, seemed like they rushed into the main plot thread very quickly.\n\n2) The ending. Kind of predicted it too, and I think the idea is fine. Partway through Chloe's talk however I thought they were gonna make it so that, despite everything the mom did, Chloe still loved her and came to visit her. And then they pulled the final twist.

It's nice to see a smart lead, otherwise I just get frustrated.\n\nThe ending bothered me, though. The \"taste of her own medicine\" didn't quite fit. It could be taken as revenge or as a message on the cycle of abuse, neither of which I care for.

Diane's ability to manipulate and distract someone who's closing in on her lies is so well written. It seems almost effortless, which is chilling. \n\nThere are so many small details that sent red flags up in my brain. By the end of the movie there was a Lunar New Year parade in my head. \n\n1 - when you ask a doctor if it's going to be okay and no one answers, Bad sign.. but then she was suddenly grown up. \n\n2 - Diane is the only parent not worried about her daughter going to college. At first it seems like Diane does think her daughter is capable enough to venture out on her own.. then you realize she's not upset because she knows it will never happen. \n\n3- Her CBG was high in the morning and low at night. It's typically (but not always the other way around) her sugar dropping so low made me wonder if a \"mistake\" had been made with her morning insulin. Now I'm guessing it was just more symptom creation on Diane's part. Just another reason she's \"needed\". Also she didn't vomit until after her medications were taken. I know most oral medications have some possible GI upset, but her medications were supposed to be treating the iron imbalance that was responsible for the nausea. \n\n4 - When they were doing her physical therapy, Chloe's left leg twitched. If you thought your child was paralyzed and their muscles started to show signs of impulse you would probably respond\n\n5 - When the mail arrives and Diane isn't home Chloe goes to get it. When she opens the door Diane is there and out of breath, the car is still running, clearly pulled over quickly to intercept. \n\n\nIncredibly well done! No serious jump scares but a gentle anxious climb until all hell brakes loose. I thought I had it figured out and then Chloe finds the boxes in the basement. Great twist!

I don't have a problem with revealing all the information like that, but I think the way it was done felt a bit forced and conveniant. She is just left in the basement to casually discover all of these documents. The box is perched at the edge of the table basically asking for someone to look inside. It felt too easy and lacked tension.\n\nI think it would have been better if they had set up the basement as this secretive place that was strictly off limits to Chloe. We could get a scene with her making her own way down there and discovering the information. Then there could be a Gattaca-esque sequence with her struggling to climb the basement stairs intercut with her mother approaching the house.

I didn't know she was disabled until after I watched the movie, and this only makes her work even more remarkable.

They should have had a falling out over mass producing not Don Juan, but Buddy, and perhaps Jeronicus should have been struggling to get Buddy to work, another point of tension. Maybe Gustafson should have been pressuring Jeronicus to work on other things, and that's why he decides to steal Jeronicus' idea book.\n\n\n-There should have been more scenes early on with Buddy and Jessica, perhaps even inserting the \"belief\" device here as a point of  connection where she is helping her dad make Buddy and they discover it together. \n\n\n-Gustafson could have still stolen Jeronicus' invention book, but he wouldn't steal Buddy because he thinks Buddy doesn't work.\n\n\n-The death of Joanne, Jeronicus' wife and Jessica's mom, should have caused them both to lose their belief. Joane should have a mysterious illness where Jeronicus tries to invent something to save her, and when he can't, they both lose their belief in themselves and the power of invention. In particular, Jessica and Jeronicus should part ways because Jessica is angry that she couldn't save her mom, and she should swear off inventing things.

His story about being shipped off to some white school do that he wouldn't learn his own culture is a real thing that happened to a lot of people, and I'm glad this movie acknowledged it.\n\nProbably a 6.5-7/10", "Loved the economy of words in this film.  Not much is said, but when it\u2019s spoken it\u2019s impactful.", "Beautiful movie, all the actors played their roles perfectly. Really loved how they managed to fuse the dynamic beauty of the West while still keeping an eerie almost horror tone...reminded me of The Shining. I was on board with the story for maybe 85-90% of the film, until we were introduced to Peter.\n\n I don't enjoy tropes where minorities are treated as the selfless caretakers of white protagonists. There was even a scene where Margaret is literally planning to \"colonize\" Peter's home discussing how they can add rooms to it and just stay here. Peter risks his life to help the Blackledge's with their issues and recieves nothing in return...not to mention we ignore the implied reality that in 1960s America he will most likely be blamed or face consequences for the events. It was foreshadowed earlier in the film that he's often accused of being a thief and troublemaker. \n\nI think Margaret offering Peter a family would've been a smart way to make his story more interesting. Instead, we only have his terror filled past and his present day loneliness where he doesn't \"belong\" anywhere to shape his narrative. Overall I enjoyed the movie, though I think Peter's story adds no depth to the film outside of mysterious friendly Native American/Indian stereotypes. Strong 7/10 for me.", "Beautifully made, beautifully acted film. Quiet and contemplative. Excellent cinematography.\n\nUnfortunately, it's another film with main characters who make horrible illogical dumb decisions time and time again even though they should know better. Costner's character was suppose to have been a sheriff for over 30 years, been involved in serious manhunts of dangerous criminals, and yet he was some how completely naive about the situation he was allowing his wife to put them in and then once in them was seemingly completely naive about what the immediate violent consequences would be when dealing with a psychotic hillbilly crime family... Took me right out of the film. I was yet again yelling at the TV \"Dude!! You have a gun, a ranged weapon, DON'T be in easy lunging distance of your enemy (especially when you only have ONE fucking working hand)!! The person who controls the barrel of a firearm controls the firearm!\" Annoys me to no end. The whole suicide mission at the end was ridiculous.\n\nGood movie, I liked it, but I didn't love it.\n\nEdit: Booboo Stewart was great in his role as Peter. He was great in \"The Grizzlies\" as well.", "Love John Dutton in this... seriously, if anyone is expecting an \u201caction\u201d movie you would not like it. It is a slow burn and very enjoyable if you are a western  fan.", "Hmm. I was loving it until that ending. I don't think >!Costner's death!< was earned or warranted at all, it just pissed me off. I know that's the intention, but Lane and Costner's characters and the relationship they have is so beautifully drawn that I really just wanted a happy ending for once. And as much as I love Leslie Manville, other than her two big scenes, there's not much to her character other than she's a nasty bitch, and everyone in the family are violent assholes. \n\nIt's frustrating because Lane and Costner really turn in beautiful and heartbreaking performances, and it's a very gorgeously shot film. It's also undeniably tense, unbearably so at times, and the violence is definitely shocking. But the more I think back on it there's nothing going on beneath the surface that we haven't already seen in countless other films like it. So all the bloodshed is kind of pointless and it doesn't offer any new insights to the nature of violence. \n\nSo, still worth watching for the performances and that it definitely delivers some intense suspense, but that's about all there is to it.", "Lesley Manville's getting an Oscar nomination for this, right? RIGHT?", "Movie was pretty solid imo. Although I'm a little confused as to how the son died in the beginning, did he fall off a horse?

I thought it was pretty good and definitely worth the watch. Speaking of Yellowstone this reminded me a lot of Yellowstone/Wind River. Great tension throughout the whole movie.", "I was genuinely shocked they actually cut his fingers off. When that blade went through I just stared at the screen with my hand covering my mouth.

(Some minor spoilers below)\n\nFor The Positives:\n\n* A extremely solid slow burn in the first 10-15 minutes with minimal dialogue and basically all showing instead of telling. Oliver walking around the house late at night when everyone was asleep for instance really did of good job of conveying what that felt like as a child.\n* Pretty solid performances throughout most of the movie, particularly from Azhy Robertson.\n* The family/friend dynamics are fairly well utilized particularly the dynamic between Oliver's friends and his relationship with his mother.\n* Larry's a pretty interesting movie monster and I enjoyed seeing how they factored technology into the mix with him.\n\nFor The Negatives:\n\n* The Exposition for Larry's origins/abilities in the second act really feels unnecessary and tacked on, breaking the show-don't tell rule and playing against the strengths of the first act.\n* The Parent's willingness to just tell their friends and acquaintances about Larry doesn't really come across as convincing. It could have been a good allegory for mental disabilities/illness and family strife if it was conveyed how isolated the haunting made the family and how they couldn't properly explain to people what was happening to them due to the stigma they felt it would attach to them etc.\n* While the ending works, the build up  to it throughout most of the third act feels far too rushed and by the numbers compared to the rest of the film. Taking a bit more time to flesh out the third act, probably would have tightened the film up a bit more.\n* At times it felt like it played things a bit too safe. In second and third acts, Larry at times feels like he's not as dangerous as he should be since characters are able to escape or only be marginally hurt by him without any real significant damage being inflicted on them. I think an R rating and a bit more grit, intensity and psychological elements during certain moments probably could have created a bit more tension during the later parts of the film, similar to something like the Babadook where those elements were utilized to great effect, allowing the movie to really get under the audiences skin.\n* A fairly minor nitpick compared to the others, but I think I would liked to see what they could have done with more practical effects for Larry and some body contortion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I'd say it'd get a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me. You could really tell this was the directors first feature film and that a lot of studio notes/oversight went into the finished product, but there was enough competency and interesting ideas present throughout most of it to show that he has promise going forward. I'd kind of like to have seen what this would have looked like with a smaller studio backing it and more creative control for Jacob Chase, just because I feel like we might have gotten a slightly grittier more auteurish  finished product.

But it was an enjoyable flick nonetheless and had some tense scenes. I think this movie works really well as a horror movie for tweens, it's just not my type of movie and I went in completely blind.

Also, the secondary characters were either gratingly annoying or plain unnecessary, like Chin and Gobi. I wish that Chin had replaced Gobi in the second half, especially since Fei Fei had a bunch of out of place emotional moments in front of Gobi.

He provides a little context for Chang'e but he could have been so much more.\n\nMy other contention is that the pieces laid out in the film don't quite culminate into a strong ending. The pieces alone feel like they should tug at the heart's strings like the myth of Chang'e and Fei Fei's journey of moving forward and accepting her brother but together they don't quite achieve the emotional payload of say a Pixar film. Like when Fei Fei first meets her new brother and he teaches her about leap frogging or when he hangs upside down like a bat and she later comes to use this information, these pieces seem like they were just inserted to create a connection to the brother but don't have any relevancy to the themes of the movie itself.

Hardly groundbreaking or anything but it got emotions out of me and I'm honestly happy for a film that tells modern kids about the folktales I grew up reading. Whoever has the idea of representing Chang'e as a massive diva was genius.", "Except for Rocket to the Moon and the \"press roll smack(?)\" part of the first song the songs were pretty much forgettable to me--I know others say Ultraluminaria was the memorable song for them but for me I don't even remember how that song goes. Chang'e's songs are also riddled with lots of really high notes that the average person/singer cannot hit so I don't think they're really going with the \"singability/karaoke\" factor with her songs. \n\nLove how they insert common Asian themes into the movie though along with the Mid-Autumn Festival, like that \"you're so skinny hasn't anyone been feeding you\" jab--I'm not Chinese, but Vietnamese, but I've experienced such comments before, and also a lot of Vietnamese culture has been influenced by Chinese culture, too. Fei Fei's age is probably the only reason why they didn't insert the typical \"so when are you getting married?\" jab lol. \n\nI know she's just the animal sidekick and not really all that important or relevant to the story but man, as a rabbit owner myself, I wondered where in her room or even in the house Fei Fei even kept the hay for Bungee, haha. Cuz like, hay is 80-90% of a rabbit's diet. But then again in animation a lot of animals are pretty unrealistic anyway. Though bunnies don't even have pads on the bottom of their paws like dogs and cats do so I don't know WHY the animators added pads to the bottom of Bungee's paws. \n\nThe biker chicks looked like the Angry Bird characters. \n\nGobi was a useless and unneeded addition to the movie. It's like they combined Olaf from Frozen and the dog from Up to create Gobi. And I don't even know what kind of creature Gobi is supposed to be.", "The animation was gorgeous. The songs were unmemorable and bland. The storyline was rushed and poorly thought out. Kids will enjoy it, but it's no Toy Story....it lacked that \"magic\" the truly great animated movies have.", "the animation was so crisp and i was not expecting to cry as much as i did. chang\u2019e and her traditional clothing and art style was stunning. also that scene with fei fei and the stork (aka her mom\u2019s spirit)?? and how the stork ruffled her hair as it flew away? wow ,, that shit hurted :\u2019~(\n\nthe whole chang\u2019e as a pop star thing was pretty weird and did not make sense at all to me but i guess it reminded me that this is a kids movie LOL\n\nalso why is no one talking about how weird it was that they gave the rabbits a love story?? and that bungee meets jade for all of .. what? 5 mins and then wants to stay on the moon with him forever? \n\ni think my main issue with this film was a lack of clarity and consistency, but again, this is a movie for kids so i get it", "Reminded me of Book of Life. I really like the designs, the settings, and the animation is gorgeous. I wasn't so hot on the music or the overall plot so it's just alright overall. I wish it was better.", "Maybe it\u2019s just me but I am confused about why she ate both immortality pills and left her lover behind?", "[removed]", "I thought this movie was pretty mid. I checked it out for Chinese aesthetic and while it\u2019s well made and the themes were nice, the story was super plain, especially once she gets to the moon where it gets pretty boring to be honest. \n\nThe songs were nothing to write home about but that\u2019s fine because they were pleasant while they were in the movie. Random aside: but I wish Abominable got more love and box office than it did because I remember enjoying that one a lot more in general.", "For a musical the songs in this were really poor especially with as much talent as they had.", "Sorry guys, I thought the movie was awful. The plot had potential for an important lesson but the execution was not interesting whatsoever. The pacing made absolutely no sense either. She talks to her \u201cbrother\u201d for a total of 5 mins, is missing from him the entire time on the moon, and somehow becomes best buds", "As an animation fan and longtime fan of Disney (especially when they did 2D animation until 2011 with \"Winnie The Pooh\"), I was very excited when I learned legendary animator Glean Keane (one of the few 2D animators left) was directing along with a promising premise that was revealed months ago. However the execution ranged from \"mediocre\" to \"okay\" at times (thankfully not to Illumination levels). I enjoyed the movie at times, but it ain't Pixar and not as forgettable as any Illumination Movie and Pearl Animation's previous film \"Abominable\" co-produced with DreamWorks. If anything, I would pick this over Abominable.\n\nThe first act (save for the brief 2D animated sequence) didn't really catch my attention until we finally get to the moon. I will say that once we enter the moon is when this movie finally catches my attention. The character designs (notably the sentient moon cakes and other inhabitants that resemble Gummy Candy) and palace on \"The Moon\" is very colorful and would highly recommend seeing on a Smart TV (I watched this movie on FireTV last night) during the evening. The songs on the other hand are mostly forgettable with the exception of \"Ultraluminary\" to a small degree. I think this movie had too many songs at times and couldn't take a 10 minute break without another character breaking into another musical number.\n\nThe only moments that stuck out with me was the short scene where Fei Fei first arrives on the moon where Chang'e resides in and a cute scene where Bungee the Lop Eared Rabbit (who's my favorite character of the movie) properly meets the Jade Rabbit who quickly falls in love with. While they don't speak, I will admit that my heart melted when she quickly gave him a kiss. Then again, I'm a softie for cute animals (especially rabbits and sheep). I seriously hope Netflix finds a way to create special merchandise of Bungee (especially stuffed animals).\n\nAnother complaint that I have is that Moon Palace (I forgot the name) and it's citizens while pretty to look at. Are very bright to the point that it becomes difficult to see the facial expressions for the Mooncake people, The Biker Chicks managed to avoid this issue to an extent. \n\nI'm not going to be too harsh on this movie, since this was written by Audrey Wells who sadly passed away during the development of this movie and was even dedicated to her. The movie had it's heart at the right place but didn't fully reached it's potential. I will say that this movie felt like it was stuck in the 90s and would had possibly done better during that period. At least it would had gained it's own cult following like \"The Swan Princess\" or the 1997 Don Bluth film \"Anastasia\". I felt like Glean Keane's experiences during \"The Disney Renaissance\" of the 90s might had bleed into this movie at times (the female protagonist having an \"I Want Song\" (\"Into The Moon\"), an animal sidekick, and dead mother). \n\n I will give this movie props for finally discussing \"The Moon Festival\" (aka \"Mooncake Festival\" or \"Mid-Autumn Festival\") in an animated film which is rarely discussed in any animated feature alongside \"Dia De Los Muertos\". Alongside giving westerns more exposure to it outside of East Asia. For those unfamiliar, its celebrated throughout East Asia  in Autumn typically on September or October. Japan has a similar festival (where it's known as Tsukimi/Otsukimi/Jugoya) that's influenced by the Chinese variation but a completely different story for the Jade Rabbit/Moon Rabbit. This movie is mainly focused on the Chinese version of the Jade Rabbit story where it's mainly focused on Chang'e The Moon Goddess and the rabbit itself is the goddess' guardian. Hopefully \"The Moon Festival\" and even the Japanese variation might get touched more in future animated films.\n\n As of 2020, [the only 2D/hand-drawn animators left from The Walt Disney Company is Mark Henn, Eric Goldberg, and Randy Haycock](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/theme-parks/2d-animators-left-disney-working-projection-mapping-disney-world-150089.html) who's most recent animation work was for the Walt Disney World fireworks show [\"Happily Ever After\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bN5b11H4_s) where they made new animation for the characters. There is a new stage show located at Disney Springs that was planned to premiere on [April 17, 2020 called \"Cirque du Soleil - Drawn to Life\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySpRt0dPNvY) that is a love letter to Disney's hand-drawn animation and 2D animated films and contains new hand drawn animation from Eric Goldberg. However, it got delayed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and the show is currently stuck in limbo until the pandemic is finally over.\n\nMeanwhile former Disney animators James Bater and Glen Keane has moved on other projects. Times like this makes me wish this movie was traditional animated (especially the 10 minutes where we get a brief 2D animated sequence telling the story of the moon goddess and her husband) and [this video Netflix posted related to this film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E6B4hXOamk) where they showed 2D sketches for some of the characters. While 2D animation lives on in television and various indie animated films, it makes wish 2D animated films might someday make a comeback. Very recently, someone at the Disney company is either working or pitching an untitled 2D animated project (possibly someone who worked on some of the \"Short Circuit\" shorts). We don't know if it's either an animated short or a feature film but my fingers are crossed on a feature film.\n\nSpeaking of 2D animation, I highly recommend checking out the [\"Short Circuit\" series on Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/walt-disney-animation-studios-short-circuit-experimental-films/3S2DLVtMPA7V). For those unfamiliar, \"Short Circuit\" is a experimental series of 14 animated shorts made by very talented artists at Walt Disney Animation Studios similar to Pixar's \"SpartShorts\". It's basically a testing ground for what type of animation Disney could use for their future projects. These shorts can range from CGI, CGI animated to replicate 2D animation, digital animation, etc. I highly suggest watching the intros to these shorts to understand the context and behind the scenes information. \n\nMy apologize for going on a tangent about 2D/hand-drawn animation instead of discussing this movie. But I really loved the brief 2D animated sequence showing the story of Chang'e which reminded me of how expressive and lifelike 2D animation can be compared to CGI. It makes me wish 2D/hand-drawn animation might make a comeback in future animated films outside of independent animation studios and anime.", "Don\u2019t sleep on this one. \n\nThe story\u2019s familiar but has some decent twists in the story progression. The final beat it ends on is kinda mature and sophisticated, I really liked it. Setting and mythology are fantastic. \n\nThe songs are mostly meh except for a few *really* good ones once they get to the Moon; the orchestral soundtrack is really good. The voice acting varies - I think it might be a directing problem, but they all sound overly earnest and insistent at times, like they\u2019re trying way too hard. Except for Chin and Chang\u2019e in my opinion. \n\nThe visuals alone are STAGGERING. People here criticizing the brightness - I totally agree. If you don\u2019t have HDR just turn down the brightness a bit, it worked for me. But like the visual design, colors, LIGHTING, and animations are honestly wonderful.\n\nI also liked how excluding the bit-part Biker Chicks (great name), there really weren\u2019t villains at ALL and it was still dramatic and compelling to watch.\n\nIt\u2019s a 6 for me - nowhere really near excellent, but it got me to write this whole comment encouraging others and that\u2019s not something I\u2019ve done in a really long time.", "Watched this with my niece today and she loved it. She's 9. I thought the animation was really great and the orchestral/choir mix between the songs sounded really good. The story kinda bounced around a lot, enough to keep her entertained with all the pretty colors etc. To me, however, after she launches to the moon it turns into an art show with a B-rated story direction.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the animation is top notch. Some of the best I've seen to date. Watch it with HDR if you can.", "Was i the only one whose eyes struggled really hard with this movie? i had to turn the brightness waaay down because the green porcupine character was just ubearable to look at.", "Personal Enjoyment: 3\nWhile the film tackles loss in a form of death it still affected me as the general theme of losing a loved one is something I recently relate to. It was painfully impactful. Be it break ups, death, friendships drifting apart, this films entire premise will hit you and it might be painful. It does, however come with a nice underlying of hope within the sadness. I wouldn't mind watching it again but would need to be in a mood to cry. I will definitely watch the musical performances again without skipping a beat regardless of my mood, there were some bops in this. Having grown up and lived in China, I personally really enjoyed the Chinese influences and elements that this film incorporated. I love the ever growing representation that people of colour are starting to get and am especially excited to see representation of a place I can call home.\n\nFilm Language: 2\nThe animation was gorgeous, similar to how \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" embraced its animation this film does the same. Less extreme but still effective and beautiful. The voice acting was great as well, each song felt professional, giving a feeling of real life Chinese-pop performances and feeling authentically Chinese. The writing was smart, having great parallels and symbolism that was effective and impactful, that being said it was rather predictable which may reduce its impact to some\n\nPositives:\n- the music was a surprise but was very enjoyable, incorporating different styles of Chinese music (C-pop, rap, traditional(?))\n- Chinese representation, traditional Chinese mythology with the moon festival with a modern spin to it as well as characters containing accurate Chinese features while still maintaining that \"disney princess\" style\n- the animation, wow the animation was gorgeous and unique really embracing the films medium and experimenting with different unique styles of animation which enhanced the story\n\nNegatives:\n- if you don't like musicals, you won't enjoy this film as half the film is sung\n- the plot is very simple and predictable, not \"bad\" per say, but a concern if you're looking for something more unique in terms of story\n\nHow to watch the film:\n- Mode: theater\n- Attention: full attention\n- With Who: significant other or with family\n\nFilm Recommendation:\n- Kubo and the 2 Strings (Asian influenced story, beautiful animation, gorgeous music)\n- Mulan (Chinese centered film)\n- Tangled (music was similar in \"vibe\" which makes sense as the director produced Tangled)", "I honestly suprised how many people thought it was mediocre or straight up bad. I loved this film so much, knowing the history in making this film was lovely. I love animation and was so pleased with the style in this film from the traditional chinese culture to the moon with Lumaria. The story dealt with its themes very well it made me cry like crazy, I could go on that it borrows from alot of Disney tropes but nothing is fully original these days. In all fairness I preferred this over any pixar and disney animated film (with the exception of Moana, Coco and Inside Out) in the past seven years since the first Frozen movie. The songs were well made and were fun and memorable to me, ultralumianary was an amazing scene and song. I never found Gobi or Chin to be super annoying despite obviously being that cliche. The main character Fei Fei was also a nice main character, it was so nice she beleived the faith of both her parents. Every scene with Chang'e, she just stole the whole movie for me from her outfits, songs and her actual real life story it was sweet. I just enjoyed it alot, for me it was my best animated film I saw this year.", "I loved it! I cried in the middle when her love told her to let go. The songs were forgettable as many have said here but I did love Rocket to the Moon and the ping pong match song was loads of fun in my opinion. My biggest gripe would be that it should\u2019ve been Chin with her throughout the adventure and not Gobi to make them becoming friends at the end be more believable/earned/genuine. Other than that though I thought it was very touching and loved the close ups of the family in the end.", "[deleted]"], "num_comments": 139, "year": "2020"}, {"title": "Rebecca", "comments": ["Kristen Scott Thomas' back must hurt from carrying this movie lmao", "Not really worth the time to watch if you know the story already, I'm all for new adaptations of Rebecca but this was so bland and rushed. It really didn't blend period piece with thriller with opulent set-fest very well. There were moments that could have been cool if they had gone all-in with the trippy thriller route but it felt noncommittal and lacked any temerity in executing them, so they were just out of place and weird (the vines and circle of party goers).\n\n\nLily James was alright but chemistry was absent with Armie Hammer; and the writing did no favors with the heroine's character arc (it was pretty abrupt).\n\n\nAnd just a personal particularity of mine is that I always liked the book's imagery of the groves of bright red rhododendron trees and their representation of the oppressive memory of Rebecca. The movie only uses red flowers, barely to that effect, in one brief interior scene so that disappointed me.", "This is on Netflix, not HBOmax.", "The critic reviews haven't been great, so I didn't expect much. It's not completely terrible, but damn it's boring. The biggest problem here are the performances. Neither Lily James nor Armie Hammer are nuanced enough to pull off their respective roles and even Kristin Scott Thomas is weirdly limp in this, just staring creepily into the camera instead of acting. Rebecca is famous for its atmosphere and mounting tension, which are completely missing in this film, despite the pretty cinematography.\n\nI felt like Wheatley misunderstood the source material. It's not a love story and it doesn't work as one either. It's a shame because he did a great job adapting Ballard in High-Rise.", "Gave this a shot cos of Lily. Gorgeous cinematography throughout and the first 20 mins looked promising... and then it sort of fell apart? I still finished it but I can\u2019t say it\u2019s one of those films that just pulls you in so you give it your undivided attention\u2014managed to do my nails while watching so it wasn\u2019t a total waste of two hours I guess.", "I feel that armie was trying to challenge himself by taking this role but unfortunately he just isn\u2019t talented enough to be in this movie. He was so dry in this.He\u2019s really trying to rebrand himself as a character actor after cmbyn but irl character actors are just simply very versatile talented actors and armie just doesn\u2019t have that. And even his best role in sorry to bother you I felt like he was playing himself anyways", "Honestly the movie was decent but it reminded me of my old creative writing assignments - a good, strong beginning which slowly and carefully builds up to something and then \u201coh crap, I only have a thousand words left to get the rest in?\u201d. \n\nI really enjoyed it up until Maxim tells Lily James\u2019 character the truth, but after that it just feels like a mad dash to get everything in and get to the ending. From that point on the movie feels more like a weird drawn-out montage than a cohesive story.", "This was an absolute slog to get through.", "This was a very bland movie. Probably one of the worst movies of the year so far. What I absolutely hated about this movie was how unsuspenseful it was. The 1940 one was way more thrilling and has you hooked. There was nothing that really grabbed my attention here. Just 2 hours of Lily and Arnie having absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.", "This movie was all over the place in pacing and tone. This whole movie is unfortunate. It visually looks good though....\n\nIt was rough. And the third act only served to kick that awkward pace into full gear. It felt like it was taking place entirely in flashback snippets, except it was the present.", "Was boring but had great visuals", "So the story end game is most people will sympathize with the murdering nobleman because they're good looking?", "The first third was really good. Beautifully shot, the plot was moving a nice pace etc. but by the final third I felt like I was watching a completely different movie. It was trying to do to many things at once. The court scene was rushed through so quickly that there was no tension whatsoever.", "Were Mrs Danvers and Rebecca lovers? I couldn't quite figure it out but she said a couple of things that intimated they might have been.", "This was dreadful. \n\nI saw Hitchcock's version a couple of months ago and loved it. It's one of the best ghost stories ever put on film. And I just couldn't stop comparing that version with this new one. This just looks so... bland.\n\nLily James does her best with a boring, lazy script. Armie Hammer is terribly miscast. Dry, zero charm. There is no chemistry whatsoever between both of them. And why they did they even bother with the accent. Kristin Scott Thomas was like a cartoon villain lurking at every corner with a dry smile.\n\nThey even made Manderley look so unappealing. It's almost like another character in the book with haunting hallways and almost empty rooms, and in here it just looks like every other mansion put on film (I think it's the same one from Enola Holmes and The Favourite) with lots of... white rich stuff.\n\nThere were some good shots here and there, but I saw this film yesterday and I can't remember a single one. It's all supperficial fluff with no soul.\n\nAnd the tacked-on epilogue where LOVE saves the day. And people complained about the Interstellar scene...\n\nIt's ironic how the new Mrs De Winter can't escape the shadow of Rebecca and Wheatley can't escape the masterful shadow of Hitchcock. \n\nDon't waste your time.", "I expected to be disappointed. I did not expect for the film to miss the point of the book so thoroughly.\n\nThis adaptation wanted us to like Max & Mrs., to believe in their passionate love story, and in the power of love overcoming tragedy (hence the cringe closing lines).\n\n...But we're not supposed to like either of them. Rebecca is one of the inspirations behind Gone Girl, and it's easy to see why. Max & Mrs. are the original Nick and Amy - only ever in love with ideas of one another, and when they are good together, it's because they are both willing to act in utterly monstrous ways in order to uphold the appearance of their relationship.\n\nThis film portrayed a relatively normal relationship for us to root for, when we should have been watching in horror.", "I have so many complaints about this film that I need to detail but one of the most egregious is the costume design. In a film like this , costume design can often be the dark horse in terms of the best outcome. This doesn't have that. In monte Carlo alone, Maxim wears the same suit throughout in some respects. When he's not wearing that God awful yellow suit in full, he's wearing the pants. Meanwhile Lily James goes through about 4 or 5 costume changes. Mrs Danvers literally wears only 2 outfits but with her character that can be forgiven. It's beggars belief why they seemingly skimped out so much on the costume design.\n\nOnto other complaints, the film deals with simultaneously some of the worst and best casting choices. Armie Hammer and Sam Riley are awful , awful choices for Maxim & Jack Favelle. Riley's introduction being him wearing a weird cape and riding horses didn't hell either. The fact is that Maxims whole character is a pathetic older man haunted by his deeds and he wants to no longer be alone. He never loved the narrator and it's stated in the book that their relationship is closer to that of a dog and owner. Armie Hammer doesn't sell this at all, rather he's just a boring haunted hunk. As everyone else has said, Thomas carries this film and I only wish she was given a better chance or opportunity to play Danvers because with a better screenplay and better direction she could have really done the character justice. Ann Does was also a perfect choice for Van Hopped and was exactly what I pictured in the book. Lily James was fine but it became apparent early on I was watching a 2 hour film of two people with no chemistry. Maybe Dominic West would have been a better Maxim ? \n\nIgnoring the terrible ending, manufacturing drama in the coroner's court, not letting scenes like Danvers trying to get the narrator to commit suicide play out to their full potential and just cutting them off and lack of imagery of the book, the film is just terribly, terribly directed. I am in awe of the fact that Ben Wheatley, a director known for his lack of compromise as evidenced in High Rise's kaleidoscopic vision of class and Thatcher's embrace of neo liberalism or every facet of a Field in England decided to make Rebecca , a film with dense interpretations and feminist critique, into milquetoast thriller with no tension and plenty of sex. 50 Shades of Dead Wife. \n\nI really wanted to give this a chance but it may be the worst film of the year purely for the potential ultimately squandered.", "This movie might be fine if you aren\u2019t familiar with the story (either from the book or previous film), but if you are, it\u2019s pretty terrible. There\u2019s absolutely no chemistry between the leads, despite taking great pains to make both more likable. This not only makes them almost unrecognizable to those familiar with the book, it also bleeds the story of most of the menace and dread that makes it thrilling, and the attempts to re-insert these qualities feels ham-fisted, awkward, and out of place. I\u2019ve said this in another thread and I\u2019ll say it again, it\u2019s like every time they had to make a choice about the direction of the film they somehow went with the most boring option possible. It tries to be a period piece romance but gets ensnared by the gothic elements of the story, causing it to uncomfortably teeter between the two. It does absolutely nothing to justify its own existence and I have a feeling it will fade from cultural memory fairly quickly.", "Firstly, the film looked gorgeous and I cant believe this was a Ben Wheatley film or understand why he chose to do it. \n\nHaven't read the book or seen the Hitchcock version. Felt like there was a horror movie in there somewhere trying to come out, but never did. I absolutely hated the Rebecca character (impressive being as she doesnt appear) and Kristin Scott Thomas, the latter I couldn't understand why it took SO long to sack her. So I guess those two parts of the story worked. It made the twist that he didnt still love her, which Lily suspects, but hated her, work pretty well for me as i thought this was heading towards Armie Hammer being a multi-wife killer. Enjoyed the film after that. Before it was more \"how quickly can I regret getting married?\" or \"how much can these dogs get me in trouble?\"\n\nThought Sam Riley was good too. Also thought Armie Hammer was Dan Stevens for a while.\n\nOverall, thought it wasn't a waste of 2 hours, cant see me re-watching though.", "This was a really bad movie, it felt so amateurish. It is on the first 10-20 minutes of a movie that you get that feeling if the movie catches you, I never felt that with this one. \n\nThe two leads are very stiff and unconvincing. Armie Hammer is very handsome, but that is just it. Lily James is very very dull, but maybe there was not so many things she could do with this character.\n\nThe pacing at the end is weird. The first two acts happen in the span of months and the last act happens in like one or two days.\n\nAnd the scene of the ball were the guests are surrounding her and a song starts playing, it is cringe inducing coma.", "I last saw the Hitchcock version as a kid and I had forgotten the events of the final act. Enjoyed it for the most part but it did seem muddled near the end. It wasn't until I read a synopsis that I realized that >!Rebecca goaded Maxim into killing her, telling him she was pregnant when she actually had cancer!<, so something about the pacing of the film went wrong there.\n\nInteresting that Hitchcock's version had to >!make Rebecca's death technically an accident!< unlike in the book and this new film. Rules about Hollywood films at the time meant that >!anyone seen murdering a spouse has to be punished.!<", "Ben Wheatley has done some ok movies and Armie Hammer I've really liked in everything I've seen with him. But... The original is an Oscar winning movie by one of the most revered and influential directors of all time and it stars one of the best actors ever who had 10 Oscar nominations under his belt and two honorary ones. This new version is essentially just a TV movie made by some guy, compared to the original.", "Lily's outfits were woeful too. Like it didn't work at all for her. The whole way the book suggested was that Van Hopper had these extravagant outfits and she had next to nothing (meant to juxtapose the class difference) but Lily looked like she was well looked after and if anything she had more clothes than Maxim and his one pair of pants. \n\nArmie Hammer is a really fantastic and talented actor but the simple fact is that in and and every possible way he was miscast as Maxim. Maxim is a pathetic older dude who is lonely and can't handle the guilt of what he did. He doesn't want a wife, the book even says their relationship is more dog & master. A guy who looks like Armie where he looks like he's sculpted from stone can't sell that. Olivier could sell it perfectly. I don't know who in modern times could. Stanley Tucci maybe or on an Uber meta level, Hugh Grant.", "As someone who read the novel but never saw the Hitchcock film, I really liked it. I thought Wheatley got the novel just right.\n\nThe first film must be amazing if people think this one is bad.", "I think this movie mostly suffers from unfavorable comparison to a masterpiece by a master director, both in its production and its reviews. The 1940 adaptation is my favorite Hitchcock (neck and neck with Vertigo), and Laurence Olivier is one of my favorite actors.\n\nI knew this was not going to compete and I adjusted my expectation accordingly. It's Lily James and Armie Hammer, for god's sake. Basically, a light and pretty period piece a la 2017 My Cousin Rachel or last year's Emma would've satisfied me, and this was quite good in that regard.\n\nAlso, Wheatley clearly clearly tried to avoid comparisons to Hitchcock so he went completely the opposite way instead. Focused on the romance rather than suspense. Depictions of internal ghosts (he tried anyway) rather than external things-that-go-bump.\n\nBut there's no escaping the comparison, poor guy. Anyone trying to remake Hitchcock (or in this case, adapting the same literary source) will always be found wanting. Remember talks of Fincher doing Strangers on a Train that went nowhere? It's a behemoth, thankless task.", "This was a movie I guess", "I think my biggest problem with this movie, is even from an adaptational standpoint, I feel like it misses the point. It wants us to believe that because the two leads have left Manderlay that they will be happier now that that sad tale is over, but in the book, you get the impression that they're never really happy afterwards, that they're trying to find Manderley again but failing. It just rubs me the wrong way, I think because it feels like such a modern spin of a story that has survived to this day because of it's unresolved and rather melancholic ending.", "I waited the whole movie to hear, \"I am Mrs. DeWinter now.\" And it never happened. :(", "Gutted to say as I'm a big Wheatley fan but this movie sucks hard.\n\nPros: nice mustard suit, trippy moments that are the specialty of the director that unfortunately go unexplored for the most part\n\nCons: literally everything else\n\nIf this is your first Wheatley film, I implore you watch Kill List as a palette cleanser.", "This adaptation was not up to the mark at all. The essence is Manderley. Only thing Maxim gave a shit about was Manderley, Rebecca and Maxim put up with each other because of Manderley. Our unnamed heroine who knew nothing about herself stepped up and protected Manderley. Now this movie ruined everything. ONLY GOOD THING :-  Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs. Danvers, hers were the only scenes that felt alive. Now what i hated the most was, the scene where our unnamed heroine who has been nothing but a shadow to people in her life, who felt burdened due to supremacy of Rebecca because she was nothing herself and Rebecca was so many things. The scene where she is supposed to wear the dress Rebecca wore was supposed to be the highlight, Maxim was supposed to feel like she saw a ghost and not just get angry. They brutally murdered that scene. \nThe next scene they murdered was burning of Manderley, instead of letting the fact of Manderley burning sink in, unnamed heroine runs off to get Mrs. Danvers lmao, that scene was pathetic. Manderley was supposed to be the hero ffs.\nAnother thing, Mrs. Danvers is a freaking badass she in no world would have had to commit suicide, that woman is too freaking strong for that. Hated they made her character do that.\nAlso also also the heroine is unnamed to maintain that balance of her being a naive young foolish girl was nothing but a shadow, who felt like she was not enough when compared to Rebecca, entire idea is to let this poor girl face all this and then shed herself to become the woman who is going to pick up the fight. Maxim and her were not in love, in the movie her last scene says how she knows what woman she is now but thing she cannot ever realize that because they lost Manderley and Maxim would not be the same ever.", "I struggle to believe Ben Wheatley directed this.

I think changing the mental genre of it makes it more palatable in a way.\n\nIts pretty, I like Lily James, but meh on other characters. The ending felt off, like rushed.

They had a lot on paper (Hathaway, Tucci, and Spencer are all top-flight actors) but none of it paid off.\n\n* Chris Rock was just super miscast. Rock is great in roles that fit Rock's style, but this was definitely not one. It altered the entire tone of the film from somewhat supernatural and creepy to Madagascar.\n* The location change. As soon as I saw an American flag in the opening slide show I was worried. The original story is a quintessentially English story by a quintessentially English author. The European setting alludes to an ancient history and folklore of witchcraft that explains both the witches existence and Grandma's inherited knowledge of them. That just isn't present in the United States. If the 2020 version had gone all-in on the voodoo thing, and made witches a product of voodoo, maybe it would have worked, but the Grand High Witch was still Norwegian and the witches themselves had nothing to do with voodoo at all; it was just an out-of-place trait of Grandma. \n* The racial aspect felt shoe-horned in as well. Grandma makes mention that witches target minorities because society doesn't care about them, which might have worked as a theme if they'd actually ran with it in a meaningful way. Instead the \"safety amongst rich white people\" theory is immediately and comically blown up by being the literal site of a coven meeting, and the witches openly target a wealthy English child under his parents' noses in blatant contravention of the \"they only go after children who won't be missed\" theory. The original story had nothing to do with race, and if you're going to make the story about that, you have to commit to it in a way that makes sense.\n* The mouth thing. Way too unsubtle, not amusing as a spectacle, don't know why they did it. In the original all of the signs of a witch are consciously hidden by the witch, except the purple eyes, which will only be spotted by those who know what they're looking for. In this version a bunch of women show up with glasgow smiles and no one thinks it's odd?\n* Why was the Grand High Witch the one who turned Grandma's friend? Are we to believe that this Norwegian super-witch has been hanging out in Alabama for 50 years? It being the same witch who approaches Hero/Luke would have made way more sense. Also the chicken was almost comical, and not nearly as creepy as a child who gets stuck in a painting who then ages and dies.\n* The witches in general felt off. In the original they were seductive but set off alarm bells that something wasn't quite right. In this they'd have you calling the FBI inside of five seconds. Also they're a bit overpowered, to the point where they wouldn't need schemes to kill children, they could just operate openly and kill anyone who objected.\n* The film replaced the Henson Company and Rowan Atkinson with obnoxious CGI and Tucci in a narrative straight jacket. Massive downgrades.\n* Kristin Chenoweth in absolutely no way reads like a child. She's 52 years old, and has always been 10 years sassier than her age. Claiming her character was a traumatized 10 year old child is farcical.\n\nI could go on, but it just didn't measure up to either expectations or to the 1990 version at all.", "You're a little girl.

Hathaways accent seemed to fluctuate at an insane rate, which could be explained away that shes a demon witch and doesn't quite understand how to speak like a human, but it was glaringly apparent. Her singular toes looked like hands flipping the bird when she was floating. The other witches might as well have been scenery props, they did absolutely nothing but sit there. The CGI was abysmal, which absolutely stupefied me because the sets and costumes were gorgeous yet the animations looked like a bad video game at points. And I hate to say it, but the kid actor was awful. Granted, his dialogue was just as horrible but I did not believe him for a second. I hate to harp on kid actors but Hill House and Stranger Things really set the bar for them these days. Talent was wasted, save for Octavia who still acted her ass off, she said I'm still getting paid, might as well act. Stanley Tucci was criminally underused. Hathaway seemed to actually have fun but came off as idiotic, shes supposed to be the Grand High Witch, not some bumbling idiot who stretches her arms slowly across a bed to kill the main character instead of, I dunno, lightning blasting them like she did hours earlier. This movie was painful to watch, and offensively so given that I love the source material so much. Roald is spinning in his grave. Also, what on earth was that postcard photoshop mess of an ending?? Spencer's head was literally shopped onto other photos.\n\nI did like a few very minor things they did with the story, like keeping the books ending and GHW not eating the soup and chasing them as a rat but the execution of these changes were awful.", "Anyone catch where the initial vial was stored?\n\n\u201cColder than a witch\u2019s tit\u201d", "The strong southern accent mouse caught me off guard right away, Kristin Chenoweth portraying a young mouse doesn\u2019t sound right.

The Grand High Witch's cat and the mice are the most glaring examples.  A cat couldn't have been trained to be on Anne's shoulder?\n\nFilm does have a \"family friendly\" filter on it, but Anne is terrifying, mainly in that meeting scene toward the end.\n\nIt's a good film, but, the 1990 film works better in many areas.", "Bleh, this movie just felt like a pile of nothing. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing outstanding. Plus this movie committed the cardinal sin of movies which is to waste Tucci Gang. He was in like two scenes and basically just there for Hathaway to bounce off and not given anything to do or play with.\n\nAnne Hathaway seems to be the only one having fun but even then her Eastern European schtick feels like it's been done a million times before. She's the only one embellishing while everyone else is pretty low key. For some reason the main kid's personality completely changes when he becomes a mouse. He goes from inward, depressed, shy to always has a plan, hand on the hip smirk. It's just all over the place.\n\nThe original movie isn't even a particularly great movie, it's just a little darker than your average kid's movie fare which made it memorable. When the kids turned to mice they violently shook like they were about to fall apart. When the witches took their wigs off they were hideous and I'm not going to sit here and say CGI is the death of cinema but you can really feel the lack of practical effects. It's just all so much less threatening and real.\n\nI guess it's kind of interesting that they went with the darker ending of the novel and never turned the kids back to kids. But even then the end just comes off as really insincere. It's some cobbled together lines about who you are on the inside and some morbid talk about how long until the kids die and it just doesn't mix well. \n\n5/10. Just wasn't much here. The pacing was weird and none of the performances seemed to know if they should be hamming or being serious. It's just kind of a boring mess tbh, if a perfectly capably made one.", "As a longtime fan of the book, going as far as writing a movie treatment a couple of years ago, this movie was heartbreaking. \nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to know why it seems Del Toro has some exclusive on every dark fantasy book there is. He\u2019s constantly acquiring rights left and right before abandoning them half cooked and leaving them in endless turnarounds until someone takes the job. I still can\u2019t wrap my head around seeing Cuaron among the producers.\n\n1)First of all; Nice change of setting, but apart from subtle racism and the Grandma tipping all the black workers at the end, this went absolutely nowhere. \nMaking the Grandma both Christian and inexplicably Voodoo Sorceress is setting up only the scene where she tries to revert the kids. You could remove any instance of her Voodoo knowledge and it wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Her health issue was another major misfire that didn\u2019t work either as a plot device or red herring. \nAnd her speech on numerology came out of absolutely nowhere except stating the obvious.\n\n2)The plot is riddled with way too many coincidences. Hero meets a Witch and Grandma just knows things, ready to dish everything out. It\u2019s not too different from the book, but it was handled better and if I recall correctly Grandma is constantly talking about Witches and other dangers until her nephew runs into one. And she begins to talk about them all the way to the hotel room. And, won\u2019t you believe it, the mice she gifted him just a couple days before, was a kid transformed by the Witches that is completely irrelevant to the plot or the witches demise.\nSo, Grandma is one of few who know about witches, buys a mouse who was turned by those witches and her nephew runs into a witch, so he takes him into a hotel that\u2019s unluckily full of witches. Again, the book already stretched this thin but the movie completely ripped this to shreds.\n\n3)The Grand High Witch. There is only one thing that\u2019s super important for the character. She is the oldest of the witches and the most powerful, the most demonic. Hence the face mask that hides her true face, because she is an extreme kind of witch. The Snake mouth design was fun to watch but it made her feel like any other witch. I have no idea why they removed the Mask thing but kept the scene with her looking into the mirror with glimpses of a rotten face. Why was she flying? Why was her dress a half living snake that didn\u2019t even come off? And don\u2019t get me started on the extremely slow extending arms. Anne Hathaway really picked a strange hill to die on. Her accent was fun and she is too to watch, but she just was in direct contrast with how her character should logically behave. A highly experienced witch that has been hiding and moving through the shadows of humanity ever since her birth. Yet she destroys half of the hotel and Stringer doesn\u2019t bat an eye when he probably finds the ballroom stage completely destroyed along with the podium. The witch that should be hiding the most is the one that seems to call any possible attention to herself. Even her CGI cat makes no sense. He climbs two floors to tell her there is a kid (in one of the largest hotels of the nation) but then just decides to fuck with her until she can eat her alive.\nWhich is why Huston\u2019s performance was better. Calmer, manipulative and barely breaking a sweat unless absolutely in control of the situation.\n\n4)I don\u2019t know what happened to Zemeckis but, apart from the constant bombardment of CG and needless search for spectacular sequences, he seems to have lost his storytelling touch. Plenty of sequences feel way too long, almost never cutting away from Hathaway making funny faces or over drawn gags that fall flat on their face. There is a moderate amount of bad taste that feels out of place; the chicken transformation scene (why did they pick the least imaginative of stories on the Witches\u2019 previous victims?) with mild body horror giving way to ridiculous CG (and Grandma telling how good her eggs were is just a cherry on top) the Grand High Witch demise and the overall shoddy handling of the most important theme in the story: Horrible things can happen but you can work out of them in the best of ways. This is a story that teaches children that death is real, that illness is real and pain is an important step to personal growth. All of these themes are worked out more or less in forced lines of dialogue whenever things need to wrap up. Hero suffers the loss of his parents, his grandma helps him out of it and that\u2019s the end of his journey. Turning into a mouse is irrelevant to the character, he\u2019s okay with it from the beginning and grandma too. The emotional dimension in this version is completely put aside in favor of moving the plot forward and it\u2019s the major misstep in this adaptation.\n\n5)The ending: Yes, it is more faithful than the 1990 version but everything feels so undeserved, it feels more like fan service than proper storytelling. The bombastic transformation aspects, with the blue sparks and people jumping into air was nice but, did nobody in production thought about having the Witches transform in a more private room, without staff members and every other guest? Women begin to explode a few tables ahead, but oh wait, let me stab these mice that have come out of nowhere and just forget about everything I\u2019ve just seen? It was nice to see the GHW escape from the soup trap, but the final confrontation is underwhelming. Grandma saw her not eating the soup but didn\u2019t think she was gonna walk to her room? And again, those lengthening arms make no sense for someone that can shoot lightning from her eyes. \nClosing the story on Hero being Old Chris Rock, complete with a white beard after just a couple of years is useless filler to get one last gag in, especially after the trouble of explaining in ludicrous detail how much Mouse Hero has probably left to live. The montage of terribly photoshopped photos with the \u201cWitch Hunters\u201d van was such an insane choice it nearly beat the insanity of sending those same children you want to protect from the Witches, after The Witches themselves.\nSorry for the long rant but this movie managed to fail on so many levels it gives an unprecedented shine and worth to the 1990 version.", "Anne Hathaway's accent in this movie is like a rollercoaster. \n\nIt's all over the damn place. I heard German, Russian, Scottish, and generic Eastern European.", "I guess the main problem when judging a movie like this is that you can't help but compare it to the original, which is still a very much remembered and beloved children's movie for those that grew up in the 90s. I suppose in the end it's a decently enjoyable children's movie for 2020 but I found it uninspired and really average.\n\nMy main issue is how bland it is in comparison.\n\n1. The Grand High Witch looks extremely watered down. Her iconic, monstrous look when unmasked is one of the things that made the original. In the new one, she really doesn't look different from the other witches at all. What's even worse is that we ACTUALLY get to see her \"true\" face looking very rotten and corpse like in a mirror reflection. Why the hell couldn't they use that instead for the convention scene/ending? I think the toothy grin was used to great effect when she first appears in Grandma's flashback smiling at her as she gives Alice candy, but after that eh...\n2. The Grand High Witch's personality is too hammy and cheesy. The problem with this is that she just ends up as comic relief instead of the more imposing, fierce and regal figure she was before. Nevermind the focus on showing her getting hurt for even more comedy effect through slapstick tier humor.\n3. The witches other than the GHW are largely unmemorable. Even though a lot of the background witches in the original were obviously men in dresses, the movie still devoted a lot of shots to show us some of the common witches, especially those who were seated at the front, with a big focus on their reactions to the GHW's speeches. The witch in black, Elsie, Nicola, the two old ladies who were at the very first row, the short haired witch etc. In the 2020 version, I can sincerely only recall the red haired one in green and the snake witch, but even then they barely have any sort of screentime/presence. The common witches are truly just background decoration here.\n4. Rather souless effects. I'm not against CGI, the problem is when it looks bland or outright bad. How come a movie from 30 years ago manages to have far more creative effects despite having the obvious limitations of practical effects over CGI? For example, when it comes to Bruno's or the witches' transformation into mice, they quite simply just shake a bit then shoot up to the ceiling and immediately turn into mice as some pink mist comes out. In the original we actually at the very least get to see their faces gaining mouse like features through believable make up, with each witch having a different focus, including the GHW's transformation being unique as well.\n5. Overall cheery atmosphere. This really kills it for me. The Chris Rock narration is way too cheesy. Gone are the grandma's somber warnings about witches in the beginning, and the infamous, unforgettable scene showing Erica's fate as she's kidnapped in broad daylight and trapped inside a painting for eternity. There's also barely any creepy/unsettling/suspense tunes and sound effects at all. Compare it to the original in scenes such as well the GHW arrives at the hotel and steps out of the car, when the witches are removing their gloves, shoes, wigs & the GHW is taking her mask off, when the witches are sniffing Luke out, when Luke is trying to get the potion... You can see how utterly satinized and \"safe\" they wanted to make it for children.\n6. The editing feels rather boring. I'm not sure how to put this into words as I'm not used to \"reviewing\" movies and what terms to use. Perhaps it's just me, but I found many scenes in the original to be a lot more dynamic, with more energetic cuts such as the Convention and the whole dinner sequence. They are a tad bland in this version, for example, when the GHW confronts grandma at her hotel room, it has nothing of the feel and emotion as when she reveals to everyone who the GDW is in the original as she's about to turn into a mouse.\n\nOverall I feel the only thing I definitely enjoyed over the first is that there's more comfy and warm Grandma x Boy moments, though it's a bit disappointing the Grandma here is never shown being sad that the Boy was turned into a mouse and all the consequences that would entail.", "the main kid become very talkative once he is turned in to a mouse", "What a weird episode of Everybody Hates Chris.", "I like a few elements - Octavia Spencer was delightful as the grandmother.

The zaniness and almost surrealist aspects translated really well to the screen in James and Giant Peach, which I think captured the overall tone and voice of Dahl better than any other movie, even though it didn't quite follow the plot. Obviously the original Willy Wonka film is great, though the humor is very different from Dahl's, and Matilda is a fine movie but didn't feel particularly like the book. \n\nOne of the best things about Dahl was that he truly understood children, something that Zemeckis clearly does not.\n\nAnyway I want an animated Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, I wish to see a vermicious knid.", "Anyone else find Anne Hathaway's CGI mouth to be unsettling?

Chris Rock sounded too zany when whimsy is the perfect tone for this type of movie. Hathaway just doesn\u2019t give good spooky. I really wish they cast Tilda Swinton or Cate Blanchet type in the role. \n\nUnlike some, I wasn\u2019t put off by the location change or race. If you include black characters you have to acknowledge the elephant in the room. The only way around that is to not have any black main characters and that seems wrong to me. \n\nLastly, the CGI was horrid. Why was the Grand High Witch floating? The creature design of the witches was underwhelming as well. They should\u2019ve looked more \u201cnormal\u201d when in disguise and more ghoulish out of disguise.

This one seemed to lack depth that the first one has, despite this one being longer than the 1990 version. They didn\u2019t do as much back story on the witches and it felt very rushed over/zero back story on any other witches. Even the story of Alice was not nearly as riveting as Erica being stuck in the portrait (they barely showed Alice\u2019s family reacting versus Erica who\u2019s dad had a haunting experience). The witch trying to give him a snake in the shop was not nearly as scary as the snake lady in the original. I don\u2019t need to go into the grand high witch performance, but obviously she wasn\u2019t as scary. The other witches just provided nothing to the story like in the original film. This was good but really kinda missed the mark for me.", "* The CGI was awful, they had to stick with practical effects.\n* Chris Rock was annoying, I cringed the minute he started narrating like a drunk homeless person.\n* Anne Hathaway was good enough despite her overacting.

Dumb idea.", "It was fun, and while not exactly like the other film, they did their own thing and had fun with it. \n\nWhile I missed the puppet mice, the cgi worked and the mice were cute.

The mice are singing and dancing to We Are Family. Are you kidding me? Also, the kids should be dead at the end because a huge part of the story is how the kid and the grandma would die at the same time because mice only live for about 9 years. What the hell happened to Robert Zemeckis? This guy directed Back to the Future and Forrest Gump and now he\u2019s doing this. Furthermore, I like Chris Rock, but he was an awful choice as the narrator because I couldn\u2019t take him seriously.\n\nThis movie was an insult to Dahl, the original Witches movie, and everyone who watched this.", "So, if Luke and Mary have babies, are they mice babies, or mice-person babies?

I know that is stupid, but this ending is so important and I am so glad they honored it.", "As a big fan of the original film growing up, I didn't have too much hope for this remake, and sadly that turned out to be right. It feels like it misses the horror aspect that the original film had. The practical effects of the original are what helped to make it so creepy. CGI will just never be as effective. The story of Erica from the original film chilled me as the child. Hell, I still get chills at the moment Erica disappears from the painting. Alice being turned into a chicken just felt more comedic than scary. I know I may be biased, and of course I'm an adult now, so maybe this film may be scarier for younger audiences.  \n  \nThe acting from the main cast was fine, and Anne Hathaway was over-the-top and hammy as the Grand High Witch, just like the original. I did think the witches looked okay, and quite liked the GHW's split mouth effect, which did make her look a little creepier in some shots (although I still wish they had gone a little more extreme with her design), but everything else just missed the mark for me. The only real thing that I liked about this version was that >!they kept the original book ending and didn't cop out with a sappy feel good ending like the original film.!<  \n  \n4/10 for me.", "The most annoying scene to me was in the finale, there all this tension when GHW enters the room and it\u2019s like ooooh no, what\u2019s she\u2019s going to do, just for her to rip the headboard away from the person she\u2019s trying to kill and instead opt to use her slow contorting hands . Like ma\u2019am, wtf is that logic? That and the sudden shift in Hero\u2019s personality and other issues makes this a 5/10 for me", "This was just not an improvement.  The CGI is like television commercial grade.  We watched the original earlier this week and the mouses looked 10x better.  I also saw no reason why they needed to make the other mouse a shrunk kid?  Basically had nothing to add to the story.  Also her and Bruno make no appearance later on at the end?  \n\nI know the kid staying a mouse in the original book, but I think it was a little more poignant in the too, about them dying together and it ends there.\n\nOther minor complaints, didn't like the split mouth/joker mouth look, and the two finger claws were weird. The Grand High Witch was amazing in the original and just meh in this.  Also Alabama?  If you want to set it in the south fine, but just New Orleans would've probably made more sense, I don't see Alabama as a place the Grand High Witch was hanging out at all the time.", "Being a huge fan of the original , I really didn't like that they saturated the witches with CGI.\n\nI know that remakes are remakes and are not meant to be like the original, more of a tribute, but being that they hardly held on to the story of the original, this is one thing they could have held on to.\n\nAne Hathaway did a good job in my opinion. \n\nMy biggest dislikes are the lack of excitement within the entire plot and that the main. Characters\n\nI wouldn't recommend or rewatch. Wish I wouldn't have watched it.", "Hathaway is clearly having fun, but she's nowhere near as terrifying or memorable in the role as Angelica Huston. Just compare the Snapchat filter effect on the witches' faces vs. the Jim Henson Workshop makeup.\n\nWhat was the point of setting this in the American South? There are some hints of racism here and there, but it never really factors into the plot in an interesting way.", "Death Becomes Her is one of my favourite movies. The story, directing, performances, sets, wardrobe, sfx, score, editing, dialogue, pacing, casting; everything about it is so insync and brilliant.\n\nI am gobsmacked that the same director and composer together again can make something so lackluster, forgettable and disappointing. \n\nThe score is cheesy, redundant and cookie cutter. It sounds like stock music. The only interesting part is the opening creepy melody which is used again for the GHW. However, this sounds like a ripoff of Christopher Young's score for The Grudge. \n\nThe soundtrack was too jam packed with songs aswell. It comes off uninspired and a lazy attempt to inject some life into a scene. \n\nThe biggest crime: there are literally no \"scary scenes\" in what should be a family friendly horror movie. \n\nAnne's \"performance\" never leaves goofball territory and the inclusion of slapstick violence and the Borat-style intentionally unintelligible accent to the Grand High Witch takes away any threat she might have had. Anne was miscast (or at least misdirected). The GHW getting hurt constantly makes her seem like roadrunner. Absolutely no authority. \n\nThe choice to take away the full monstrous reveal and replace it with flying and throwing furniture was a bad, awful, terrible choice. It should have been MORE terrifying, not less. \n\nThe character choices for the GHW were also  misguided. She is meant to appear beautiful and charming. She's supposed to manipulate the hotel manager to get what she wants. \"The most dangerous thing about her is SHE DOESN'T LOOK DANGEROUS\". This movie depicts the GHW as a temper-tantrum brat with absolutely no subtly or maturity at all. That goes for all the witches for that matter, \"mmm I wonder why all these women have joker scars?\". Witches are supposed to be unnerving because they look like sweet ladies until you get too close and can spot their eyes. \n\nThe creature design of the witches is unoriginal and forgettable. My niece described it as looking like \"a bad snapchat filter\". \n\nThe bald heads, the scars, the big mouth, the strange 3 fingers, the goofy giant nostrils. None of it compliments each other. The regular witches have too much going on and the GHW hasn't enough. (Also, why does the GHW have middle toes?) \n\nThe GHW's ability to lengthen her arms is so stupid, not only as a visual effect but as a threat. Especially when she already has lazer beam eyes. \n\nThe other witches in the coven are the most lackluster and stiff bunch, it's mindblogging. Rewatch the conference room scene and focus on the seated witches. They barely react to anything. Such bad extras when compared to the 1990 scene (all of whom are having a great time and seem filled with personality).  The 2020 version doesn't focus on any of the other witches apart from the snake lady at the start and the lady on door duty. Both of which are done SO MUCH BETTER in the 1990 film. \n\nEven the choice to have them applaud by clicking their fingers together is bizarre (was this is reference to the gay community?  I've been to drag shows and the audience applauded with similar finger snaps)\n\nThe choice to have the witches walk and behave in militant unison, which is also reflected in the score, was so out of place. \n\nThe Chris Rock narration is painful and takes any tension out of scenes. The entire old mouse element seemed tacked on and added as an afterthought to lighten the mood to give a \"happy ending\" while still keeping the original \"dark ending\" in post production. \n\nAside from the obvious comparison of the GHW. The biggest example of success verses failure is the story of Erica. The 1990 version is truly unsettling and haunting. It opens the film and sets the tone. It introduces us to, and eases us into, the world of witches. It takes place in Norway so it adds to the fact that witches are a global threat. It takes its time, let's us know Erica before slowly delving into horror. It has a bitter, sad ending. It works as a standalone tale and stays with the audience long after viewing. \n\nIn the 2020 version the girl is introduced seconds before she meets the witch. The focus is on the grandma. It is set in America too. The fact the witch is the GHW seems forced and unnecessary. The transformation into a chicken is played for laughs. (I did foolishly think the story was going to end with the family eating the chicken, which is where the setup seemed to be going). \n\nThere were a few moments I DID enjoy:\n\nGHW smelling the boy right away in the conference room (however, I wish she dismissed her suspicion for different reasons. She could have shown her disgust as soon as she entered the hotel at the smell, and enquired if there were many children staying at the moment. The manager says yes it's the summer holidays. That sets up why the hotel stinks and why she'd dismiss the smell in the room). \n\nGHW commending the witch's question after just killing her (however this whole part is so bad compared to the 1990 version overall).\n\nGHW retching while counting down to Bruno's transformation\n\nGHW asking which soup is cheaper (For some reason that got a chuckle out of me) \n\nThe car crash spinning reveal shot. \n\nEdit: I also liked that they included a few men as bald witches in the conference scene as a homage to the 1990 film. \n\nI don't think there is anything else I enjoyed. \n\nThe 1990 film will be remembered. The 2020 film will not.", "The only positive thing for me was the fact that CGI mice do emote better and that aspect was the improvement over the original faux-taxidermy puppets.\n\nEverything else seemed sapped of life. And am I the only one who missed the \u201cgood witch\u201d character from the original? For some reason, the way that there was no distinct (unlike the 1990 film) witch character aside from the Grand High Witch made everything flat AF.", "I kept expecting Anne Hathaway to say, \u201cMoose and squirrel!\u201d\n\nOverall, I didn\u2019t hate it, but it just made me want to watch the previous film.", "I wasn\u2019t a big fan of Hathaway\u2019s performance. She didn\u2019t feel like the villain at all in the story. In every scene, it seemed like she was always the one getting dumped on, not the villain in control of the situation. I know she\u2019s a great actor, but her accent was a bit off putting.\n\nThe CGI was also excessive. They couldn\u2019t just get real animals, like a snake and cat in the movie? Cmon.", "Just finished watching it, and let me just say this movie was incredibly disappointing. It had all the right pieces to be good. Decent actors, Roald Dahl story, decent producers, etc. but in this case the whole equaled less than the parts.\n\nMy main points of contention are: \n\n**SPOILERS BELOW- on mobile can\u2019t be bothered to use the blackout**\n\nIt was boring. There were scenes of excitement but I didn\u2019t feel anything during them. I was not happy or sad or anything beyond meh the entire time.\n\n\n**Look**\n\nCGI is not good in this. This is some 1998 Stuart Little stuff. The witches mouths were the only decent looking CG, and even that was nothing to write home about. At no point was I impressed by anything I saw in this film.\n\nIn addition to that, the art direction was non existent. Hathaway\u2019s costumes were a bit of a saving grace, but the entire look of the film was bleh. Just there. Nothing striking, nothing intriguing, just bleh.\n\n**Acting**\n\nAnne Hathaway could have been golden in this, but they made a poor choice in going with the accent imo. I know that in the book the witch is Norwegian, but it really would have played better if they had just let her use her normal voice with the rasp for witch mouth. Instead, her accent slips, breaks, twists, drops, and every other synonym for not being done well that there is. It was a pointless addition to this version of the story and only detracted from it.\n\nI like Kristin Chenoweth, but she shouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near this roll. My immediate thought was \u201coh she\u2019s been a mouse for 40 years already\u201d. Nope, she got turned last month and is still a kid. Her voice doesn\u2019t match childhood anymore.\n\n\nThe other actors were fine, stilted performances, but whatever. Half of them were kids, and the other half were doing what they could with it.\n\n**Plot**\n\nOk so, there\u2019s a bunch but I\u2019m gonna focus on just a few things.\n\nAt no point are the witch\u2019s intentions really made clear or interesting. Kids smell like dog poop, and they might be demons in human clothes.\n\n... Kay? Like what\u2019s the point. Kill everyone then. Big humans make little humans so just get rid of all of them. (It\u2019s a kids book, I know.)\n\nAt one point Granny says (paraphrasing) \u201conce you meet a witch they\u2019ll pursue you until they get you. Naturally my thought was \u201cokay, little dude ran into a witch at the market, so they\u2019re gonna come for him now that he got away. Terminator styles.\u201d\nNOPE.\nThe gaggle of gals shows up at the hotel completely independently of that and it\u2019s never brought up again until Hathaway is like \u201cyou escaped me once didn\u2019t you?\u201d Which is some bullshit because baby Octavia was literally walking home one day, and just happened to look to her left. Wasn\u2019t an escape at all, and I\u2019d say barely counted as an interaction.\n\nSpeaking of dropped plot points here\u2019s one! I legit thought that granny had cancer with all her coughing. At the market she looks in her hanky and (I assumed) saw blood. That cough continues very pervasively throughout the film, and then it\u2019s gone. Now apparently in the book she has Pneumonia, but that isn\u2019t made clear at all in the film. So I think to myself, \u201cwell the witches must have bad air around them\u201d, but that\u2019s headcannon stuff because it\u2019s never mentioned or hinted at. She had a cough then she doesn\u2019t. End of plot point.\n\nMy final criticism of the film might ruffle some feathers, but I think it\u2019s worth mentioning due to how it was handled in the film. Basically it has to do with the race factor of the film. I\u2019m all for diversity in film, and don\u2019t mind when color swaps happen for characters. Don\u2019t care at all. New Little Mermaid can rock on, give me a tan skinned Snow White, whatever. Don\u2019t care.\n\nHowever, the racial components of this film felt shoehorned in, and just... lazy. It starts off with an explanation that poor kids (black kids) are hunted by witches because they won\u2019t be missed as much as rich kids (white kids). Grandma is also a voodoo priestess instead of a retired witch hunter like in the book. Then 20 minutes later race is no longer an issue... in 1968... in Alabama... in a VERY white hotel. The only time it\u2019s even kind of brought up again when she tries to heal the kids which is a throw away scene anyway.\n\nAs I mentioned it just felt lazy to me. The story was adjusted *just* enough so that the characters could be of color, but there was no substance there. There was no heart in that decision. It felt like an executive trying to appease a call for diversity, but they still don\u2019t understand what that means. Representation matters, but if you shoehorn in POC into poorly written films you\u2019re not doing justice to those people or to the film.\n\nNow I am not a person of color, so perhaps I\u2019m white knighting this too much. However, just based on the story alone, I\u2019d be unhappy if the rolls were reversed. People of color, and children of color, deserved a better and more representative story than the one that they got. Again, I realize that I\u2019m coming at this from an odd angle, so if there is a discussion to be had here then I am happy to listen and reevaluate my viewpoint.\n\nAll in all, the movie just didn\u2019t work. I wish it did, but it didn\u2019t. The best part of this movie was talking to my gf afterward and picking it apart. I\u2019m happy that I watched it because I like talking to her, but I will most likely never watch it again.\n\n*edited some grammar and formatting", "Hated it. Those mouth scars were far too messy and distracting. Mr Stringer/Bean is supposed to be captivated by The GHW but she's too scar-faced and rude without being alluring, so I'm not sure why he would bend to her every whim. CGI was so bad -- like Harry Potter 1 bad. I get that they wanted to change the locale to Alabama, but it was inconsistent-- why would Bruno's upper class British family go to Alabama? Hathaway seemed to be enjoying herself in a campy way but it just made me miss Angelica Huston's more subdued and regal version. And at the end all the schoolchildren are shocked to learn that there are witches out there but they're totally fine with a talking mouse working a film projector? Just because they stayed true to the book's ending and left the kid as a mouse, doesn't mean the movie needed to be remade. And just call him Luke, no one needs some metaphorical \"Hero\" classification. Waste of time all around.", "Were the writers on drugs?\n\nDoes the book end the same way?\n\nThey stay mice forever?!\n\nAND the fat kids parents aren't mice people so they don't want him anymore?????????\n\nAND \"you'll easily live three times that!\" \"oh good so we'll get old and die together\"\n\n??????????????????????????????????\n\nSeriously what kind of drugs were these people on?", "I have a theory that most movies with a voice over narrator could be massively improved if you just muted the narrator's track. Can I have a Chris Rock-less cut of this movie?", "The narration voice and the not-so-terrifying Grand High witch make up completely ruined it for me.\n\nOctavia Davis was great, though.", "As someone who grew up reading the book I liked it, but the original is still far superior. For the most part, I liked some of the changes to the story. However, I feel like the Daisy/Mary mouse came off incredibly forced and was only added so they could have a female kid turned as well. Plus having her save both the boy and Bruno from getting killed by the witches was a little much. I also felt the conference scene came off somewhat rushed compared to the original movie which I felt took its time and built up tension to the main character\u2019s transformation. Also, I know it\u2019s a kids movie, but I wish they went a little into detail on why when the girl was turned into a chicken, she became an actual chicken while the children turned into mice were able to keep their personalities and voices.", "Sigh. This is going to be long, due to my love of Roald Dahl's work, and how bad this movie is, even in comparison to some of the other weaker adaptations. Yes, Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was very Tim Burton, but it was at least interesting. The plot deviations from the original novel were very drastic, but they worked in their own way. Exploring the darker and child-like elements of Willy Wonka's character was definitely a decision that I can respect. Some of those were touched on by Gene Wilder as well, but in a different way, fitting a more clearly child-friendly film.\n\nWhat a waste of Anne Hathaway, and the entirety of the cast. Multiple Academy Award winners, and so many nominations among them. Just a travesty. The performances were good, but there is only so much an actor to do, and that can't salvage a movie like this.\n\nNot to mention Robert Zemeckis. Robert, what happened to you? How does someone who is so decorated and directed all the Back to the Future movies and Forrest Gump end up in this career slump? No, that feels like too generous a description of what an embarrassment his recent work is.\n\nNone of these criticisms are a slight against children's films. There are many that I love and still watch (I am 25). This was an opportunity to make an interesting and suspenseful movie for kids that don't know the source material and maybe would be introduced to reading more of Roald Dahl than just Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda (which is not a slight against those movies either, Gene Wilder and Mara Wilson are just phenomenal, and those are good movies). Matilda had the kid friendly stuff as well as the darker overtones, which felt like a reasonable way\n\nGoing in, I did not actually think it would be that bad. Plot-wise, the moments of suspense were wastes of time, and just felt like they were padding out the runtime. What was the point of the final confrontation with the Grand High Witch? Nothing interesting happened, nothing about it mattered plot-wise, like the Grand High Witch catching them stealing the potion the first time, then look at that, she had to go answer the door.  It was just padding.\n\nSome of the characters took me out of the story as well, specifically Bruno. He was just so endlessly stupid, to the point of contrivance for the sake of being silly. How much of what did/could have gone wrong was due to his sheer stupidity and gluttony? Not talking to his parents because he was eating. Not freaking out when the witches barricaded the door shut. Constantly endangering himself and the other rats by trying to get food and revealing themselves. It just continued to take me out of the film, and felt even sillier than casting James Cordon as Peter Rabbit.\n\nThe ending was also an insult. In the novel, the grandmother was even older and in worse health, yet she chose to use the resources of the money-printing machine to go and eradicate the witches. Mentioning the tragic truth that the kids would die young due to being mice was much too dark for the tone this movie set, and just doesn't work because of it. That musical ending montage further twists the knife and firmly cements that this novel was misappropriated and degraded for this pablum. Roald Dahl deserves better. The audience deserved better. The cast deserved to be in a good movie.", "The directing was bad, felt very amateurish. The editing and scene timing was also not very good.   \nIt felt like an alien with no experience with comedy was trying to make a comedy film. Like when the witch is asking what the manager would do if there were rats in the hotel, and she turns around and says \"he will exterminate those brats!\", and he leans over and says \"rats\"....the pacing was just so flat. It wasn't funny. It was just awkward.", "Everytime I say \"garlic\", i'll be thinking in my head \"*Goorrrrrrrlic.*\"", "If I had that kind of money and a list of people I needed taken out, instead of recruiting kids to turn them all into mice, I'd just hire some badass international assassin.", "2 questions;\n\n* Is this as good as the original?\n\n* Was Hathaway as good as Huston?", "What was the whole beginning part about? The rat grew old and taught a classroom full of kids about witches? I was waiting for them to tie that in but they never did \ud83d\ude14", "So about as bad as expected", "I watched it with my 12 yr old - the target audience and she enjoyed it.", "Damn...I liked it lol", "I thought it was fun enough. Octavia Spencer is always a delight, Anne Hathaway looked like she was having a lot of fun, and I'll never not enjoy an appearance from Stanely Tucci. Kids will probably enjoy watching this around Halloween.\n\nBut unlike the book or the 1990 movie, I won't really every think about this again. It was fairly entertaining but not memorable.\n\nAlso, while I generally really like Chris Rock and Kristen Chenoweth, holy crap, they really shouldn't have been in this. Chris Rock narrating was distracting as hell and Kristen Chenoweth has no business voicing a child lol.", "Id really like it if directors stopped trying to make Anne Hathaway do accents. She\u2019s shown multiple times now that she can\u2019t do accents to save her life. In one word, she\u2019d be a generic Eastern European vampire and Scottish in the next. Just please make it stop already.", "This actually came out more tame (and shocker, less interesting) than the original.", "Sounds stupid but why are the cast americans it should all based in the uk not america it's just something that's really annoyed me", "Anne Hathaways attitude and overacting in this movie kills the whole thing for me. I can't say who the target audience for this film should be either.\n\nIt's way too dark and scary for young kids and for adults the story and dialogues are too clumsy and annoying.\n\nThen there is a scene in which parents no longer want to accept their child because it has turned into a mouse. Actually tragic, but everything dissolves within seconds and the audience should accept that?\n\nIf the film had come to the cinema regularly, we would certainly have expected a huge flop.", "Was anyone else hooked for like the first 2/3 of the movie? \n\nI actually just watched the 1990 version for the first time on Wednesday followed by the new version last night. Loved the original version. I do think movies like The Witches, Gremlins, Hocus Pocus get a lot of leeway for things that wouldn\u2019t fly now. It\u2019s primarily due to the well developed tones and acting in the movies. They\u2019re silly without feeling like a modern silly (Disney Channel movies, etc). \n\nThe original movie did the creature effects more successfully than the new one. They excelled at the Jim Henson puppetry while the creature effects on the new movie were inconsistent and not all that special.\n\nI was completely satisfied with the movie until we got to that third act. I enjoyed the pre-hotel scenes and thought Octavia Spencer brought a freshness to the grandma character. This was much needed considering the story was almost identical. I also enjoyed most of the hotel scenes for what they were prior to the dining room scene. I think the story fell off the rails in the final act.", "When the girl turned into a chicken in front of my own eyes, that was the signal I was in for something that I was not quite prepared for", "To be honest, I rather liked this. Yes, the 1990 film is superior, but I still liked this quite a bit. Loved the performances, the visuals are reasonably splendid, and Alan Silvestri once again provides a beautiful score.", ">!hathaway was hot as fuck in this, and i do mean the bald witch monster form. she can torture me any day.!<", "It's was alright. I didn't read the book so I wasn't aware that the ending was faithful, which I found a bit sad. Bruno's parents were as despicable as the witches.", "well, as someone who has never seen the original movie and isnt familiar with the story, this movie scared me ngl lol. i thought anne hathaway was delightful and she really freaked me out when she turned into a monstrous predator, but it was a lot of fun! also, octavia spencer was very charming\n\nthe cgi for the mice wasn\u2019t astounding but it was fine in my opinion, and i really don\u2019t care about how cgi looks anyway. i did think the effects on the witches were good... the smile disturbed me every time\n\nmy criticisms are that bruno was annoying, and that the dance party at the end was stupid", "Even with low expectations I was still shocked at how bad this was. I hope disney doesn't acquire the Neverending Story.", "I\u2019m still wondering how Zemeckid went from Back to the Future to....this", "Just watched it. It was like a reread of the book, mixed with a little bit of Everybody Hates Chris, 1960s set and Anne Hathaway slaying in the best costumes I've seen in a while. Octavia Spencer is a national treasure and made me take the situation seriously. What I really liked about this movie is they didn't cheap out on animation... instead of having 90 minutes of animated hijinks they padded out the rest of the movie with character development, an interesting take and I hope more movies follow suit.", "I swear...When it comes to remakes, filmmakers today just seem to f that shit up more often than not....Maybe I'm expecting too much, but damn...They just don\u2019t retain the same magic from the time frame of it's predecessors and I think that's the main problem. I also can't stand when they \"selfishly\" change aspects of a story most people are used to, but it IS just an adaptation, overall...Anyways, here's what I thought...\n\nI was really looking forward to seeing Anne Hathaway\u2019s portrayal as the GHW prior, but was kind of disappointed..She was just....\u201dokay\u201d....but a little over the top...Also, really? They put Chris Rock in this?...WHY?! \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f...

Then again, it\u2019s been a shitty year so far, but still....You\u2019re adapting a beloved book/film here, people...I think you might want to try a little bit f\u2019ing harder than that...I still love the look of Anjelica\u2019s Huston\u2019s GHW  from the 90\u2019s film with the use of prosthetic make up. She even looks WAAAAAAAY more intimidating/ creepy than Hatthaway did with just a lame CGI extended mouth. Seriously?!  With the kind of technology we have today, they couldn't have done anymore to change her look utter than that?! FAIL!!!....and WTF was with that scene where she's sniffing for the human boy with that incredibly fake-looking elongated nose? Could you have made that look anymore cartoon-y?!! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f ...I don\u2019t have to tell you about how impractical the mice looked either....Way to NOT suspend my disbelief and take me out of the film, CONSTANTLY, guys...\n\nOverall, I thought this movie was really disappointing for movies that I\u2019ve been anticipating for. The 90's film is still #1", "rly bad. i cant watch the whole thing. the fat kid/rat is also extremely unlikeable.", "My script doctor fix for this movie\n\n\\-Lose Bruno immediately. Dahl had a weird thing where there was always a fat english eating chocolate kid in every movie, but he just takes up way too much time and doesn't do anything. Heck if you want the homage, just film the 2 minutes of him turning into the mouse and being the first victim. And you know..kill him off (or if that's too much, do it off screen Wonka style)\n\n\\- Kristin Chenoweth's character is Alice, not some random ass kid that no one cares about. Grandma has been into voodoo for some time and Alice and her are a non-traditional family. Alice reveals her ability to talk the day the Boy encounters his first wish. She can be a chicken or a mouse, there's always comedy in a talking chicken.\n\n\\-Time jump right before Boy and Grandma stay at the hotel. Boy turns 14-15, and Chris Rock takes over as his voice. OR, after he turns into a mouse, he sounds like Chris Rock.\n\n\\-Lose Anne's weird European whatever character. Instead have her turn up charm to 11 and make her Evil Ella Enchanted.  The Grand High Witch is the Ultimate Karen. Honestly her character would be much creepier if Anne was really nice and then you know, suddenly weird claws and eating kids and shit.

Black Luke is almost bitten by the snake and runs away as anyone would. Doesnt really help further what we already know about the witches.\n\nLuke in the original hops table to table ducks under legs and escapes the witches in the conference room. So he transposes well into a mouse. Black Luke never shows us he is athletic at all. He is suddenly a nimble mouse.\n\nWhen the GHW didn't drink the potion I was in for a treat.

And when they are confronted with this freaking strange foreigner, they accept him without question as one of their own. Not only that but they go out of their way to help him in any way they can. \n\nNone of this would have been possible without the two lead roles, Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova.

They took him into their home and helped him even if what he was doing might be weird or different. And then he shows the black woman (I assumed is liberal) who was very kind and open and not judgemental.

It was the perfect distraction from everything going on in the world. I wasn't sure how a Borat film would work in 2020, but the idea of Tutar being the emotional linchpin was just perfect. Maria Bakalova was absolutely amazing and made me care about the character so much. She also had some of the craziest, most fearless scenes I've seen (the \"blood moon\" dance, the masturbation speech and of course the interview encounter).\n\nRegarding \"that\" scene, I have to say from an objective perspective, it did seem like Rudy was just tucking his shirt into his pants. His hand did linger for an uncomfortable length of time, but there was no indication he was jerkin' his gherkin. I'm not a supporter of his or anything, but I think Sacha probably busted in too soon (probably out of concern for the actress). A few extra moments might have been even more incriminating. On the surface alone, it did seem like Tutar was flirting with him and apparently he wanted her address and number; nothing to really indicate he was expecting anything to happen then and there. But it was a shocking scene in and of itself (wish it hadn't been over-reported before I got a chance to see it, as I knew exactly what to expect).\n\nRegarding the plot twist at the end, >!the idea that Borat is patient zero for COVID is plain brilliant. I never saw it coming and it makes complete sense in retrospect (his boat journey around the world, kissing everybody's cheeks and that great Tom Hanks cameo). I was worried centering around the virus would date the movie or make it seem like an out of place detail, but this really cements it as its own mythology.!<\n\nSpeaking of being filmed during COVID, I almost felt uncomfortable in scenes which included close contact with others. I guess this was made during the early days (before quarantine was enforced), but it made me wonder about how certain scenes were shot. In particular, the character of the black woman babysitter and the two redneck guys who take Borat in for a few days. I'm wondering how this was pulled off and whether they were informed of what was going on in any way (especially how it's shot from so many angles, were they aware of the cameras the whole time?). Some of the dialogue is so important and integral to the plot of the movie, surely it's not a coincidence? Just like the scene with the two Jewish women in the church, where it was revealed in interviews that the women was informed of what the movie was about (RIP).\n\nIn conclusion, the movie was great success. Sacha Baron Cohen is amazing as always, and Maria Bakalova is clearly the breakout star. Also, I didn't mind that Borat's character grew here, whereas in the first movie, he learned nothing from his journey to America. It didn't come off as preachy or over-the-top, it was actually a really sweet movie about a father and daughter in disguise.", "That old black lady was so sweet", "Not quite as shocking as the first one, but it had a lot of the same umcomfortable and hilarious at the same time moments.\n\nMaria Bakalova is the star of the movie.

Whereas this, following on from several subsequent (and very, very good) dramatic roles, seems to mirror his evolution from such and promote more on the knowledge, confidence in the craft he has now gained to produce a narrative and performative screen presence. The movie is remarkably even better than the first because of this. If the first used heart to serve the comedy, the second uses comedy to serve the heart. It, and he, is fucking remarkable, frankly. And he has balls the size of planets. Huge, monstrous, fearless fucking balls.\n\nIt is going to take a few more watches to appreciate it all (again, because of the sketch format of the first, it had an immediacy to that one), but this dude is something unique and we should be grateful for the side of *the* argument he falls on.", "The movie wasn't quite the grand piece of work the original was\n\nBut hey, shoutout to all the random triggered 'conservatives' in here thinly disguising their criticisms as genuine movie reviews when in fact they just want to rage against the film for making fun of so many goons they idolize", "Were the 2 Qanon dudes just actors?

Knowing there really are Trump rallies with people throwing up Nazi salutes, and people who believe every QAnon conspiracy theory, it's a little chilling and scary.\n\nThat being said, this movie was an incredibly solid sequel. More scripted portions, less improv, but still very funny. Bakalova deserves every bit of praise she will inevitably receive for this movie.

From the infectious music to the surreal choreography to the crowd reactions (sometimes the camera itself take the perspective of an audience member), you can feel so much joy and energy within the movie. I also loved the way it highlights each background performer, making it feel less like they're a bunch of disparate props but an actual community of people who are working together and with Byrne. The movie does have some emotional but necessary moments, specifically a cover of Janelle Manoe's Hell You Talmbout, that adds to Byrne's (and Lee's) plea to create an American utopia, where people are able to truly connect and empathize with each other.\n\n>It's my favourite Spike Lee film of the year and amongst his best ever.", "Just watched it, amazing film.

I didn't love the banter in-between songs (they didn't really make the gig flow, with one or two exceptions) but it's nothing that made it worse. The performance of Janelle Monae's \"Hell You Talmbout\" was powerful, with pictures of the people mentioned in the lyrics being shown on screen.\n\nThe only thing that disappointed me was the fact that a few songs were abridged, such as \"Everyday Is A Miracle\" (a whole verse and chorus were cut).

I really like the speaking sections which gently guided the narrative.\n\nI was fortunate enough to watch the film as part of the London Film Festival and there was a recorded interview with David before they showed the film. He talked about how he wasn't there to preach, rather show than tell. Seeing a diverse group of people create something wonderful and joyful was the message.\n\nAlso, David said you were meant to experience it as though you were in the audience or on the stage, that it was the real thing.\n\nSo, I thought the section with big red writing and all the photos was jarring. It went against the subtlety of the rest of performance. The music behind it was beautiful, and I think it would have been just as powerful without. The song's lyrics were \"say his name\", or \"say her name\". We didn't need to show their face. It was incongruous with the lyrics and the rest of the show. They also added George Floyd who had died since the performance, and wasn't named in the song. There's nothing wrong with that per se, but it felt unnecessary. If they were adding to the names to make it more current, or to tap into the present feeling, I don't think that was needed. It's a powerful song as it is, and I wonder whether it diminishes it.\n\nThe sound they all make together is really great, the sound crew did an amazing job.\n\nAlso, I love it whenever David picks up a guitar.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the film.

I wished there was more horror, but really early on in the movie I began to realize that he movie was less about werewolves versus cops, and more about the effects of rage, uncontrolled anger, anxiety, and stress; and what those things can do to a person. \n\nThe werewolf merely serves as a focal point throughout the movie, but the movie is about a man breaking down and becoming acutely aware of his own imploding behavior. he knows he is lashing out, and yet believes he is powerless to stop it. He is at his wit's end, and all he has left is lashing out at others to stay afloat. You can draw parallels between his self-destructive behavior and that of the very werewolf of mythology.\n\nJust a man who is it the edge of a precipice, struggling to keep from falling in as the world around him pushes and pushes. Like a werewolf, he is one simple trigger (A full moon // his daughter's boyfriend) from losing himself to rage, snapping, and doing something ultimately very regrettable that cannot be undone and will have lasting consequences. \n\nViewed through the lens of a horror monster movie, I found it somewhat lacking. Viewed through the lens of a character study, it was fascinating to see the parallels and mechanisms at work, and I'm glad that it ended the way it did; with hope that the character has pulled back from the edge, and that he is no longer just a trigger away (the college boys talking about fresh meat) from doing something regrettable. He has not beaten his Lycanthropy, but rather has learned to control it, and not be controlled by it.\n\nLoved it.

As with most apocalypse and dystopian stuff, at first you kind of expect everyone to be at each others throats.  Constant backstabbing and screwing one another over and I really liked that this didn't go for that.  His whole bunker family loved him despite his flaws and lack of survivor skills.  Minnow and Clyde rescue him and help him go west without even hesitating and they all seem to enjoy one another.  Even the plot with 'Aimee With One I and Two E's', there was a bit of predictability there, you knew it wasn't going to be clean cut and she was not telling him everything but he immediately seemed to understand that he didn't even ask her how she felt and that was his fault, not hers.  Of course the yacht crew still offers some element of human danger and people being the enemy but it wasn't the focus and I love that they called back to him being a food thief, 'that's right, I'm a food thief!' got an audible laugh out of me.  Overall a really fun movie and one I would recommend.  \n  \nAlso, loved the touch of him wearing a red jacket at the end to symbolize Jack is Boy's new owner.", "This is what I thought Monster Hunter was going to be.", "Dylan really kept that thing together on his own, charismatic dude, the movie is fun but he elevated it to a good degree, i was mainly watching because of him.\n\nWonderful actor, should be in more stuff.", "Fun movie, I'm annoyed that we never got to see Boy's Owner. I thought the red dress and all had a bigger role to play :\\\\", "This movie needs a sequel. I mean it doesn't need it, it's wonderful as is.... but dang I wanna see some Snow Spiders!!", "That might be legit the smartest dog in a movie ever. Ridiculously aware and (mostly) obedient; honestly felt like the most unrealistic part of the movie because of how amazing he was.\n\nThe breakup between the Joel and Boy seemed a little sudden though. Yeah the river thing happened, but before that they had a perfectly strong bond and after just the one mistake, Joel explodes like their entire journey was filled with tension. Also what happened to the shirt that Boy was carrying with him? Did he just lose it at the end after all that?\n\nMav1s scene was easily the highlight of the movie. Gave a lot warmth and heart to the movie that balanced the almost levity of the movie up to that point. You know a movie's really trying to play on your emotions when they bust out Stand by Me.\n\nI think I liked Zombieland 2 better than most, but this felt like more of a true spiritual successor to Zombieland than its actual sequel.", "My only complaint is that the Australian yacht captain felt very undercooked, like he stepped off a CW set to appear in this for a little bit. Other than that very surprising and satisfying character development that feels earned", "Wow, out of left field, and one of the best movies of the year.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about this movie was none of the female cast ended up being plot devices or \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d characters.

I didn't know what to expect going in and from the start I was hooked!", "Very good film. One of the best dog characters I've seen in some time.\n\nI will say that the romance aspect fell a bit flat for me.

A breath of fresh air (First thing I thought of too even before reading other comments).\n\nIs it just me? But I'm looking forward to a sequel. The moment I saw the crab monster's eyes, I thought that \"wouldn't it be cool if there would be a sequel wherein they try to fight back against the monsters while getting help from the good ones?\"\n\nBut the ending itself is nice and heartwarming. A sequel isn't really necessary but I just wanna see this movie's universe more.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention how moving it was to watch boy. Saw in the credits that there were actually 2 dogs who played boy's role. What a bunch of adorable and intelligent floofs.", "What a charming flick. Dude goes on a journey to find love but ultimately finds himself. Simple yet elegantly done.", "I got everything I wanted out of it- not a forced romance, reunion with boy, his colony saved, and a final glimpse of his travel companions. It wrapped so well. I loved it.", "Watched it last night. Really enjoyed it. I knew exactly what to expect going in and it all boils down to your typical YA post apocalyptic road film. The thing that set it apart is its optimistic tone and heart. Dylan Obrien carries this movie on his shoulders from start to finish with the help of Boy. Some really cool set pieces and moments of action and emotional pull. Two that stand out are the grenade kill against the giant centipede thing? Really dope sequence and the leeches after were nightmarish. Other standout scene was the Mav1s scene. His acting in that is soooo good and the song was totally unexpected and perfect. He pulls off the sad, neurotic, inexperienced kid feel really well. Thought the use of side characters was good too. Glad his old crew wasnt just tossed away and forgotten about. His reunion with them was a great scene. Last 30 minutes felt rushed but I loved the closing monologue and how its setup as a repeating transmission of his book over the radio. Loved the evolution of his character into an experienced wilderness man. Loved the companion tag-along parts with Minnow and Clyde. Really hope we get a sequel or two that expands on the world and characters weve seen.", "Such a fun movie. Enjoyed it immensely. \n\nThis movie if it was made in the 80s, well 10 year old me would have loved it even more.", "It was a good film although the premise has been repeated a lot that it felt parody of \"reclaim nature from aliens\" type of movies. The editing and camera were typical, straightforward textbook. \n\nI liked the acting in this film. The animations and VFX weren't of high budget but didn't feel tacky either, they were to the point. \n\nThe dog character Boy has been used to perfection and kudos to their handlers (yes two dogs were casted to play Boy)\n\nThe way prologue is shot is my favourite. The movie also ends on an expected note, >!him brodcasting his DIY Surface Hacks!<. Overall on the feelings, the film reminded me of How to train your dragons.", "A very fun movie, period.

Obviously plot is a bit cliche but not expecting too much. CGI was solid. Since it's a first movie and there might be sequels, felt the relationships between characters was lacking a bit. Relationship and scenes with main character + dog + Mav1s + 2 survivors were pretty good. But his relationship with his colony and Aimee definitely seemed weak since there just wasn't enough substance to it (whether it be from current time or flashbacks) -- this is a pretty major flaw imo since those are Joel's motivation to get through the journey. \n\nOverall, would definitely watch a sequel, but would want more backstory of the side characters.", "I want a sequel.", "i loved it , the cgi was really good , didnt expect them feels with the robot n doggo , very hoping for a sequel, monster design was aawesome", "Did anyone else notice on Joel's map that it shows the path he took west, and it shows a split path to the right that goes North (Where Clyde and Minnow went) and in red letters it said \"Don't go right!\" I was expecting to not see Minnow or Clyde again.\n\nThis movie was awesome. I almost skipped over it on Prime Video because of the title, but then I decided to try the trailer. It was $20 bucks to rent, or $25 to buy, and boy am I glad I bought it.", "Really great.

One of my favorite movies!", "An enjoyable enough post-apocalyptic on the road film, very similar to Zombieland which I also liked.

Hoping we get a sequel that expands the lore and adds more monsters.\n\n\nSo does this also mean that people were aware of the big bugs for a while *before* going underground?

That aside the film was fantastic. Judge was an asshole as he supposed to be so props to Langella. Refreshing to see Gordon-Levitt again, even though he has little room to wiggle through. \n\nThat aside, delving down the wiki-hole after watching it was one hell of a ride. The Fred Hampton assassination was fucking disgusting, although it looked tame compared to the COINTELPRO shit the FBI did.", "Can we give Frank Langella some props for being probably the best on screen villain since whoever the guy that played Skeletor in Masters Of The Universe is.", "That was the most \"and that student's name? Albert Einstein\"-ass ending I've ever seen.", "The opening was fantastic. Sorkin does such a good job settling you in to a time and place. I immediately knew who everyone was and why they were important.", "Mark Rylance was amazing in this. Should be nominated for Supporting Actor. Sacha Baron Cohen, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Redmayne and Yahya Abdul-Mateen were also great.", "The court transcript is available online and this trial really was a travesty of justice. \n\nI think this movie did a serviceable job in toe-ing the line to portray an infuriating situation without coming off as ham-fisted (i.e. making the prosecution cartoonish-ly evil and the defence cartoonishly good). In my opinion, the events speak for themselves without needing to take artistic license with the characters of anyone involved. \n\nHowever, these moments in particular felt contrived.\n\n1) The final scene of Hayden reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers did not happen as far as I'm aware, and the change from what really happened seemed unnecessary. The actual closing statement made by Kunstler is really powerful, and I'll quote it at the end. \n\n2) The moment where Hoffman talks about pronouns and how he has actually read all of Hayden's publications was sort of a \"wink at the camera\" moment. \n\n3) Ramsey Clark's portrayal was a caricature. Making him a casual give-no-fucks badass was satisfying to watch as a viewer, but definitely was playing to the audience's sympathies. \n\n4) One of the most confusing additions is David Dellinger punching the deputy, which did not happen in real life. Dellinger was a radical pacifist and this addition is offensive. \n\n5) Showing Fred Hampton being murdered during the time of the trial - when he was murdered over a month later. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nGeneral thoughts:\n\nI enjoyed the decision to humanize JGL by showing his internal struggle between his ethics and duty to the law- though I'm not sure as to the veracity of this.\n\nIncredible performances by Judge Hoffman, Seale, Kunstler, Dellinger, Hayden, and Strong in particular. Eddie Redmayne pulled off a great accent, while surprisingly I felt that Sacha Baron Cohen's accent was a little sloppy at times. \n\nSorkin is a master of dialogue, and could have done without some of the snarky whispers that are really directed at the audience. \tMost of Lee Weiner's dialogue consisted of these quips.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAll-in-all, the events that happened are really so absurd that it must have been hard to convey their realism. Things like Hoffman/Rubin wearing the robes, the treatment of Seale, gross bias from the judge, etc. \n\nThe verdict of the trial in reality was not a feel-good moment, and I'm still confused as to why it was portrayed as such. Along with the sentences, the judge ordered the long hair of the defendants AND defense attorneys to be forcibly cut due to being deemed offensive. The real life events left many people angry, and I believe this movie should have left the viewer feeling angry as well - if true to history. \n\n-----------------------------\n\nParts of the closing statement from the (real life) trial:\n\n>  \"When a new truth comes upon the earth, or a great idea necessary for mankind is born, where does it come from?  Not from the police force, or the prosecuting attorneys, or the judges, or the lawyers, or the doctors.  Not there.  It comes from the despised and the outcasts, and it comes perhaps from jails and prisons.  It comes from men who have dared to be rebels and think their thoughts, and their faith has been the faith of rebels.\n    \"What do you suppose would have happened to the working men except for these rebels all the way down through history?  Think of the complacent cowardly people who never raise their voices against the powers that be.  If there had been only these, you gentlemen of the jury would be hewers of wood and drawers of water.  You gentlemen would have been slaves.  You gentlemen owe whatever you have and whatever you hope to these brave rebels who dared to think, and dared to speak, and dared to act.\"\n\n\n> An intolerable war abroad has divided and dismayed us all.  Racism at home and poverty at home are both causes of despair and discouragement.  In a so-called affluent society, we have people starving, and people who can't even begin to approximate the decent life.\n    These are rough problems, terrible problems, and as has been said bv everybody in this country, they are so enormous that they stagger the imagination.  But they don't go away by destroying their critics.  They don't vanish by sending men to jail.  They never did and they never will.\n    To use these problems by attempting to destroy those who protest against them is probably the most indecent thing that we can do.  You can crucify a Jesus, you can poison a Socrates, you can hand John Brown or Nathan Hale, you can kill a Che Guevara, you can jail a Eugene Debs or a Bobby Seale.  You can assassinate John Kennedy or a Martin Luther King, but the problems remain.  The solutions are essentially made by continuing and perpetuating with every breath you have the right of men to think, the right of men to speak boldly and unafraid, the right to be masters of their souls, the right to live free and to die free.  The hangman's rope never solved a single problem except that of one man.", "I suppose the \"one egg is an oeuf\" joke needs to be added to the grand list of Sorkinisms", "Abbie Hoffman was also portrayed in Forrest Gump.  The hippie at the Vietnam protest who gives him the microphone and says \"Viet Fucking Nam!\"", "Really enjoyed the movie. Did a great job of showing, as Hoffman said, the contempt the government had (and still has) for certain groups of people. Mayor\u2019s office denying permits to the park, police armed to the teeth at a peaceful protest because of the lack of permits, the police hounding, cornering, and then starting the violence. Nixon\u2019s White House and the DOJ making an example out of a group of people that the prior DOJ found to be innocent. A racist bigot senile judge who has already determined guilt before the trial began. It\u2019s all so infuriating.", "I know some people aren't happy with the name reading at the end, but I honestly found it touching and teared up some. The protest where about stopping more deaths in a unwinnable war.  I like to think it was also done to really echo whats going on today: too many innocent lives were lost that didn't need to be lost- from covid, to police brutality, and protest. It's too easy to just recognize the amount of deaths and not see them as individuals wiith families.\n\nThe acting was honestly amazing. I honestly forgot this was a Sorkin feature.", "I've never had the beginning of a movie hype me up more than this one. The introduction of Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, Tom Hayden, David Dellinger, and Jerry Rubin finishing each other's sentences, mixed with the archival footage of the mounting tensions over Vietnam and the draft was spectacular. Like we were immediately rolling into the sixties.", "Honestly, I feel like this movie is perfect in its timing. The widespread protests, police violence, judicial appointments, political trials, the chaos behind the concept of \u201claw and order\u201d, etc. \n\nBeing someone who lives in Portland and has attended numerous protests here (only to have the narrative be reconstructed in a misleading way 99% of the time) it felt somewhat justified to have a similar story told on screen.\n\nI also loved the way they portrayed the differences between Bobby Seale and the rest of the group: Bobby was **not** treated like a human being with equal protections under the law during this trial. The scene where they gagged him actually made me feel sick. Obviously he\u2019s not a huge part of the conclusion of the story, but I\u2019m very happy that they gave us plenty of time to absorb what he went through and how he was treated in the initial phases rather than having them treat him like some sort of tangent. \n\nThen the differences between Hayden and Hoffman was great. I loved their dialogue and I feel like it tells a story about what\u2019s currently happening with the left side of the US political spectrum. I\u2019m someone who relates to Hayden a bit more than I relate to Hoffman, but when Hayden stands for the judge, I actually wanted to scream at him. I also loved when Hoffman gave his testimony and blew everyone out of the water. \n\nAnd that judge....I think the last \u201ccharacter\u201d I hated more was Joffrey Baratheon (and Joff was fictional!). \n\nOverall, I can see why this movie might not be super satisfying for normal people who aren\u2019t revolving their entire lives around the current political situation were in, but for myself, I thoroughly enjoyed it.", "Incredible, IMO. \n\nThe acting ranged from passable to great. No bad performances. Frank langella was excellently frustrating as the judge. Cohen and Redmayne were really evocative of their respective counterparts, even if they weren't spot on impressions.\n\nThe writing was excellent, Sorkin-y but not outlandish. Witty but not to the point of not being believable. Often Sorkin's characters dont seem real becuase of how quick witted they all are. I felt he pulled back enough here though.\nI believe I remember that egg joke from an episode of the westwing from Margaret to Leo, too.\n\nDirecting was pretty good too. The story moved along well. And the framing of the story around the trial was very well done.\n\nFor cons.. I do find it dipped in intensity a little bit once Bobby Seales mistrial was called, that really felt like a bigger \"win\" than the ending. And the ending wasnt great, but to be fair the ending in real life wasnt great either. I honestly cant think of a way for the real life ending to be portrayed optimistically, maybe it shouldnt have been. But I respect Sorkin for trying, there are enough pessimists.\n\nSolid 9 / 10", "Clap at the end felt like such a 90s scene. \n\nStill enjoyed the movie although I didn't know that much about that story.", "Loved this. Gripping story, legitimately funny, and genuinely moving. This movie felt like Sorkin really finding a way to blend so much of what makes his work so special-- snappy dialogue, quippy humor, courtroom drama, and serious, heavy-handed political themes. \n\nI went in with high expectations and Sorkin really exceeded them. As an aside-- at the end of the movie, when they gave us the coda about how the defendants lives progressed, I realized just how old-fashioned  this type of movie has become. Shout out to Netflix and Paramount for having the hudspa to put out a movie like this.", "I was impressed by the performances (Jeremy Strong was particularly entertaining) and liked the ultimately anti-war messages even if the final scene was a little outlandish. Anyone else notice a few weird cuts, particularly towards the beginning of the trial when the judge shuts down Abbie?", "Such a good film.\n\nFrank Langella, SBC, Mark Rylance and Eddie Redmayne deserve to be up for awards consideration.\n\nReally liked how Sorkin spliced real riot footage in between filmed riot footage. Made you fee like you were actually there.\n\nThe shots at Trump were kinda noticeable as well \"The President is not the client of the Attorney General.\"\n\nDefinitely something to watch in history class to educate our kids.", "I\u2019m amazed by it! Is it mostly factual? There was really a bound and gagged defendant?", "I can't remember the last movie I saw with such an excellent ensemble cast. Nearly every performance in this movie is worthy of an Oscar nomination. Combined with Sorkin's writing and directing, it is my favorite movie of the year so far, and will likely remain so.", "I loved the 'do you think there were only 7 people protesting and the rest were all FBI informants?' line. I've often wondered that myself pertaining to certain groups.", "Best line: \n\n\"Alright, raise your hands if any of you have ever shown up for jury duty. No? Then shut the fuck up.\"", "I really loved the movie.\n\nJeremy Strong Sach Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance were the standouts (either Rylance or SBC or both should get a nom). Redmayne was very good. Nobody disappointed.  Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale was a scene stealer, particularly in one scene (you know the one).\n\nI particularly liked the contrast between Cohen and Redmayne's characters, and how they represented change in different ways.\n\nThe editing and the cinematography was also really great. It can make a scene carry weight.\n\nThe movie also seemed very relevant to today's society, and I'm sure that's no coincidence.\n\nMy only problem with it was the ending with everyone standing up and the inspirational music while the Judge suddenly is helpless to stop it. Felt very \"Robert Zumeckis\". But that's a neatpick. \n\nEdit: Also, Michael Keaton entire scene and testimony were so satisfying. And Ramsey Clark is STILL ALIVE!", "Mark Rylance fucking killed it. Going into this film, with all the talent involved, he was kind of the last person I was looking at out of that cast. His performance told me \u201cfuck you\u201d and ended up and ended up overshadowing everyone else. You know you\u2019re a great actor when you end up more noticeable than Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman with a giant afro. Bravo, Mark Rylance. You always surprise me.", "A lot of great performances in here. Very impressed with Sacha Baron Coen especially in the scene where he takes the stand. Mark Rylance was killing it the whole movie too. Eddie Redmayne gave a very quiet nuanced performance and spoke a lot with his body language. Yahya Abdul Mateen is really a scene stealer his scene in the jail is incredibly poignant. Jeremy Strong was pretty hilarious throughout. I loved Michael Keaton\u2019s brief appearance as well. \n\nGreat use of editing in this movie during the trial scenes loved the way it cut between flashbacks and people on the stand, different characters finishing sentences. \n\nThe portrayal of the rivalry between Hoffman and Hayden was a great narrative thread that was pretty relevant to today. They both had good points and it was nice to see them sort of embracing each other in the final moments. Hoffman becomes more composed on the stand and Hayden creates a flashy display on the trials final day. \n\nThe police scenes were hard to watch at times and man that judge is a piece of human garbage.", "Superb. Not Sorkin's best, but the snappy, infectious energy of his dialogue bled into the directing choices as well, and not a moment felt wasted. Unexpectedly hilarious, too.\n\nAlso, I'm so happy to see my man Jeremy Strong finally getting the spotlight he deserves.

He regularly made harsh calls to arms and was described as a militant anti-war advocate. He embraced the antics of the defendants and even sported a bucket hat and fake goatee, and went to sleep on the table during the trial. \n\nDellinger was by far the oldest but not a shrinking violet. HE read the names (of American AND  Viet-Cong soldiers) portrayed at the end of the movie, during which Hoffman and Hayden laid out an American AND Viet-Cong flag. The bailiffs then fought Hoffman for the Vietnamese flag but left the American one, pushing Hoffman to announce the court is okay with the defendants disrespecting America but not Vietnam. Dellinger also called Schultz and the judge racists and Nazis and was cited for contempt for that. \n\nBobby Seale was tied up for 3 consecutive days before he was released and allowed a new trial. The bailiffs also punched him in the testicles during the trial at one point when his bonds slipped. \n\nJerry Rubin was certainly a stoner and played the dumb hippie well.

He also didn\u2019t fall for the \u201choney pot.\u201d The informant tied to him was an undercover male cop that largely tailed him and definitely didn\u2019t use the same line on him as Margaret did in \u201cThe West Wing.\u201d\n\nThe trial as a whole was a clown show at best.

One theme it touches is how power and control can be above justice and truth, very relevant for today's discourse. A great work of art.", "Jeremy Strong and SBC really shone in this film imo. The whole cast was great but their performances went above and beyond imo", "Having thought on this a bit, I thought overall it was an excellent film. As I wrote elsewhere in the thread there was obviously a lot of back and forth that could not have made it in due to time. The two issues I had are quite simple:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDellinger should **not** have punched anyone. It would be like having a film of version MLK Jr or Gandhi punch someone - it simply was inaccurate and needless.\n\nSecondly, I wish there was more of the defence witnesses shown. Defence witnesses were *incredible*: Alan Ginsburg, Judy Collins, Timothy Leary, Arlo Guthrie, etc. It was the who's who of the liberal left movement on the stand. Hell, Judy Collins *sang* [Where Have All the Flowers Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxsNKD6el5s) *into the record.*", "I think the sharpest commentary in this film was by-far the conflict of ideology between Hoffman and Holden as placeholders for radical Idealism and Pragmatism.\n\nKnowing Sorkin's politics going into the film, I knew the essential points that were going be made. I was NOT however, expecting an internal dialogue about frictions and in-fighting on the left (VERY relevant nowadays). What\u2019s more important; playing the part until you can ascend the hierarchy enough to dismantle the system, or seeing the bigger picture and shaping hearts and minds to change the psychological landscape? The film did a great job of highlighting these different ideologies accurately, as well as making it clear that whilst one attitude is more sensible and agreeable, the other is a lot sexier and more immediately appealing. Ultimately though, these two voices have to come to an understanding and unite in the face of their common enemy (taking the form of the \u2018thug\u2019 judge). It takes a healthy mix of both idealistic and pragmatic thinking to make change.\n\nThis struck me as the most interesting and poignant theme in this film, and perhaps Sorkin\u2019s main angle since he knew people on the right probably weren\u2019t going to give the film a chance:\nThat everyone on the left needs to put aside their moral-elitism or smug-centrism and come together as a united front. Because people on the right have a fuck of a lot less in-fighting.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nA smug centrist.", "I just finished the movie and damn it may be one of the best movies I\u2019ve ever seen it even made me put my phone away and watch the movie 10/10 would try again", "What a great film.

The two primary sequences of police brutality (Jerry and Rennie on the Hill and Tom's Tape) are both underscored with some absolutely electrifying pieces of music. \n\n\nPemberton has made some very diverse scores over the years, but the way the score begins in universe with the drums from the protest, only to have them continue and build when the scene ends in stellar. You can literally hear the moment that the protest has gotten away from our main characters' control as the score becomes too fast for the chanting, too chaotic and frenetic in the moments before 'Take the hill!'.\n\n\nTruly an outstanding couple of songs there. \n\n\nWhich makes the horrible over the top music at the end that much more baffling.", "Can someone please explain to me why the fraternity guys were so pissed about the girl with the flag?", "\u201cThe president isn\u2019t the client of the attorney general\u201d Someone should tell that to the Donald.", "Loved this movie.

Sometimes courtroom dramas like this can drag, but I think the whole thing was paced very well; I was gripped the whole time.\n\nWanted to give a shoutout to the Jack and the Beanstalk joke/conversation, actually made me laugh out loud in the middle of a somewhat tense scene haha.", "The script kind of felt all over the place at times, but overall was a pretty good film depicting how the government acted against protestors. Funny coincidence that it came out this year. I figured the scene where Bobby Seale is bound in court was dramatized for effect, but sounds like the reality was even worse than what Sorkin put in the film. So after reading the real history of the case, I think Sorkin did a very good job of showing how nuts this trial was while making sure it, for the most part, did not seem as literally unbelievable as the reality was.\n\nEdit: It sounds like he didn't do as great a job with the characters themselves, which seems kind of strange. I feel like if he needed more drama there was more than enough real-life shit to draw on. But ah well. Abdul-Mateen deserves a ton of praise for his acting in this film and I'm glad to see him getting a lot of substantial roles lately.", "This mirrors what's happening right now to a crazy degree. When was this filmed?!", "Absolutely loved this. Everyone was superb. Hated Frank Langella, so he must have been excellent. Not a single duff note.", "This movie was fine. I enjoy Sorkin as a writer just like most everyone, but this didn\u2019t really have the sharp precision like Social Network or Steve Jobs. He\u2019s good at emotional swells but he leaned on that a little too much for me and it made for some sentimental moments that I didn\u2019t really connect with. I\u2019ve seen this and Molly\u2019s game and I have to say I\u2019m not really a fan of his touch as a director. I\u2019m not a filmmaker so I won\u2019t pretend to know specifics but there\u2019s something about his music choice and the way he shoots things that seems kind of bland. Die hard Sorkin heads will worship this movie and rightfully so, but I think a different directors approach would\u2019ve taken a story like this to the heights it could reach.", "I finally managed to watch this.\n\nJust give Sorkin all the movies.  Any movie.\n\nGuy is a goddamn genius with dialogue.", "I\u2019m conflicted about this movie.\n\nOn the one hand, I really dislike how Sorkin portrays leftist politics. The tension between pragmatism and idealism is a gross oversimplification of the arguments on the left. When Abbie says that we have a revolution \u201cevery four years\u201d I think I visibly winced. That felt, to me, at least, like Sorkin making leftists out to be liberals. The fact that many of these people were socialists seems to be unspoken on purpose, but at least the Black Panthers are depicted somewhat fairly. I think Sorkin\u2019s liberal centrism shines through here even more than it does in The West Wing, where he\u2019s replaced the actual closing statement with a feel-good ending. The ending was not feel-good in real life, and I think putting a liberal \u201cgood guys always win by taking the moral high ground\u201d spin on what is really a tough leftist struggle, a disservice is done to all people involved. Same with having Dellinger, a radical pacifist, punch the cops in the courtroom.\n\nOn the other hand, hoooooly shit is this some good-ass Sorkin. I\u2019m a fanboy and idgaf. Superb writing, direction, performances. Spectacular movie.\n\nIn short, I\u2019m a radical leftist who gives Sorkin a pass because holy fucking shit is he good lmao", "Every single actor did their job amazingly in this film!", "this movie was very very good...as expected of a film written by the one and only Aaron Sorkin....", "Jeremy Strong absolutely killed his role - between this and succession he\u2019s quickly becoming one of my favorites. All around I loved the movie but I haven\u2019t checked all the historical accuracies yet", "Did anyone hear \u201cThe Daily\u201d podcast from The NY Times from this past Monday 11/16 about \u201cDivision Among the Democrats\u201d?  The argument between Hoffman and Hayden had a lot of similarities between some divisions still between the Left and Moderate wings of the Party.   I was really struck by the idea of winning elections to allow for policy to occur vs policy first because otherwise why win elections. It\u2019s a open question with strong points made on both sides in the podcast.", "It's crazy how many parallels the events of this movie have to today. Just unbelievable", "Cool movie. Performances were good all around. IRL he didn't actually read those names in court tho, right? I mean they would have obviously beat his ass and dragged him away by the 9th name.", "This film was fantastic. Not gonna lie, when Jeremy Strong first came on the screen I burst into laughter and feared I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it seriously. But I ended up being thoroughly impressed with the overall performances. Mark Rylance, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Eddie Redmayne in particular were absolutely wonderful.", "The film was entertaining.\n\nHOWEVER the film pretty inaccurate. Idk much about the actual trial to be honest but I do know a lot about the Black Panthers and Fred Hampton's murder does not match the time line at all. Sorkin just threw that in there. Also Bobby Seale was bound and gagged for THREE DAYS straight not 10 minutes like the film made it seem.\n\nThe \"cop murder\" the movie mentions Seale was arrested for was actually a Black Panther member/suspected FBI informant.\n\nI also think they tried too hard to make the prosecution look sympathetic to the 7. \n\nIt was a good film though.", "what accent was Sascha trying to portray?\n\nMark Rylance can do no wrong.  Jeremy Strong was also unrecognizable.", "Reading some of the criticism I just wanted to say that I think it\u2019s 100% acceptable to take artistic license with historical events to convey an overall sentiment. If you want total historic accuracy read a book or watch a documentary, that\u2019s not the point of narrative filmmaking.", "Eddie Redmayne was great. The music in this movie added so much energy, I loved it.", "Excellent, particularly Keaton, Rylance, Yahya, and John Carroll Lynch.", "I found the ending to be a little too cheesy. If they had gotten rid of the swelling music and the shot of the son being proud of his dad or whatever and just let the gravity of the names hit it would\u2019ve been perfect. Besides that though great movie", "Great movie but I almost regret watching it, just to soul crushing. Makes me so angry and sad that there is so little justice in the world. Honestly crying, I just fucking hate everything about this being real.", "Just finished watching.  Wow. I hated the judge so much I even hate Frank Langella now.  \nReally great movie. Scary how much history is repeating itself.", "I loved Molly's Game and I think The Trial of the Chicago 7 is even better. Sorkin starting his movie directing career 2 for 2", "It's incredible that Sorkin wrote the script for this nearly a decade ago. It feels so tailored to the present moment.", "[deleted]", "Everyone's already said what I wanted to say but I still wish to publicly declare my love for this movie because I enjoyed it so much: I love this movie! It might genuinely be my favourite of the year.\n\nSorkin's really refining his craft, especially as a director. He's always been a good writer but from a directing standpoint this is a huge step up from Molly's Game.", "Maybe I've been a little more starved for good new movies than normal, but I fucking adored this movie. Those who don't like Sorkin, this will likely not convert you to his writing, but his directing is a step up from his first effort, and the editing alongside the other tech elements are especially sharp and easily watchable.\n\nThe main draw here is the acting and the dialogue (who doesn't love to watch witty people argue, honestly?). While a lot of people have shouted the praises of the cast, Mark Rylance was the standout for me, just being so damn watchable and easy to root for. He stands a good chance at an Oscar nod. However, he'll be duking it out with Yahya Abdul Mateen who embodies everything frustrating about this trial and how it treated Bobby Seale in so many damn good ways, and Sacha Baron Cohen who starts out a bit one note, but really makes Abbie Hoffman truly interesting, deep, and compelling. While he probably won't get awards love, Frank Langella is also so fucking good at portraying how incompetent and scary Judge Hoffman was.\n\nI'd also like to give a shoutout to the rest of the cast who probs won't get nominations; not a single one is giving a bad performance. Michael Keaton is stealing the show in two very noteworthy scenes. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is showing up to remind us how much we've missed him recently and brings a little bit more to what could be a one-note character. JOHN FUCKING CAROLL LYNCH, the Zodiac Killer himself, is there being amazing and I really wanted to say his name, alongside Jeremy Strong who had me laughing way too damn much. Finally, I've had issues with him previously, and was originally worried about him in the first third, but Eddie Redmayne playing someone so different from his usual wheelhouse was a sight to see, especially his performance in the last third.\n\nWatch this movie, and if you're voting a certain way coming up, really look for the similarities. While some of this movie was made with those modern similarities in mind, the events of this summer could not have been predicted to be so close to what unfolds in parts of this movie. Watch it, and really think about who you're voting for.", "Enjoyed the movie but man that last scene is 90\u2019s prestige cheeseball ending. It stops just short of one person starting a slow clap.", "Keaton scene was my favorite. Dick on table fuck you pay me style", "Is this still a good movie to watch if I have zero interest in US politics?\n\nEDIT: so I've watched it and for anyone else wondering the same thing, yes it's a still a good movie even if you don't care about US politics", "Mark my words, this movie will easily win Best Picture in next year's Oscars. It was riveting and perfectly timed politically.", "Holy shit dude, was the Judge really that bad in real life?", "Between Skeletor, Nixon and this fucking Judge, I think a part of me just irrationally hates Frank Langella", "What a movie! Honestly, the performances were pretty much great across the board. Plenty of humor sprinkled in, but not enough to take away from the serious subject matter. \n\nA friend has said that he measures a movie by how quickly it flies by. Thought this one FLEW, and I mean that in the best way possible.", "Im sorry but how the fuk did a guy like Julius fucking Cuntman become a judge? And how the fuk was he not punished?", "This movie was something.....I loved every minute of it, I was glued to the screen, incredible script and performances.", "I thought the film was absolutely fantastic. The performances were all great, particular from Redmayne and Baron-Cohen. The editing was really good and the script was brilliant. It was also surprisingly funny which I was not expecting but enjoyed. Overall, a absolutely great film and perhaps my favourite by the end of the year", "Very topical and very effective. I found myself truly emotionally invested despite recognizing some clich\u00e9s and some heavyhanded moments. For instance, at the end when >!Eddie Redmayne started reading the list of dead Vietnam soldiers, and the music swelled, and the whole courtroom stood up and clapped!< I was rolling my eyes but also simultaneously had tears welling up in that very same pair of eyes. I will say, however, those moments were very few and far between and I did genuinely like this movie a lot. I love it when comedic actors go dramatic, so Sacha Baron Cohen was a standout for me, but I feel like Frank Langella is going really unappreciated as the Judge. He did a fantastic job of being such a believable, unlikable, unqualified asshole. He really disappeared into the part, he's a great actor. \n\nAnother - not so much a critique, I guess more of a comment - I had was it wasn't as \"zing-y\" as Sorkin's previous scripts. For me, that was a bit of a letdown because I love zing-y Sorkin (Steve Jobs is a personal favorite). But I also know a lot of people criticize him for that same zing-y-ness, so this could be seen as a positive for this film.\n\nRegardless, I really enjoyed it, and I think how emotionally affected I ended up is a testament to the film's quality. I think every American interested in the coming election (which should be all of us) should give this a watch", "Great movie. Each one of the actors in it did a phenomenal job.", "I gotta say, that was one of the best movie intro's I've ever seen!", "I just watched this movie and I just wanna say that that judge is a complete bastard.", "I'm a sucker for Sorkin.  Film definitely reached that itch.  It's disappointing to read some of the liberties he took, especially with the closing scene.\n\n\nPerformances made the movie for me.  Rylance, Cohen, Strong, and Langella were all fantastic.  JGL and Redmayne seemed to mail in their standard good-to-great performances, but nothing spectacular.  Michael Keaton holds such a presence nowadays, his revival is the best.", "So much hate going towards SBC in this movie makes no sense. He fucking killed it. Dude is a stud", "This is pretty conclusive evidence that Sorkin shouldn't be directing. The difference between David Fincher or Danny Boyle is stark. It was really clear that he could have used an expert hand, especially to help him resolve some of the more glaring problems (fade to black during the Hoffman testimony, abrupt and corny ending). Honestly I think he benefits from having to share decision-making power.\n\nOverall this was pretty good, and a great performance from SBC. I don't mind editorial choices made to tell a good story (like Steve Jobs) but a lot of the choices made here force Sorkin's own weak politics into the story where they don't belong. \n\nIt was heartbreaking the way Rubin was portrayed as a burnout and the Panthers were represented as libs (though Abdul-Mateen was great) who thought the idea of Seale saying \"fry the pigs\" was out of line. Also the fictional well-meaning undercover FBI agent who was only trying to help the protests continue peacefully, or how Richard Schultz was *reluctantly* going along with the prosecution but was secretly a \"good guy.\"\n\nAbbie Hoffman was portrayed mostly pretty well, but it was pretty frustrating to hear him on the stand say that he thought the US had great institutions and the only problem is the wrong people in charge. Like he was an anarcho-communist, he didn't just want a more polite democrat president he really wanted to change the country fundamentally. But since that perspective isn't something Sorkin's brain can really handle because he has bad politics Hoffman has to be made into a dissenting liberal. \n\nAll these changes reinforce Sorkin's politics, which are basically that the status quo is fine, the FBI is good actually, there may be some bad eggs in the justice system from time too time but thank God that Our Great American Institutions will correct their errors, the Vietnam war was a crime *because of the draft* not because it killed millions in South East Asia.\n\nThrough these choices the actual voices of the defendants are ironed over, flattened into mild critique. That's a bummer, you know?\n\nEdit: [Chapo released a podcast today with the guys from The West Wing Thing]( https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackWolfFeed/comments/jgoy0i/465_sorkinverse_rise_of_the_7_feat_dave_anthony/) on the film that expresses a similar opinion to mine, but with a much more detailed understanding of the individuals and historical events. If you are interested in a thorough examination of how Sorkin misrepresented the characters they do a better and funnier job than I did. Turns out be misrepresent the truth in a much more significant way than I understood.", "I really enjoyed this film overall. It's nice to see another Sorkin film centered around a trial, as it reminded me of \"A Few Good Men\" at times. \n\nI also found the argument between Hayden and Abbie Hoffman to be a pretty powerful illustration of the differences within the progressive movement that still exist today. I think my biggest criticism would be that ended on a note that was a smidge too feel-good in my opinion, even by Sorkin standards-- but I think it was at least a nice antidote to how goddamn infuriating I found the judge to be. Seriously, Frank Langella's character is up there with Nurse Ratched and Dolores Umbridge in the pantheon of characters that just get under your skin.", "Wow. So many emotions... from sadness to complete fury. One of my takeaways is that judges have way too much power. I didn\u2019t know much about The Chicago 7 going into this movie, but I do want to read up on it, if anyone has any book suggestions.", "I like the ending even if it's kinda cheesy", "Fantastic movie. I think Sorkin needs to be given more credit as a director. Simply hiring great actors doesn\u2019t automatically mean amazing performances, but it\u2019s clear with this and Molly\u2019s Game he knows how to make great movies. Excited for anything he directs in the future now too, though I hope he continues getting movies made outside of his own directorial projects too.", "There were parts that were done phenomenally and fewer moments that stood out to me as kinda poorly done in comparison especially the ending which left a really sour taste in my mouth. For a movie so angry and sparky the ending felt completely out of touch with the rest of the film.\n\nThe movie has an excellent sense of pacing however, and from the first scene you are immediately drawn into the plot. I was not expecting Mark Rylance to show up and put on the best performance of the movie. His frustration was palpable. \n\nSome of the decisions to change facts im history however were pretty gross and unforgivable. I recognize sometimes movies should alter facts to tell an entertaining movie, but those changes should be made only if it serves to benefit the movie, which the historical deviations featured in the film didn't always do.\n\nStill, well worth a watch and the film had moments that were some of my favorite in a movie for 2020.\n\n7.5/10\n\nWould have had a 9 if the film was more reflective of history and ended on a less jubilant, more bittersweet and somber note.", "*The Trial of the Chicago 7* manages to overcome the tv-movie hokiness most biopics-of-the-now fall into (a \"biopic-of-the-now\" is a movie about a historical event that's really about today's politics). I was worried in the first several minutes because of Sorkin's soundtrack choice, which is less fitting in a film about police brutality, the criminal justice system, and free speech than it is in *Hairspray*, but Sorkin, as he usually does when he's on his A-game, is charming enough to overcome that, using quick edits to emphasize just how cut-together these disparate organizers are.\n\nKyle Smith panned this movie by writing Sorkin's highest aim is to \"write quips.\" I disagree with him, and it's largely because of the movie's final image. People here are pointing out the trial never ended with Hayden reading a list of the fallen, that it would have been more powerful for Sorkin to use Kunstler's closing statements. I disagree. Martin Luther King, Jr. was never as disagreeable with LBJ as *Selma* depicted him to be, yet that movie is praised by almost everyone on this subreddit, even for all its tv-movie hokiness (the action in Bloody Sunday sequence is horrifying, but it's undermined by the after-school special narration from the *Times* reporter covering the events).\n\nI will gladly accept Sorkin's artistic license so long as he can compose a final image that is like a Trumbull painting in scope and meaning. It is perhaps his most realized statement of what America can be\u2014even when it fails\u2014than his entire run on *The West Wing.* If a picture's worth a thousand words, how many words am I saying this last image has? The black and white men and women standing as Hayden reads the names of the fallen, as Judge Hoffman bangs his gavel for order with as much fury as he can, is an America that takes a stand for justice when its institutions fail them while respecting and upholding its ideals all the same. A beautiful and stirring statement for a vivid and by turns horrifying movie.", "Some say Hayden is still reading names to this day", "Did anyone else notice what Bill said to Bobby when he was gagged?\n\n*Can he breath? Can you breath all right, Bobby?*", "If it wasn't for Covid this would probably have been a surprise box office hit of 2020, God knows Paramount would've needed it", "I really enjoyed this, its pretty easily my favorite movie of the year to this point. I'm a big Sorkin fan, and this cast is stacked with actors I like, so it was always a good bet that I would like this one, and I think its a step up from Molly's Game (which I also really liked). For the record, I was pretty unaware of this story (I'm American, but our schools do a pretty bad job of teaching recent American History) and didn't really know anything going in.\n\nWhat I liked: I can't talk about a Sorkin movie without mentioning his writing. I especially loved the opening scene as it cut between the different groups. The performances are pretty much great across the board, with only one that I didn't like. Frank Langella would be my MVP, he was so hate-able and from what I understand the character was actually turned down. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Mark Rylance were also standouts. In particular I've never really seen SBC in a serious role, and now I really wish we'd gotten his Freddy Mercury movie. I really liked the way the movie was structured, with the flashbacks and real footage integrated into the movie.\n\nWhat I didn't like: I didn't much buy Jeremy Strong's performance. I don't know much about Jerry Rubin, so maybe that's just how he actually comes across, but in this film it felt more like an actor in a costume than a real person. I wish a few of the actors had gotten more to do, especially John Carroll Lynch and JGL. And while I admit it got me pretty emotional at the time, I think the ending being a work of fiction takes something away from its power.\n\nOverall this is a 9/10 for me. I think Sorkin hit a home run and I hope the attention on this keeps up through awards season.", "honestly, fuck that judge lol. i need to research what actually happened, but if even half of this movie is true, idk how that shit was allowed. Dude really did treat the court like he was in a latin american dictatorship country. \n\nfar as the movie goes, if you like the Sorkin vibes, its great. Great acting all around, the dialogue is exactly what you expect- quippy, funny, not at all how real humans talk but its entertaining as shit. The editing work was actually really good and helped tell the story well (the part with Redmayne recounting a protest event was probably the highlight)", "Damn, that was a fucking great film.", "One of my favorites of the year. Might be the best screenplay of Sorkin's career.", "If Mark Ryalnce hadn't won an oscar for Bridges of Spies, I would say he's the clear favourite to win one for this movie.", "Can anyone explain the political opinion differences between Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden?", "Was anyone else mystified by Abbie Hoffman\u2019s accent? Was that how he really sounded? I looked him up and the real person was from Worcester ma, so maybe it was supposed to be a Boston accent, but if so it was a really bad one. Sacha Baron Cohen is usually incredible at accents, impressions, etc so this surprised me. Otherwise he was great.", "This was a pretty amazing movie, one of the top movies of the year so far. The dialogue was excellent and very well-written, the actors performances were all Oscar worthy, and the story was great. It\u2019s definitely one of the better movies I\u2019ve seen in a while, and for you people complaining about Hollywood unoriginality, this is a nice break away from reboots/sequels/remakes/franchise movies.

Any more that are similar in tone?", "I really enjoyed the film, wasn't a massive fan of the ending. But there were many memorable scenes in it for me. A lot of great performances from the cast really do the story justice. \n\nA very hard watch, but one I was happy I got through.", "I am curious, was the judge's treatment of Bobby Seale over the top for Hollywood or was it this bad in reality.   \n\n\nI know the bound and gagged thing happened, but aside from that was he this vocal about not having representation and the judge ignores it the whole time?  I feel that if I was on a jury and an individual continuously was treated like shit I would be more likely to find them not guilty cause it is clearly not fair.", "Anyone else get a Dead Poets vibe at the end?", "I'm confused by the comments. I just watched the film and I loved it because of the storytelling style and the way it played with music and editing and the acting, but I don't know much about the director and I don't know much about cinema either, although I love it with passion. So, is this a good movie or not? Is it a good adaptation of history or not? \n\nI would love some insight on this, I'm really interested in your opinion!", "The song over the end credits is a fucking banger holy shit", "Loved it. Stellar cast. \n\nI think it would've made a great series at Netflix. I wanted to see more of them.\n\nOne thing I didn't understand, why Sorkin made the prosecutor so sympathetic to the audience?", "Sorkin continues his style and presents to us a wonderful movie. The direction and camera movement reminded me of David Fincher's style. I believe that Aaron Sorkin has picked up a few tricks from David Fincher, and I am looking forward to what he does next. The movie just like The Social Network is wonderfully woven across different time frames to present a coherent understanding of the events.  \n\nFun Fact: Steven Spielberg asked Aaron Sorkin to write a movie about the Chicago 7 many many years ago, but he never got around to it. It was during these times, with Trump and all, that he felt that this movie was needed. \n\nOverall this is a 10/10 for me. I think Sorkin hit a home run. The music score, direction, acting of the movie is on point.", "It was really entertaining seeing the tension between Redmayne and Keaton knowing their battle for the Best Actor Oscar in 2015.", "All star movie. Yahya coming up strong. Also the upcoming Fred Hampton movie should be interesting. I keep thinking about how young he was.21 years old like wow. The Panthers were interesting people from brief reading up on them.Often flawed but interesting.\n\nJesus at the pronoun bit. Loved that. Also loved Hayden's speech. I imagine its seen as a bit sappy and Sorkin to the max and I know aspects of the story have been exaggerated(but also not exaggerated enough  too) but I did like it and the ending.\nDaniel Pemberton's score was superb too\n\nAlso yea highly relevant in the time of the Floyd protests. That bit with the cops taking of badges was terrifying to me tbh. Didn't cops cover up badges this year too?", "Was a great movie until the cliche \u201cand everybody clapped\u201d ending that was so loud you couldn\u2019t even hear Redmaynes character read the list of names.", "Maybe because I\u2019ve known about this case fully for so long in my life but the way Sorkin tried to \u201cSocial Network\u201d this story was just...I\u2019ll say it...lazy. He tried to Sorkin-y this as much as possible and imo it just didn\u2019t work. Look, I understand every biographical film does need a little bit of fluff for the drama but 80% of the film is fabricated behind typical bullshit Hollywood film exaggerations. The script is all over the place going back and fourth between the trial and flashbacks of the riots attempting to evoke emotion of a lot of stuff that was either muddled or didn\u2019t even happen at all. I honestly think it would have been just fine doing a realistic linear storyline going from the riots to the trial and it would have tugged on the heartstring even more. For instance, BOBBY SEALE WAS TIED UP AND GAGGED FOR SEVERAL DAYS, NOT 5 MINUTES.\n\nAs much problems I have with the screenplay and style of the film, the bright spot was this amazing ensemble cast. Not one weak link at all. Even Jeremy Strong playing as a stoner yippie was hilariously great. Redmayne and Sacha was stellar but the anchor was Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale. He was spectacular and stole every scene (I may be bias because he is becoming one of my favorite up and coming actors). Great performances all around though.\n\nWith all that being said, I don\u2019t \u201chate\u201d it. This film had a lot of potential and maybe if Sorkin didn\u2019t direct this one or had someone co-write with him, it could have been amazing for me.

That said, I didn't hate this movie.\n\nI dunno, it did hit some nostalgic pings for me. Having a love interest with the initials VV, Schneider and Buscemi, a new funny Sandler voice, some familiar audio clips. But it's still all wrapped around this mildly offensive and low effort story. I wrote a comment the other day in a thread about Shooter McGavin about how Sandler used to be so, so good. Like it's no secret but when I think about the simple power scripts like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison had, or even Waterboy, Wedding Singer, Big Daddy. These are movies about actual likeable underdogs and the villains aren't murderers or terrorists they're just huge dicks. You can't help but dislike them, therefore you can't help but root for Sandler. It's really good writing.\n\nSo you take those things and put them on a movie with really none of that nuance and it just misses the mark. Sure, Hubie is a nice guy, but would foxy mom in a waitress outfit Julie Bowen really hold a candle for him for 30 years? Sure, the bullies in this movie are dicks, but every character is basically characterized by whether or not they're a complete dick. There's no subtlety or unique traits, there's just huge dicks and nice people. It just doesn't work as well. I mean the villain didn't even end up being one of the bullies it was his mom and then it became an after school special about bullying which is fine but also not very satisfying.\n\nLike I said, though, I didn't hate it. It was fun enough. I think my main complaint with Happy Madison films in the last several years (I actually haven't seen a lot of the theater releases but am trying to keep up on the Netflix ones now that I don't have to pay or set time aside for them) is how crude they are. I have no issue with dirty humor but filth also needs wit and tact to work and The Wrong Missy, a recent one I saw, just lacked them completely. It was just dirty for the sake of being dirty, no different than a cheap fart joke. Hubie Halloween can almost be considered a family film. There was still a little bit of weird sexual stuff but it wasn't nearly as bad as other movies and honestly without that stuff I was much more able to just sit and watch Sandler be dumb for a couple hours.\n\n5/10. It's totally fine and I've got worse stuff to do then pretend Julie Bowen could fall for someone stupider than me, plus I love the old halloween movie trope where an entire town is in elaborate pop culture costumes.

What worked for me is that Adam Sandler is the hero but he's also primarily the butt of the joke which I felt like he wasn't really doing anymore. I didn't mind his silly voice (which I think is a make or break for many people with the movie) and I thought the supporting cast was a bit more game for everything going on\n\nThere were running gags that had me laughing like Hubie's magical thermos, the violent things thrown at Hubie, and Hubie's moms shirts. Other stuff fell real flat like Shaq's wife's voice and Steve Buscemi/Rob Schneider by the end.\n\nIf you still have a nostalgic spot for Sandler, I would sort of recommend this.

It\u2019s in a damn hurry to get to the next sight gag, dumb ADR\u2019d line, or punchline and things don\u2019t have breathing room to register. Even something as simple as Hubie biking from one scene to another seems to automatically hit you with things zipping past his head this way and that. The fact that it kept recurring was funny eventually, but I felt like an older movie like Happy or Billy would\u2019ve let the previous scene\u2019s punchline land and simply transition to the next major scene without feeling like it has to fill \u201cdead air\u201d with a barrage of sound effects and farts and improv. \n\nIt\u2019s like whoever is making the creative decisions for Happy Madison thinks viewers need to be hit with something every second or they\u2019ll lose interest; almost like the comedy version of BAYHEM, where none of that shit has room to breathe and it\u2019s just an assault on the senses.\n\nedited to add: like him barfing on the bike. WHY? The movie doesn\u2019t even slow down to let that be a joke. It never pays off with a reaction or even an acknowledgment from Hubie.

The part where Tim Meadows is in that costume laughing with those fake hands bouncing around made me cry laugh. Maybe I am easily amused but it\u2019s been so long since I laughed like that.

Wanted a bit more, especially regarding the ending. Still really fun.\n\nIts been a pretty good year for rom coms overall", "Enjoyed this film quite a bit but I felt like it got a little unfocused towards the end. I mean, there's really no easier way to get me on bored than have Weyes Blood do the intro credits song over a montage of hipsters dancing and have the guy from High Maintenance in the movie. But in the end I just wasn't sure what I was meant to get out of it.\n\nI did enjoy the depiction of a modern young hipster couple. Struggling with being socially aware and their own base wants. Trying to be better people but not sure how to do that and not even sure what they have to offer the real world. These two were holding the movie up and their wholesome but real relationship was very interesting to watch, and the invasion that serves as the background was fun as a background gag, but when it comes to the forefront it seemed to spiral a bit.\n\nI think all of these end of the world comedies have a breaking point where the end of the world aspect takes over the comedy aspect. Unless you're going for full on slapstick it's hard to mix the two. Shaun of the Dead is obviously a shining example of this that blends the comedy and the horrible reality of it nicely and when it wants to pack a punch it does. This movie, however, I felt like once they became aware of the invasion the movie lost a lot of its charm and I wasn't even really sure what it wanted me to get out of it.\n\nPerhaps I need to see it again, and I'm not opposed to it, but the last third of this movie kept me scratching my head. Is the point that either end of the technology spectrum is bad and that the sweet spot is somewhere in moderation? Were they ultimately rewarded for stopping for the baby or was it about the general unpredictability of it all? Also not sure what the drug trip had to do with things in the woods.\n\nI think the ending ties back to what the guy said earlier about wanting to learn to \"humanely trap a rabbit.\" I'm not sure about all the murderous puff balls around the world but it seemed like that line was a setup for the ending in which they were ensnared, but as for where they were going or why I have honestly no idea.\n\n6/10.

Sci-fi movies nearly always have to deal with the \u201cexplanation\u201d for the supernatural content they introduce in films and Save Yourselves! generated some poor reviews because of the dissatisfaction audiences had with the explanation part.

Jack and Su are easy to like, and their relationship never seemed on the verge of destruction due to arbitrary or forced reasons. Which is great change of pace not having to worry about that. Their wholesome naivety made for a delightful dynamic, and had me smiling throughout. \n\nIt reminded me of when I watched Palm Springs, and felt a relaxing comfort in how upbeat the movie was, even for technically being in crisis lol. Also like Palm Springs, the chemistry from the 2 leads was fantastic!! It's probably what carried the movie for me, and both of their performances were so damn fun to watch. \n\nYou know what, I don't hate the ending. I DEFINITELY see why people would dislike it, but the dinosaur conversation in the very beginning of the movie did allude to this kind of ending. I think the ambiguity does hurt the ending a bit, but the title of the movie is literally Save Yourselves. It's not trying to give justification for who would or should be saved, but just a backdrop for our characters journey as well as their saving grace. Hell the girl who steals their car and abandons the baby isn't even given a karmic death.\n\nI think the point of the ending is about self reflection. Not the pods itself (as again, they don't choose good or evil), but the movies choice to end on that. They grew and bettered themselves and got rewarded. Will everyone be rewarded? No. But that shouldn't stop people from trying.

Just left a viewing of it. Amazing writing. Bill and Rashida are so great to watch, I wish it was an hour longer!!!!", "Honestly not that impressed with this. At every turn the movie resists giving you anything more than the most obvious, surface thing, making the characters and relationships feel hollow.\n\nBiggest issue for me is the character of Laura. I like Rashida Jones but she doesn't have a ton of spark or dramatic range as an actress and Laura isn't given enough personality to connect to in the first place. We're given no indication of what life outside of her father and family would even look like, are we? She's a writer in a rut but we have no idea what she writes about or even what she's interested in, giving us only a few cursory shots of her staring at a blank laptop screen. The only friendship that's even hinted at is Jenny Slate, who just serves as comic relief as Laura spends those scenes staring off completely uninterested. And there's no specificity with her relationship with the kids, just coming across as a bland movie mom. I know the rut is the point but the movie doesn't make her ennui compelling. Compare her to, I don't know, Charlize Theron in Tully as an example of a character like this that feels like a full rounded human being who has an inner life and motivations beyond what the movie's plot needs her to do. There's just seems to be very little to explore with this person.\n\nHer relationship with Felix is where the movie needs to open up and get interesting but even that is lacking in much nuance. The dynamic is set up immediately but never seems to develop. He's a philandering charmer and she rolls her eyes and says some sarcastic thing in response to his tangents, the movie content with just hitting this note over and over again. Even when she blows up at him near the end she hits the obvious notes again (cheating is wrong, you're selfish, your schemes are getting old, etc), making it feel like there's nothing going on besides the most surface level attributes that are directly related to the plot. The movie tries to \"cheat\" a genuine goofy family relationship between the two with the whistling thing too but it isn't convincing enough.\n\nAnd the revelation that Dean wasn't cheating was deeply unsatisfying, not because of the result but how it was all executed. The movie works too hard for too long to make you believe he *is*, to the point where some of his actions in earlier scenes don't make sense in retrospect (why would he act so obviously paranoid with his phone in the scene where she asks for his passcode?). It felt cheap and manipulative. And similar to Laura and Felix his character isn't given any specificity or life beyond the basics of what pertains to the plot so there's nothing to latch onto when the truth is revealed. Also in the end Jones and Wayans' lack of on-screen chemistry suddenly works against the movie instead of for it, as you don't really buy it when they make up.\n\nBill Murray is as enjoyable as ever (how can he not be?) but I realized a while ago that he can only do so much to make a shallow character-driven dramedy interesting, and with this movie it's too little too late. I kept trying to find something compelling in this movie and never found it. I'm extra disappointed because Coppola usually gives you a bit more to chew on and anyone could have made this.", "Disappointing and supremely dull. \n\nThe writing of Laura as a character was very one dimensional and Rashida Jones just doesn\u2019t have enough charisma as a lead to make up for it, especially when splitting scenes with Bill Murray. \n\nAs soon as the husband said he had a second gift for her, it was very obvious to me that he wasn\u2019t cheating on her. The reveal of the Cartier box at the end was a Chekhov\u2019s Gun I saw from a mile away. \n\nFurthermore, I felt like they only really scratched the surface of the themes they were trying to explore. As the daughter of a cheating father, I expected to relate to this film on a deeper level. But even the climax\u2019s fight was uninspired and half baked. I wished they explored more of Laura\u2019s fears of the impact her partner\u2019s affair could have on her own daughters, or dove deeper into her trauma and learned distrust of men as a result of her dad. Overall, it just seemed like a real missed opportunity.", "So I was a little bit \u201cmovie intoxicated\u201d as the last film I saw in theaters was Goodfellas about 7 months ago. \n\nThat being said, I think this was her best work since Somewhere. \n\nSPOILER:\nI still think he was cheating on her.

Bill Murray was honestly the only thing that kept this from being a complete waste of time.\n\n4/10", "Absolutely loved this. The chemistry between Bill Murray & Rashida Jones is fantastic and I really wish it was a bit longer so we could have had more of them just being father & daughter on screen. I wanted more of their night time NYC adventures together. It\u2019s a really simple, super sweet and funny film and a great New York movie too. Just lovely.", "Pretty interesting film. It's nowhere near as beautiful or poignant as Lost in Translation, which will be the obvious comparison here, but it certainly had some interesting characters and things to say about aging relationships, as well as some scenes of Bill Murray just having a great time which is always a plus.\n\nAt first I thought this movie was about how men make a distinction between women in general and their daughters or women they really know specifically, and I think that's certainly a big part of it. Bill Murray seems obsessed with how different cultures deal with the imbalance between men and women and even though he's very flirtatious and philandering, he is totally different around Rashida and his grand-daughters. And it's not just because they're related, it's because he really knows them.\n\nI think this movie had some pacing issues. The setup is solid with her daily life and hints that Marlon is cheating, but most of the movie until the very end is devoid of learning anything new concrete to support that either way. It actually kind of bugged me that the movie was written to seemingly convince us that he was cheating but I think we are supposed to be in Rashida's shoes whose thoughts are being guided by her father who was a philanderer and therefore probably sees it in everyone.\n\nI thought it was an interesting reveal that he wasn't cheating and that Bill Murray is actually just old and lonely and looking for reasons to spend time with his daughter. He is actually the most interesting character, I thought the most interesting part was when Rashida point blank asked him about his affair and he just got very sad. You could see he had love for Holly and even though he regretted everyone in the situation being sad he simply knows who he is and that it happened. He was an interesting character because he knows he has control over people to an extent and he wields it very freely. This is shown by the scene where they get pulled over, and the ultimate reveal is that he was using it on Rashida as well. She could see him doing it to everyone but not to her.\n\nI don't know, I'm feeling a good 7/10 on this. I thought it would be lower and honestly I was hoping for a more complex result to the story than he wasn't cheating at all if only because Murray's backstory seemed relatively complex and I thought that would be the idea that these matters are just difficult to navigate, but I think at the end despite not having the most complex plot the characters we got were worth meeting and feeling with.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "I watched this at NYFF. So I had quite some time to establish my thoughts. It feels as if all of Sofia Coppola's ideas were lost in translation. On the Rocks is founded on the concept of subjectivity in a marriage and its ability to tarnish it, yet the (major) events that catalyze the ripples and insecurities are purely objective. (The phone and deleted messages, husband arrived on a bed seemed to be turned off by his wife, the husband not being at home during for long period of times ). Yes some of these are explained later on, but Rashida Jones wasn\u2019t wrong in pursuing this \u2018\u2019mission\u2019\u2019. It instantly created a disconnect between me and the movie, and the underwhelming conclusion only amplified the issue. Bill Murray\u2019s character is played a little too likable for his misogynistic character, and I think doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s always entertaining though, and has this nice relaxed flow to the movie. Also, the way Coppola portrayed NYC is infectious. The restaurants, constant name dropping, and driving around is a lot of fun. But as a whole, kind of a mess. Never boring though.", "Really disappointed by the film. Within the first ten minutes I knew Coppola was going to be resting on the laurels of Lost in Translation for this, and it seemed to be attempting to recreate or imitate it so badly. Yet, for all the wanting, it misses the mark terribly, both as imitation and on its own merits.\n\nI\u2019m all about moody/bleak lighting and remote/vague ambient soundtracks (which is what Lost in Translation captures so well), but this felt downright depressing and lacking in any artsiness or moodiness to make it worthwhile. The grey/blue undertones made Rashida Jones pretty unflattering, which is saying something because she is a natural beauty. It made Murray look like he was at death\u2019s door in some scenes. Might have been okay if Coppola was specifically striving for that, but I actually don\u2019t think she was.\n\nIt was pretty irritating to see everything magically work out for all characters. I get it, it\u2019s a movie, there\u2019s that suspension of disbelief we engage in, but the weird mix of trying to make it hyper-real (characters don\u2019t look very good, unremarkable clothing) was off-putting; is this supposed to be more real or not? The fantastical shenanigans grew tiresome.\n\nAnother big problem I had was that Rashida Jones has zero chemistry with Wayans. Wayans comes across as a Hallmark movie kind of character- good looking, has \u201ccharming\u201d lines, etc. But we never see them actually in love. Even the wedding scene was very forced and contrived. \n\nThe trip to Mexico was totally unnecessary. There surely was a better way for Jones to discover he wasn\u2019t ever cheating. I was hoping there would be more to Jones and Murray\u2019s \u201cblowout\u201d, but it was more of the same that she had been saying the entire of movie.\n\nThe ending was beyond cheesy and simplistic. Mom in a rut gets out of her rut, writes exactly what she needs to write, and learns to whistle again to boot? Come on. It\u2019s easy and simple and lacks nuance and a touch of reality. One doesn\u2019t forget to whistle, of all things, when they are in a rut. \n\nI don\u2019t regret watching it, I don\u2019t think it was necessarily a waste of time, but it\u2019s clear Coppola glorifies the inane and idle lives of the wealthy who putter around fantastic cities weeping \u201cwoe is me\u201d because their relationship isn\u2019t going well. It was the same in Lost in Translation (though to a lesser degree, I admit this film is more about the uncertainty of your twenties and feeling disconnected, a film I actually love), and Marie Antoinette. Ffs give women some depth beyond their part in a relationship.", "Honestly struggling with takeaways from this one...\n\nAs another user pointed out, it's a study of the relationship to famous fathers, a trait Coppola and Jones both share. The revelation that happens for Rashida in Mexico is mundanely fit into the film, and she doesn't really react beyond not engaging with her father anymore. That really makes it unclear why she can't separate her husband from her father - even though she obviously adores her father. Others call out his philandering, but I was more interested in the abandonment issues that the plot makes play out quite literally. In that sense, I see why she wants to cut ties with dad, but it's truly never resolves. Her relationship with her husband was also somewhat bizarre in how obviously they were off - into immediately resolving back to their love. \n\nLoved Murray's singing and playfulness, paired with his one moment of despair. My favorite shot, was her in bed - slow panning to the robo vacuum hitting the walls - a perfect metaphor.", "Just having a quick read through this thread: am I the only one who thought he *was* cheating?\n\nEdit: to clarify \u2014 I still thought he was/did/is at the end of the movie.", "I wonder if Sofia recognized this personal, specific industry similarity with Rashida.\n\nSofia Coppola and Rashida Jones similarity comes through both being accused of nepotism through being hooked up to the industry through their fathers. Wonder if this thing lil connection made Sofia bring the best performance out Rashida.\n\nBoth rightly *earned* their talented labels.", "I see some discussion about whether Marlon Wayans was cheating, but I didn't even care by the end. Bill Murray plays a creepy rich scumbag, Rashida plays bored mom, and Marlon is busy work guy. There's no memorable lines, the whistling was grating, there's a scene where the daddy issues are addressed, and a lot like real life, they're ignored and moved past as if nothing was ever said. \n\nSeeing rich people being bored just isn't for me. New York is as played out as a city can be for film, and it added nothing to the film other than some cheap pop shots. If this had some jokes, or a fun character or two, it could have been entertaining.", "Simple, brisk, and ultimately forgettable. There's not really much to hate but there's little to love, it's a film without substance. However, I do appreciate that the film never descended into melodrama. \n\nAt this point I'm done with dull nothing-films about wealthy New Yorkers.", "I thought this was a very competently made but very boring film. A few thoughts:\n\n\nIs Rashida willing or able to be cast as anything other than the anxious/no fun spouse? Her character reminded me so much of I Love You Man, just the kind of lame-o wife who is fine partner but no fun. \n\n\nMarlon Wayans is either a bad actor or his character was poorly written. Probably a combo of both. \n\n\nBill Murray is still fun, but the schtick is def getting stale. \n\n\nI liked that them being upper middle class, multi racial (I know rashidas dad is Quincy), achieving minorities wasn\u2019t dwelled on. Found that refreshing. I\u2019m a straight white male, sorry if that opinion triggers anyone. \n\n\nKnew he wasn\u2019t cheating almost immediately. All felt pretty contrived knowing that. \n\n\nOverall just a boring movie. Attractive visually, good enough performances (not marlon), believable dialogue but weakish script, weak characters, weaker plot.", "Very underwhelming end. It felt like they ran out of money and couldn't finish production, so just went with this. Also, in a few scenes the sound editing was way off.

I quite like Sofia Coppola\u2019s films (The Bling Ring is seriously underappreciated) and I\u2019m a massive fan of Bill Murray so I really enjoyed On the Rocks. Manages to be light entertainment that has some meaningful substance to it - the father/daughter relationship, their intergenerational divide, the ideas of gender that come with that divide, the amount of comfort & privilege afforded by these characters, and the challenges of domesticity faced by the lead. Rashida Jones & Bill Murray are both terrific and have wonderful chemistry.", " Bill Murray is electric in this and that is enough for me.", "I think there\u2019s a lot of things to like about the film, the way the city of New York is filmed is gorgeous, Bill Murray and Rashida Jones are both very charismatic, and I enjoyed the journey Sofia took me on throughout the film.\n\nWhen Laura and her father were having that deep conversation on why he cheated and ultimately broke up their family and he mentioned that her mother was suddenly busy with their kids and he felt neglected as a result, I figured it was going to be something similar happening with Marlon Wayan\u2019s character. It kinda would have been a 500 days of summer type deal where we have seen the whole thing from an unreliable narrator\u2019s perspective (Laura) but in reality there\u2019s a whole other side to the story (Dean). But ultimately it turns out he was just working hard to provide and it was two or three small coincidences that Felix exacerbated in order to spend time with his daughter. So I guess I\u2019m struggling to understand what the underlying message is, going to let it digest in my dreams tonight and maybe I\u2019ll have something in the morning.", "I don\u2019t know why this is rated R.

Every scene the husband and wife had together seemed so unnatural and poorly written. It was lined up so the husband obviously looked like a cheater but then it was completely reversed at the end, despite the fact the marriage never felt believable.

Sofia\u2019s one of my favorite directors, and Lost in Translation is a top 10 all-time movie for me. But the pacing was off and the writing was lackluster \u2014 and as much as I love Rashida I don\u2019t think she has that je nais se quois for a role like this. That blow-up argument with her dad in Mexico could have been an emotional gut punch in the hands of a more capable actress, but with Rashida it felt flat, rehearsed, stilted. Cinematography was nice at least, though not in the way Sofia\u2019s films usually are.", "I enjoyed this movie and I'm happy I saw it at the cinema, a solid 3/5 in my opinion. My only issue is the ending, which came off disingenuous. \n\nI think it was pretty obvious for most of the movie that Dean wasn't actually cheating, so I wasn't bothered with that reveal, but that their fight on the street was so simple and quick. \n\nHis behaviour gave real reason to doubt him and things like making out with her while on valium then snapping out of it and being weird, or how close he was with his female colleague in general or how he left Laura to do all the work and was pretty absent, all that gets left alone, Laura doesn't bring any of it up. Dean also doesn't make any issue of his wife distrusting him enough to stalk him and follow him to Mexico. It's alllll gooooood, just a one minute conversation and everything is solved somehow. That felt hollow. \n\nBill Murray as Felix kept the laughs coming and it was enjoyable for what it is.", "This movie was TERRIBLE. My biggest problem with it was the lack of edge.

Cool concept and executed well.\n\nI thought the ending was going somewhere slightly different though.\n\n>!spoiler I thought that after the Colin inside Tasya's memories scene that he was going to take over her body when she got out of the possession machine.

The family killing could have played out similarly but it feels more sinister if it's from her own hands.!<", "I can't say I felt bored while watching it but I also feel like I would be upon a rewatch because there's very little happening beneath the surface. I just didn't give a shit about either of the characters because they both felt incredibly hollow. Maybe that was the point, but everyone just felt and sounded like they were on ambien. Christopher Abbott definitely gives the best performance considering how much range he has to have to pull off the different levels of how much his character is in control, but Riseborough did a solid enough job. \n\nThe gore didn't quite live up to the hype for me, but I guess I'm also pretty desensitized. Idunno. I'm just not entirely sure what I was supposed to get out of it but the whole thing left me feeling pretty underwhelmed.", "This movie is pretty bonkers and honestly I loved it. The concept, the effects, the psychological aspects, the acting, the gore, all very on point. Brandon really nails his father's 80's Videodrome/Brood/Scanners vibes but still makes it feel very modern and new. Really a cool thing to see.\n\nI thought the concept of possessing people to get them to assassinate was really well explored. The company she works for and its goals, the psychological effects of going under and how it affects Vos even when she's back in her own mind, etc. I think the point of the interviews was to show us how she's losing a little but of herself and her humanity every time she goes under. The first time she was asked about the butterfly she said she still felt bad about killing it, and at the end when asked again she simply remembers the butterfly but doesn't mention any feelings surrounding it.\n\nA lot of what the movie is saying is nicely on the surface. It's not really told to us but we can see that she enjoys going under to the point of lying about her well being. We can also see she always goes for the more violent kill despite having a gun. I think it can be about how people can be desensitized to violence or a certain toxic way of life over time, going back to how she loses a little bit of herself every time she does it.\n\nMovie got really interesting after she pulled off the assassination but couldn't get out of the body as well. The actor she was possessing was doing a great job of going between the two very confused minds. I loved the imagery of her wearing the loose mask standing outside her ex's house. The moment earlier in the movie where she has to remind herself how to be herself, but this time it's as the possessed who is wearing a mask of her. There was so much great imagery and so many crazy ideas about identity and motivation shown in those trippy sequences that I really want to see it again.\n\nOverall, I'd call this a solid 8/10. Anyone who loves Cronenberg should feel really great that we are looking at another young career that keeps that flame burning. I would pretty much recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi or just hard violence.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "I adored this but it wasn't without its flaws. My main issue is that they put most of Tasya's character development into the second job of the movie, but that also happens to be almost the entire movie. The result was some scenes towards the end that dragged a bit.\n\nI think what would have worked better for me was more focus on the concept and her internal struggles and less about the second individual job and those characters. It would've worked to have an assassination job in between the opener and the main story of the movie to drive home the behavioral issues Tasya was experiencing when she went under. That to me would highlight the best parts of the movie which were the assassinations, and it would have still maintained the high concept feel without diving into slasher territory. I dunno, it felt like 10% opening scene and 95% rest of the movie around the second plot. Maybe 10% opening scene job, 30% second job expanding on her loss of control issues, and 60% main plot where everything blows up. \n\nBut I digress. It still kicks ass.", "I went into this movie expecting body horror, given it\u2019s a Cronenberg movie, even if it\u2019s his son. And I was kind of satisfied, though I wanted more. The way she violently assassinates her targets, despite having a gun she can use to do it quickly, speaks to the fragility of her mental state. The premise of the film, in any other hands, would just be a straightforward action movie, but I love how Cronenberg took the concept and twisted it to be as disturbing as he could. The scene where Vos\u2019 body was being deconstructed and then reconstructed as Colin was equal parts gross and fascinating. It was my second favorite scene, with my first being Colin popping her head, and then wearing it like a cheap mask while experiencing her memories. It\u2019s something done so many times in other movies, but not in such a creepy way. \n\nAgain, this could have been a dull action film, but Cronenberg twisted it ever so slightly to make it a interesting examination of consequence free violence and the loss of oneself by incorporating the body horror elements his father is known for. Pretty good movie, could have been better but I was more than satisfied", "Brandon Cronenberg has learned a lot from his father plus vape.", "Sweet baby Jesus, that movie was a ride. \n\nEssentially a love letter to the 80's sci-fi horror from whence Brian Cronenberg came. So many gorgeous shots (the possessing scene!!? \ud83d\ude0d), and just as many disturbing ones.\n\nThe performance by Christopher About was really good! Captured the out-of-bodiness of it all. \n\nSure, could've used a little more character development, but it is what it is: a tribute to 80's sci-fi horror. And he does that oh so well. \n\n9/10", "the scene where she \"transports\" into the victim was easily my favorite part of the film. it felt oddly euphoric. my only criticism of the film was that it was way too handheld and shakeu. i think it couldve pulled off that clinical and deliberate feel like Contagion by sitting that damn camera on a tripod!", "This was like Inception meets Under the Skin. Slick movie.", "The most horrific thing was the data mining scene. I'm gonna tape my web cam now", "I really enjoyed this, especially the camera work and sound design, plus the props/practical effects involving the possessor technology. \n\nOne question: what was the intent of seeing Sean Bean post-attack with Vas? We see this very briefly (I\u2019m pretty sure but might be wrong on the timeline) around when Eddie shows up at the apartment where Colin is hiding out. Bean\u2019s injuries look to be much older in the few shots we get of him with his eyepatch and scarred cheek (visible in the trailer too, if I remember right). What\u2019s the point of these quick glimpses, and why do they appear at this time in the film?", "I think this is my favorite film of 2020 so far (that came out in 2020). All of the criticisms I'm seeing in this thread were (I think) intentional aspects of making the film. I would recommend people watch Antiviral before this film, if possible (or watch it after). Brandon Cronenberg is interested in making slower films that make you squirm a bit and really draw out the larger themes. But I don't think a slow film = a boring one or even one that drags. Nicolas Winding Refn's films are incredibly slow (I enjoyed Valhalla Rising, but I fell asleep 3 times during it and had to finish it in segments), but nearly every shot is a piece of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne art, and I usually connect to the larger themes and the message of what he's trying to get across.\n\nCronenberg has a bit of Refn in him, and I mean that as the highest compliment. The film is very methodically paced, but I don't think the pacing is poor or lazy or was unintentionally done that way. It has a hypnotic effect, and I think BC paced it exactly as he intended to. This is not a film that is going to lead you by the hand and it might not even have an exact ending/interpretation way we can read it, which is done on purpose and is something I love. I don't know about other people, but I don't love art that has a blaring neon sign at the end that says THIS FILM IS ABOUT THIS, HERE'S THE EXACT ENDING. I think the best art is purposefully at least slightly open-ended and vague and confusing and open to multiple readings. The best art says something about the person who experiences it in the way that person reads it or reacts to it. You can interpret the film in a few ways.\n\nI see a reading of the film that says that Tasya has essentially become a legal serial killer, enjoying the murders she gets to enact and taking her time to do them and enjoying the blood and violence, to the point where she wants to kill her own family to be totally free of all entanglements, so she uses the Colin Tate job as a chance to do that with as few complications as possible. Does Colin truly take over their joint mind or does she \"let\" him during key times to make it seem like she can't kill herself as him yet and pull out of his mind? Why does Girder say leave her in his mind when it seems like he's taken over and she's bleeding profusely in real life? What are Girder's motivations during this whole thing, considering she wants Tasya to take over for her role and she discusses the string from Tasya's head to her family that still exists?\n\nThe butterfly is also a key aspect of Tasya's transformation to being more and more of a sociopath. Earlier in the film, she says she felt bad about killing it (does she actually? Or is she losing herself and she thinks this is what Girder wants to hear so Girder will let her keep going in and letting her do what she truly loves, murdering people in increasingly brutal, violent ways?), but, at the end, suddenly that aspect is missing. And Girder smiles a bit at the end when she *doesn't* say she feels bad about killing the butterfly anymore.\n\nI also think the full character development is there, but it's treated as a jigsaw puzzle with a few missing pieces that we have to put together. We might not have 100% of the full picture on everything, but that's life.... when do you get *all* of the information you want perfectly about something in real life? The film is a snippet of Tasya's job and life, and we are left to piece things together from the snippets we get. Why is she estranged from Michael and her son Ira? Again, we don't know for sure, but we can guess based on how much her job seems to have fucked with her psyche, to the point where she (arguably) brutally murders her family at the end. She repeats/acts out what she'll say to Michael multiple times to try to make it sound as normal as possible, presumably because she's concerned that if she doesn't practice it, it will sound flat or dead or unconvincing... also something that points to her going down the path of being more and more sociopathic IMO.\n\nAnd I'm only scratching the tip of the iceberg here, I think there's a fuckton more you can unpack from this film. It has a bunch of layers and depth, which is why I loved it so much. Can't wait to watch it again when I force someone to watch it with me, haha. This video also has a great reading/interpretation of the film and makes some interesting points:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o820CEWaEig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o820CEWaEig)", "I don't seem to see this theory anywhere, but through 2 viewings, I still think she liked to escape her reality because she hated her former lover and felt nothing for her son (kind of contradictory things for this one). She stabbed and killed the men brutally (associating them with Michael) and spared the women with gunshots. Then, she finally saw the opportunity to kill Michael sadistically. \n\nI don't know if killing her son, Ira, was an immediate reaction to the stabbing or if she really felt hate for her son as well. Basically, I just saw her acting out her messed-up feelings through the machine, and every time, she would go back, she would become even more psychologically twisted.", "Another solid Christopher Abbott performance\n\nAnother good NEON movie\n\nAnother instance where Sean Bean's head doesn't fare so well\n\nalso Hanneke Talbot (white girl in the blue track suit in the beginning) looks crazy like Riley Keough", "I noticed one interesting tidbit and hadn't seen anyone else discuss it, so thought I'd bring it up.\n\nWhen visiting her estranged family after the opening assassination, Tasya practices some phrases.  One of these is \"what have you got there?\".  When she goes to the house, she uses the other practiced phrases, but not this one.\n\nTowards the end, when Colin (possessed by Tasya) comes across Ira outside, he says \"what have you got there?\" to the kid.\n\nI just thought that was an interesting touch.", "I don't really know what to think about this movie.

She was not feeling guilty for the butterfly, nor her son.", "Still a bit confused by the ending. I mean I kinda think I know what happened, but why would the main character be cool with what happened?", "Meh", "I kind of felt like it didn't flesh out all of the interesting concepts presented. \n\nI guess it's not really a flaw in the film, but a choice. Still, I wanted to see more possessions, learn more about the characters, setting, etc. It's a similar feeling I had with the film \"Upgrade\" where they really only give you a small slice at what looks like a fascinating universe.

Also, the \"I'm a Christian, I can't kill\" line paired with a fresh body in the next room and \"I'm a fan of your recent stabbing\" absolutely sent me. The mix of the visuals and gore gave me strong Hannibal vibes too.\n\nAll in all I loved this take on the idea of switching bodies and  the existentialist horror you'd feel to be in another's body. The visuals were gorgeous and the attention to sound design was solid (the little crunch when the poker was removed from the back of the guy's mouth) although I wish the plot ended somewhere a little more concrete. It felt weird to introduce clear cut story devices with so much detail (a corporate coup) only for the pistol to be left mounted on the wall.", "I really like Christopher Abbott, so I thought this was a cool, interesting role for him. I really only had sympathy for him, and was hoping that the film would have some sort of positive note for him, but obviously...not gonna happen, ha. I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, but I\u2019m still a little disappointed because I didn\u2019t like Tasya or Girder at all.\n\nI\u2019m not really into this body horror sort of genre, I prefer just genuine scares, and I had to look away a couple times, gagged once, but I still enjoyed it, thought it was a good way to spend a couple hours. Some of the visuals are really striking and interesting, especially the mask Colin wears. I dug it.", "After reflection and reading the comments I think the best explanation for the ending is that she either wanted to kill her family all along or JJL's character was pushing her towards that oath the whole time. That's why JJL went into her son and why she was happy that that she was no longer guilty about the butterfly. Basically she was made into the perfect unfeeling assassin", "What I loved:\n- the future yet no so future Black Mirror aspect of it\n- the layers on layers on layers scene when she was mining\n- the weird limbo space between the minds\n- the whole \"miner\" concept as neo-grunt work reinvented in the 21st century in a terrifying yet real way\n\nWhat I was bummed by:\n- the gore / even graphic sex just wasn't necessary. I get it's cronenberg's kid, but it didn't drive the plot forward or anything.. e.g. in Fight Club the graphic sex / violence had a functional purpose within the story, here it just felt random / unnecessary\n- the ending.. I wanted way more, and felt like I deserved way more\n- the second half in general was good but kind of a buzz kill / felt kind of random\n- I really wanted to see more of the company, why they wanted zoothroo and what their plans were. I was half expecting them to run up against another company in the process leading to some crazy possession battle between orgs.\n\nLike there were so many absolutely masterful bits that almost no one could or even tries to pull off.. it was refreshingly rich.\n\nBut then it became consumed by the bizarre and ultimately fell to like an 8 at most.\n\nI was satisfied yet disappointed.", "Andrea Riseborough is a force of nature.\n\nEdit: I watched the leaked version, and will be renting this when it's available regardless.

A lot of the surreal moments and technical flares throughout are really cool to look at and feel eery and unsettling. The score too is fantastic and just adds to the uncomfortableness of it all.

Christopher Abbott was real good too and that dude is someone to look out for, he takes really interesting roles. \n\nI had a lot of fun spotting all the Toronto locations. It makes the city look kind of gross, similar in the way Enemy did, but it also made it look kind of cool as well. \n\nIt's a very intense watch though and the violence is hyperrealistic. I had to cover my eyes a bit at times for how brutal it is. There's no 'fun' in this movie, and that's the biggest difference I can see from David Cronenberg's work that Brandon brings. David's work usually has a bit of campiness to it. This movie is fucking raw, and brutal, and so much so that I think it would be hard for me to watch again. \n\nAnd there's also this very Canadian film vibe to it? The cinematography is gorgeous, and I can't quite put my finger on it, but just growing up here you get a sense for it. I feel like (despite its subject matter) it could be run on the CBC. \n\nDefinitely a cool watch and I enjoyed a lot about it. I just think maybe it might be a too bleak and fatalistic for me. I need just a little camp. Also, it's a little pretentious and not in the good way.", "Girder's ridiculously circuitous plan is unfortunately where the movie starts to fall apart for me. Including Eddie, snatching the boy up for 5 hours to do surgery on the off-chance Colin would come to kill her family, the high chance of Tas brain damage; it all seems highly unlikely to succeed if it was a part of a premeditated plan. It also doesn't fit the modus operandi of the company.\n\nBrutally killing the father and girlfriend makes sense since the narrative is Colin resents them. You could even spin Colin killing his (would be?) mistress and Eddie in her apartment as Eddie seems to have a reputation as a horn dog based on the way he brags about his sexual exploits at work during his introduction scene. It could be theorized by the police that Eddie was sleeping with her and Colin found out about it. But then you have Colin stalking and killing this random boy and his father for no reason. The police will no doubt backtrack and find video of Tas as Colin coming to peep through the window at them a few nights ago before Colin becomes publicly unstable. Since one of the themes of the movie is the complete loss of privacy, no doubt there are security cameras EVERYWHERE in the future. The kill doesn't fit the narrative.\n\nAlso given this assassination company is a business which relies heavily on secrecy to not get caught and exactingly following procedures for the tech to succeed. NO WAY they let Tas near it again after all the lying about her condition and how badly she botched this high profile job (Sean Bean lived somehow as mentioned in the news report). Again, given the scope of Girder's plan including Eddie and implanting Ira with the tech, there's no way she could keep the company from discovering how badly Tas screwed the pooch. The circle of players is too large for it not to get back to the higher ups. Even if Tas is supposedly \"good to go\" now, it's too late, the trust is already broken.", "I gave it a 6.5/10.

Like there were some fun ideas, pretty decent effects, decently shot, ok soundtrack but they couldn't pull it together.  The writer/director made the all too common mistake of crawling up their own ass, they were too far up there to see that they really didn't bring anything terribly profound.  I guess they were trying to push an environmental message, which so many others have done better, something about relationships or fathers and sons, IDK.\n\nThe way they 'changed' the past/future wasn't earned in any way and all predicated on the lazy 'I've got a secret' forced drama, I mean they tried to flesh it out with flashbacks etc.  It's a pity, because this is a good looking movie that's really reaching for something, but like many movies they didn't spend the time or money on a script that's you know actually good, lots of fun ideas you might spit ball for a movie, then slapped down in to a 3/10 script.", "The film was absolute silly shoes.

This was one of the best apartment sets I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019m sure it was a set, but it felt lived in, comfy, and quintessentially New York. The screenplay, almost entirely lifted from Matt Crowley\u2019s original play is sad, funny, and an interesting look into pre-Stonewall gay friendship. I\u2019m definitely seeking out the William Friedkin 1970 adaptation. \n\nAlso, as a friendly PSA, I should let you know Matt Bomer goes full frontal within the first ten minutes.", "Harold cracked me up with how absurd he was.

If not, what was he so upset about?\n\nI enjoyed this way more than I expected to. I was really into it and there were so many fun characters, namely Emory and Tex. I also enjoyed Hank's inclusion because not all gay men act or dress the same and he was quite different. Also because bisexuals often get left out, I feel. \n\nI wish Matt Bomer had more to do but he certainly was beautiful. Michael's reaction to seeing him undressed was totally relatable. \n\nI really wanted them to explore what the deal was between Harold and Donald though. I guess the bad blood there was meant as a foil to the viciousness that Michael and Harold show each other but still.

The concept of \u201cas much as you want to you will never change, you will always be gay\u201d and the amount of self loathing that would be instilled in any queer during this time (not saying present day is perfect either) is so tragic. Definitely doing a deep dive on the original works after this.", "I really enjoyed it, the acting was phenomenal all around. That apartment set was amazing, it had like everything from a loft to the balcony. I\u2019m guessing it was meant to show how Michael was living beyond his means because that felt like almost too nice of an apartment. Michael himself surprised me with how almost cruel he got as he became more and more drunk. I thought at the end when he left the apartment he might kill himself, it felt like an idea that kept popping up throughout the movie.\n\nThe passive aggressive banter is totally my style, feel like that\u2019s something only true friendships have.

I really enjoyed how flaming Emory was and how at the same time not necessarily over the top.  Some queer folks do act like that. Hank was great because he was very straight passing. His bisexuality was great, and I appreciate how he didn\u2019t really play into queer stereotypes. \n\nI was warned that Jim Parson drops an N bomb but to be honest i was more triggered by Alan\u2019s homophobia. \n\nOverall I thought the film was great at exploring gay male sexuality and their friendships. They seemed like a fun bunch.", "I watched this last night and can't stop thinking about it. It touches on themes specific to 1968 New York, but I feel, as a gay British 21 year old, that it resonates hugely to life now too. \n\nThe exploration of suppression of love because of the heteronormativity was so poignant. I can't think of that one person I would call, but it doesn't matter because each of them represents the general idea of unrequited love, which sometimes you couldn't even fully admit to yourself. And then the way in which their sexualities had become known to them differing, and because of the suppressive world they grew up in they struggled to express it. \n\nI'm recommending this film to everyone.

Some of the deeper dives into each character felt a little cliched and repetitive, but still interesting.

I absolutely hated this movie. Horrendously regressive and frankly annoying. I realize the original was a big deal, and I should probably pretend as if I enjoyed this just because it\u2019s set in a historical time frame, but as a gay person, it\u2019s becoming really obnoxious seeing this level of self-loathing in our films. I don\u2019t understand why anyone would want to feel this down, dirty, and depressed after a film right now. \n\nEmory is an absolute star. Completely stole the show for me. I need more Robin De Jesus on my screen.\n\nIt\u2019s 2020 - I would love a major film with a gay main character that isn\u2019t about being in the closet, filled with self loathing or dying from AIDS. There\u2019s been enough of this narrative. call me by your name and Brokeback Mountain, our two \u201cbiggest\u201d love stories are just depressing expressions of homosexual love. We need more realistic fun love stories without all the stereotypes.

I kept thinking to myself \u201cwho says a thing like that?!\u201d. I watched the whole thing but I wasn\u2019t having much fun. Harold was obnoxious. Michael too bitter to like. Someone attacks your friend and you don\u2019t kick him out of the house? Not just that but also Emory seems to forgive him so quickly that I just couldn\u2019t believe the plot.

Everyone in this movie just goes all-in on the dumbest ideas these characters come up with. I think if the actors held back at all this film wouldn't work as well as it does. The parents are the funniest mix of creepy yet non-threatening people that live just on an entirely different plane of existence. It's a very funny and interesting character-driven movie that reminds me of a lot of \u2018Sorry To Bother You\u2019 and \u2018I Don't Feel At Home In This World Anymore\u2019.

Went in expecting slapstick comedy, but came out heartbroken. Overall loved the movie and I found it relatable on many levels.\n\nOne thing that bugged me was how Dolio's parents managed to clean the whole place out without either of them noticing. But considering the rest of the movie, it wasn't the oddest thing I saw.", "I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie but I really loved it. The trailer had such beautiful music and imagery that I knew I'd see it but I didn't think it would be a contender for favorite movie this year, although I still really love Emma. \n\nI feel like a lot of this movie can come off as comedic but truthfully almost every scene left me heartbroken. From the very first scam they pull when Old Dolio agrees to the massage but can't handle even the slightest touch to the very last scene, even though this movie is about con artists they somehow find clever ways to weave in the themes of yearning for love from a normal family into every single scene and scam they pull. \n\nEvan Rachel Wood is so good here. Almost unrecognizable. The way the idea of a loving parental relationship consumes her is so sad and a little bit funny due to her execution. The whole cast is amazing though. Richard Jenkins is an actual treasure, Debra Winger is great and while I thought Gina Rodriguez's character would be really annoying at first she quickly became my favorite. \n\nThe themes are unsubtle, but weaved in well enough I didn't mind. Old Dolio wants a somewhat normal relationship and life but was born to very unconventional parents who think of everything in terms of cash value and not in terms of emotional connection. Old Dolio is less their daughter as she is someone who expands their range of scams and takes her rightful third of the score. This is highlighted by the fact that they even sold out her name to a homeless man in hopes of getting some of his lottery winnings.\n\nGina Rodriguez's character has everything Old Dolio doesn't. An apartment, possessions, a job, a mother who thinks of her and loves her. But she's bored with it all. She wants what Old Dolio has and gets excitement from joining the crew, which Old Dolio sees as stupid. This life is obviously not fun or fulfilling. It's not until the parents reveal their real intentions to sleep with Gina and she sees just how broken Old Dolio is in the following argument that she realizes what she has and what she can give to Dolio.\n\nEvery con they pull seems to remind Old Dolio what she's missing out on. Going to the baby care class, being treated like a stranger by her parents while they dote on this new younger woman on a plane, pretending to be a normal family to lull an old man into death. The saddest moments are when Dolio gets caught up in the moment and lets herself believe she has a family just as the parents shatter the illusion with their focus on the scam.\n\nUltimately, the parents do this one last time in the last stretch of the movie. And it's heart breaking, but in a way it's the best thing they could have done. They said it earlier in the film, that's not who they are. They're not those kinds of parents they simply are who they are. In that way, fleecing Rodriguez's apartment and leaving Dolio with her fair share was their way of saying we are irredeemable but we set you free. It's beautiful and sad and simply the truth of the situation.\n\nThere's a lot to this movie beyond just the themes and characters. The music, the visuals, Gina Rodriguez being a dream. Altogether this was a surprisingly beautiful movie and I hope everyone gets a chance to see it. 8/10.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "There was a lot to love about this movie, from the cast to the music and awkward story line. It felt fresh from the typical movies you find in-between blockbuster movies.

I enjoyed the background about how Old Dolio got her name because r/TodayILearned had a story about something similar with birthing in a chick fil a and the top comment was about someone trying to have their baby in a grocery store for free baby products and how it is a real thing that people would do in the hopes for free things. The ending twist was expected as they built up the tension leading up to the end and thought it was cute how she \"gifted\" wood to Melanie. In the end it felt like an emotional rollercoaster knowing what felt right and wrong and trying understand that this is just how she was raised and how her family were.

The film was very pretentious, slow, boring, and tried to be many things but wound up succeeding at none of them and felt unfocused as a result. I clocked out after >!the public bathroom scene with the stars!<. Worst part was I didn't give a fuck about the family, who had basically two character traits between the three of them. The parents had \"being assholes\" and the daughter had \"being someone who needs some serious help\" before she could get into something like >!the lesbian relationship!< at the end. That felt forced.", "This is both the weirdest and also the best movies i've seen in a while! Like i might just re-watch this for the feels.", "Still digesting the film.\n\nI love the part where they go to con the family at the beginning with the \"catholic school girl\" uniform because Old Dolio (hilarious name omg...) is annoyed with how much they praise their daughter who is a massage therapist (Old Dolio and her family refer to her as a \"masseuse\". Personally I think the label is crass because it undermines the importance of her profession) and needs to work a second \"fancy\" job to get by.  Just that dialogue alone revealed a lot about the characters' beliefs and personalities, and it also got me thinking about capitalism and stuff. Like the constant struggle of hoarding money, but remaining as minimal as possible to the point of dysfunction and starvation - in a way, it's like being cheap is like being greedy. But back to my point: I can totally relate to Old Dolio's jealously and annoyance towards that family's praise because I know exactly what it's like to not be good enough in the eyes of parents. I never received a \"good job\" from my very strict non-affectionate parents. I always felt like a fuck-up for every accomplishment I made even though it was small or ended up failing, and was somewhat jealous of kids who were congratulated for just existing. These type of parents often view their kids as possessions rather than individuals. If their kid isn't successful that means the parent isn't successful, etc. This movie was kind of like therapy much like Old Dolio going to those maternal classes was her version of therapy.\n\nIt was also interesting for the story to reveal a bit about Melanie's mom. Melanie's mom is very much the opposite of Old Dolio's mother yet still the same. She was so smothering, doting but would talk over her, ignore her and think for her, buy her trivial things she didn't need or want (at least that's what I've gathered when she explained the mug warmer). As I'm typing this I'm realizing that's probably why Melanie was so compassionate towards Old Dolio, and that's why she flirted with her so much.\n\nI also thought the tremors were fake and the family was just super paranoid and delusional and that's why they can't keep a job, but no, they're very real and everyone is living the same experience, which is a clever takeaway to explain a metaphor, if that's what's even happening.\n\nI think what made me sad the most was the lonely old man passing away - the one that Melanie described as creepy - which is hilarious because he was just actually really lonely and it's really sad! It's something I think about a lot because a lot of my family members are getting old and I'm not sure who is going to take care of them.

Would she have let them go or kill them but then feel really bad about it?\n\n* Why her talking to her targets is a bad thing is actually never revealed, they end up dead so what do the higher-ups care if she chatted them up first?  One can assume that they were worried she\u2019d uncover some conspiracy, something along the lines that her targets were being taken out for some rather unethical reason, but such a revelation never arrives.\n\n* If Ava is considered one of the best killers in the organization why would they send a guy to simply knife her in a park? Wouldn\u2019t a sniper or a car bomb be a more practical approach for such a dangerous target?\n\n* That Ava buys Duke\u2019s story that the guy she had a brutal fight within the park was just some random addict, and not a professional killer sent by the company to take her out, means she is either incredibly gullible or incredibly stupid\u2026or possibly both.\n\n* The cast is full of movie assassins; Geena Davis played an amnesiac killer in *The Long Kiss Goodnight*, Colin Farrell played the assassin Bullseye in *Daredevil* and John Malkovich played a paranoid hitman in *Red.*", "I remember when this film was first announced and how excited I was.

No.\n\nI actually really enjoyed it. The soundtrack was great. The fight scenes were cool and relatively believable. It was a nice mix of Long Kiss Goodnight and John Wick (I'm not just saying that because Geena Davis appears in it).\n\nI think some of the criticisms in this thread are more about wanting this to be a bunch of story twists. It was a story about someone who was too human to keep being an elite assassin. Her emotional mistakes puts everyone she loves at risk. There was no dark secret or conspiracy to reveal.

It's why this fucking conflict starts in the first place and, in the end, he doesn't go through it, for apparently no good reasons at all. And then, he acts fucking surprised that she will kill him.

Intelligent, determined with a strong sense of perseverance.    As intelligent as she was, you could tell she was still not worldly.   She never gave a thought to the Landlady hoodwinking her for the money (convincing Enola her hole in the wall was decent lodging for London) or turning Enola in for the reward money.    I thought it was nice how she was going to open herself up to building a life at the end.  She seemed to stop using \"Enola is Alone spelled backwards\" as an anthem.   That she realizes, even though she's on her own doesn't mean she has to always be alone was a nice message.   Hope to see she and Sherlock eventually bond.\n\nSherlock, I liked HC's interpretation of the character.  We rarely see him so gentile and I thought that made an interesting version.   It was easy to tell Sherlock's default setting is detached but that he wanted to connect to Enola and felt for her not knowing why their mother left without her.  He isn't use to being overly concerned with anyone other than himself but he was genuinely trying with Enola\n\nMycroft was a little one-note but under his icey demeanor, I believe he cares about his siblings, while simultaneously being jealous of both.\n\nTewksbury was a nice counter to Enola.  He was more worldly/savy in some ways and proved to be resourceful in his own right.   By the end of the film I had no issue believing he would be so attached to Enola.\n\nGrandMother Tewksbury - I didn't see coming.   What a truly dark character hidden beneath a benign surface.   What she was willing to do to her own family just to keep the status quo was shockingly sinister, considering this is a kids movie.\n\nEudoria Holmes - Mixed feelings about the kind of person she is.

He's supposed to be as much of a genious as Sherlock, possibly more. \n\nHere, hes just plain unlikeable", "i enjoyed the movie and hope they make a sequel.\nfew things i liked:\n- the way they included scenes of the past as Enola is narrating/explaining something. it felt like it made sense in this movie and it was more natural than other movies ive seen it in.. plus i like the animated parts of it\n- when Tewkesbury grandmother tells Enola she\u2019s been given \u201ea part of England\u201c to protect which ties really nicely with the (detective?) saying he works \u201efor England\u201c right before he dies. think the actor delivered that line perfectly\n- the fact that flowers are leads for Enola to find both her mom and Tewkesbury\n\ni loved the character of Tewkesbury but when i saw my mom reacting to his grandmother shooting him i kinda wish it the character had actually died because it would mean much more somehow? it was like the scene where Enola gets stabbed but not really", "Im actually quite interested in a sequel (with more Sherlock in action)", "Anyone else hoped Tewkesbury would be wearing a corset when he got shot at the end?\n\nBit disappointing that the only major mystery the audience had to work out was \"who wants to kill Tewkesbury?\" Which Enola has more or less told us about halfway through. Then you find out who did and its one random character whose been on screen about two minutes, with the only clue we get being \"it couldn't be the uncle\".\n\nAlso, can I point out how ridiculous that plan was? You're gonna murder two members of your family just to get one vote in your favour in the House of Lords, which you somehow magically know will be decisive?\n\nMaybe I'm overanalysing a kids' movie\n\nAlso found it pretty corny how they made Mycroft such an over-the-top complete bellend, is he like that in original stories?", "Millie Bobby Brown is a successful Natalie Portman clone experiment, I swear. It's uncanny.\n\nShe did a fantastic job leading this, she has such an effortless charisma and wittiness that I feel she hasn't had much opportunity to seize upon. So this was pretty surprising to see. Of course, we've only really seen her in Stranger Things and that Godzilla movie but I think we can expect lots of solid performances for years to come. The performances from all the support are pretty great too, just wish we got to see some more Sherlock and Minecraft.\n\nThe film itself is entertaining and pretty breezy to sit through. It has some standard trappings of your typical YA adaptation but it does a good job of not playing too much into those while maintaining a consistent pace in keeping the audience engaged.\n\nI also like that Enola's character is surprisingly well-written. I thought they would go the Rey route and have her be able to magically solve everything and never need help from anyone. But her journey to independence and self-sufficiency is one paved with necessary failures and required rescue/guidance that helps shape her character arc of becoming her own kind of detective.\n\nAlso, I watched it with my niece who's entering her teens and she loved it. So I thought if anything, Enola serves as a realistic and inspiring figure for younger girls to engage with.", "Millie reminds me of a young Natalie Portman in this film.", "God damn , why are men/boys on Reddit so afraid of women .", "When I first heard about this movie, I honestly thought it sounded terrible. It going to Netflix only reinforced that opinion, because lets be honest Netflix films aren't exactly known for their quality. But I really like Millie Bobby Brown, and I really like Henry Cavill, so I was always going to watch it for them. And I'm really glad I did, Enola Holmes was way better than it had any right to be.\n\nIt's probably not going to win any awards or anything, but it was just a really fun, light-hearted and engaging little adventure movie, and also weirdly enough probably the most just purely entertaining film I've seen all year. Most of it was because of the cast though, Millie Bobby Brown was fantastic in this, Enola was just an extremely charming and likeable character, Brown has so much talent and charisma that I'm now absolutely certain she is going to be a huge star going forward. Henry Cavill surprisingly made a great Sherlock, which I never would have guessed, but he was really suave and cool, which honestly I prefer over the 'creepy eccentric weirdo' portrayals that are so common. The rest of the supporting cast was all equally solid, Tewkesbury's actor in particular was really likeable, and I appreciated that the character wasn't nearly as 'useless' as the other characters made him out to be. And his chemistry with Enola was excellent.\n\nIt had some problems, it definitely slowed down a bit in the middle and pretty much everything involving her mother just turned out to be a sequel hook essentially which was really disappointing. But otherwise this ended up being a really pleasant surprise.", "It's pretty good. Not a masterpiece but it's entertaining. All the cast were great too and Henry Cavill is a good Sherlock Holmes. Also really liked Sam Claflin as Minecraft Holmes. 7/10.", "Honestly I quite liked it. All the characters are well-conceived and Millie Bobby Brown is extremely charming and magnetic. Henry Cavill is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a portrayal of Sherlock where I don\u2019t find myself thinking \u201cwell, this guy would be an insufferable twat\u201d. All in all a very entertaining way to pass an afternoon.", "Late to the party, watching it as we speak.\n\nI like it enough, and I'm enjoying Millie Brown's performance; glad to see she's more than just \"Eleven\". She's kinda funny and decently talented, looking forward to see what else she can do.\n\nI found the scene with Edith (the judo instructor) and Sherlock to be really jarring though. She was really offensive and venemous, laying into Sherlock / calling him names and telling him he's effectively a horrible person because he's not into politics...? Felt weird and almost shoehorned.\n\nThe rest, I enjoyed.", "I thought it was delightful. Enola is spunky, intelligent, charming, relatable, and overall someone who I would have looked up to as a kid. Thoughts:\n\n\\-Maybe I have too much faith in the modern audience but I cannot stand the amount of explanatory flashbacks they stuffed into this movie. It really takes the satisfaction out of a good aha-solved-the-clue moment when they flashback to a scene from 5 minutes ago.\n\n\\-Tewkesbury was a refreshing boy love interest - the dude in distress, as it were. He takes on all the qualities of the stereotypical upper-class/princess love interest (pretty, polished, fussy, a love for softer things, cries). More boys like this on screen please.\n\n\\- I suppose they're setting up for a sequel, but the ending was very abrupt and Enola's mom didn't really explain herself. We figured out what she was doing through Enola's investigation, but Eudoria herself doesn't actually admit anything at the end, nor do we see what her activist group ends up doing. And she never explains why she disappeared out of the blue instead of just telling her daughter that she had a project to go take care of. And then Enola is just cool with it? Felt weird. \n\n\\--GOOD LORD I did not expect Linthorn (murderous henchman) to go out like that.\n\nOverall, this is a fun character I would like to see more of.", "Pretty solid movie overall. It's a bit fun, a bit violent, well acted all around. It was a little all over the place tonally, bouncing between a young protagonist struggling with being a lady to brutally fighting a hitman in the streets, but I appreciated the dip into darkness or else I probably would have been a lot more bored with it. I mean, that dude at the end got straight up blunt force trauama'd to the head.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of movies where the main character is always talking directly to the audience and when she asked us for ideas it was a real Dora the Explorer moment, but considering this is a mystery for presumably a young-ish crowd it didn't bother me too much. I did feel like it wasn't as much of a mystery as I'd hoped. It was definitely there but something like forty minutes into the movie it was feeling a lot more like a YA love story than a mystery.\n\nIn the end, though, there was a mystery afoot and obviously lots of themes of women's rights and voting, which is a nice take considering the time period. I think they wasted Cavill as Holmes but despite the solid casting this just wasn't his movie. Millie is a really good actress and I'm glad there's finally some space between her and Stranger Things. I think leading a movie like this with this cast is a big step for her and I'm all for it. I'd give it a 6/10. It's not for me but enjoyable enough I'd probably recommend it.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "I enjoyed it a fair bit. Admittedly, I was a bit taken aback by the sudden sex scene between Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin's characters, seems like the sort of thing that would require a bit of set-up.

Almost lost me in the middle part but I\u2019m glad I stayed and finished it. \n\nI\u2019ve seen comments that the movie is sexist against men but I disagree. I think the movie handled that part better than most \u201cgirl power\u201d movies tbh. Both men and women were good and bad in the movie, as it is in real life. Lesser movies would have taken the easier route where all women are good and all men are bad. Although, I did not like that Mycroft was portrayed as a snob and an overall bad guy. As for Henry Cavill\u2019s Sherlock, I think they took a page out of Jonny Lee Miller\u2019s version rather than Benedict\u2019s. Not that I\u2019m complaining, I loved *Elementary*. \n\nWhat I appreciated most about it was that she was actually taught to fight by her mother, unlike in other movies where women are portrayed to be able to do anything just because they\u2019re women **coughs** Mulan (2020) **coughs**. I think *Enola Holmes\u2019* approach is more inspiring since you need to actually train and make an effort to do great things.\n\nAnyway, solid movie. Not my all-time favorite, but still a good watch.", "I liked the film, but some things stood out.\n\nMainly, how it started out with a whole \"oh my mom's missing wait gunpowder treason and plot\" scenario but turned into a \"save the Marquess, save the world\" situation. I get that the two were linked but I was hoping for some resolution for that beyond her mom showing up at the end.\n\nAlso a few moments that felt a bit too contrived solely for the purpose of moving the plot. Tewkesbury conveniently using flowers to bookmark where he was going? \n\nAnd pitting a sixteen year old girl against a armed and experienced assassin? Okay, but for a Holmes movie I'd have liked more outwitting and deduction, less extended hand to hand combat. \n\nDidn't like how Mycroft was a one-note villain in this one either.\n\nBut on the whole I'd say it was a fun and enjoyable film overall as long as I didn't think too deeply into it. Millie Bobby Brown in particular gave a great performance and I'd say she's destined for greater things after this.", "Pretty disappointing and predictable for a mystery movie. All the clue-finding seemed incredibly generic, almost like a kids' show: anagrams, numbers that actually represent letters, more anagrams...\n\nThe main character didn't even deduce that the grandma was the true mastermind; she just showed up in front of them. Also, how did she know they would return to the estate so that she'd know to send all the servants out?! Like, who the fuck would guess they'd make such a risky move instead of just hiding away in London again?\n\nIt was clearly using the Sherlock Holmes brand as a crutch. There is like nothing about this movie that required Sherlock Holmes be present. The story with the mother didn't even go anywhere.\n\nTLDR: The film was insultingly generic.", "Pros:\n\n* Millie Bobby Brown is really great in the lead role, especially for someone her age. A character who A) is that eccentric, and B) constantly makes asides to the audience could have easily become an annoying caricature, but she handled it well. \n\n* Henry Cavill's Sherlock is a refreshing change of pace from the sociopath we so often get. I'm sure by now everyone knows *why* we rarely see a softer side to Holmes, but I'm glad we got to see it here. If there's a sequel I hope he gets more screentime with MBB.\n\n* Enola's journey was pretty well-handled. Like her brothers, she's a little larger than life, but her struggles and successes are balanced enough so that she never feels helpless nor invincible. \n\nCons:\n\n* They really glanced over the fact that Eudora was a domestic terrorist, huh? \n\n* I really hated this version of Mycroft. Where was his intellect? Why was he skinny? He wouldn't have bugged me so much if he was anyone other than Mycroft. \n\nRandom Thoughts: \n\n* Reference is made to Sherlock being friendless, which implies to me  that he has yet to partner with Watson. And yet Sherlock seems to be something of a celebrity. But Sherlock was only ever famous because Watson writes about their adventures. Maybe there was a reference to Watson that I completely missed.\n\n* This could be a touchy subject, but casting an actor of African and South Asian heritage as Lestrade is just weird. If this movie had been set in modern times like Sherlock or Elementary then I wouldn't have thought twice about it. But in the 19^th century? He just stands out. Say what you will about Kenneth Branagh's Murder on the Orient Express, but at least they addressed Leslie Odom Jr.'s casting in the movie itself.\n\n* It seemed like a lot of the detection was mostly code breaking and puzzle solving. I would have liked more clues and logical reasoning. \n\nIt's totally inoffensive. MBB does a great job as the lead, it's an easy and breezy watch and there's a scene where Burn Gorman tries to drown a teenager. I think families and little kids will enjoy it and, at the end of the day, that's who this movie is for.", "I wish the mother and her reasoning for leaving had been more of the plot than the silly romance with the guy who\u2019s clearly not even half as intelligent as enola. I got bored of his story very quickly. Decent movie tho, would have liked all of it except the predictable romance if I had seen it as a young woman as well.", "I love how anyone who didn\u2019t like the movie is getting downvoted. It was fairly bland in my opinion. The acting was great but the story itself wasn\u2019t very engaging. I felt there wasn\u2019t enough \u201cdetective\u201d work for it to be attached to Sherlock Holmes. Also didn\u2019t care for the 4th wall breaks every 5 minutes. Like any other movie, watch for yourself and base your own opinion. I\u2019d say it was 5/10.", "I really enjoyed the movie, it is like a mix of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes and Dora the Explorer.

The result is something really energetic for me.", "I really enjoyed this. I thought Millie Bobby Brown was great, and even though I love Cumberbatch, I really enjoyed Henry Cavill's less 'asshole-y' take on Sherlock Holmes.\n\nOverall a really fun family movie, even though it did get surprisingly violent a couple times.", "This movie surprised me. I remember the movie trailer coming out, and all my excitement went away, but now that I\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s super fun.

A wholesome, coming of age, detective movie. I really liked the 4th wall break. I enjoyed it and I hope they make more movies especially with Sherlock.", "Is it just me or did this movie have some very bizarre tonal shifts?\n\nLike the moment she was being drowned by the assassin and then played dead, and then the camera held on her pale, drowned, eyes-opened  face for a few seconds before she winks at the audience in a return to quirky, fourth wall breaking form?", "I was incredibly emotionally invested in the pine cone. When she left the women\u2019s school and was being carried out by Teweksbury, I kept thinking \u201cok but I hope she took the pinecone with her\u201d. I\u2019m happy it had another cameo towards the end.", "Enola constantly looking at the camera was absolutely cringe. I cant even imagine why they would put that in the movie. \n\nEnola cries about having to go to boarding school (which she escapes by just climbing out a window anyway, wtf is that whole scene), but doesnt give a shit when she fucking murders someone...\n\nTake out her looking at the camera, take out all the fighting (especially unnecessary Ju Jitsu scene), because they are both nonsense, and this movie is at least 30 minutes shorter and a lot easier to watch. \n\nThis is a movie for teenagers that parents can sit through as well. They dont need fighting and murdering. Just a love affair and a smart young lady.", "Watched it last night, slept on it before posting, my first thoughts are... I really liked this movie. Nothing wrong with it? A lot real good with it and some great in it.", "Completely misses the point of the novels.  Self-reliance is a major theme . Her mother\\`s reminder \"*Enola*, *you will do quite well* on *your own*.\u201d  becomes her mantra/Credo. Apart from that Enola\\`s relationship with her mother is not that close. It felt very Americanized here.\n\nThe novels are feminist, but not in the pandering way of this movie. There is no love interest, no black female martial arts teacher,  Enola carries a dagger and is as  the name suggests alone most of the time. They removed all of the edges from the source material and the casting of Cavill and Claflin was a strange choice (adaptational attractiveness turned up to 11)", "The movie does not have a lot of depth or meaning..it lives and dies on MBB's performance and she did really well. The logic behind the two mysteries is a little weird, the mother arc has an unsatisfying end..but I found myself just enjoying MBB having fun in fun situations and playing a fun character with lines.\n\nA character like this, a know it all and proficient at most everything, staring in the camera, it would have been very easy to be unlikable in the wrong hands. But MBB is extremely likable in this..she's able to portray vulnerability and strength at the right times.", "The plot with the mum is just stupid. Enola isn't a moron, all she had to do was sit down and explain the situation, whatever it is, to her like a normal person would. \"Hey, I got some shit I need to do, if you need to contact me leave a message in the newspaper. Good luck kiddo, love you.\"   \n\n\nThe film really doesn't justify the mum's behaviour and thus the whole thing comes across as contrived and lazy.  \n\n\nAlso, this movie needed more Henry Cavill as Sherlock.", "Honestly, it was ok. Liked Brown and Cavil, but trough the message was super ham-fisted. Also it was weird how the mother left to be a terrorist and they never spoke about it in the movie.", "There was one missed opportunity in this movie, IMO it should have been a mini-series. \nHere\u2019s why:\nFirstly I really loved this movie. Brown (Enola) did an excellent job and I for one want to see more of her. \nThe ending though, lost steam. It felt like the writer had more to share but everything needed to be wrapped up. It would have been nice if the conclusion of the middle story arch didn\u2019t feel like the end of the movie. Thus: this could have been broken up into pieces to make an excellent mini-series. And, if successful, could have been a second season.", "Not my cup of tea, but it's a pretty good film. The cast was phenomenal especially Millie Brown who played Enola Holmes. She did a great job and I sympathize with her character throughout. The chemistry between characters was emotional and heartfelt Enola with her brother Sherlock, Enola with her mother, and Enola with that Tewksbury boy (kinda forgot his name). I think the themes in the film are pretty great: politics of women's rights, some quotes that stick with me \"the future is up to us, try to be excited not disappointed with new experiences.\" All the messages are real inspiring!\n\nNow I get that this film is pretty political with women especially during the 1890's but as a guy it gets a bit annoying and kind of sexist with \"all men suck\" message. The film likes to hammer away every chance they get. At one point in the film, an elderly lady straight up says \"men are so useless!\" and pushes the man through the door to get the door open.\n\nNot sure if the pacing/editing is too fast or I'm not as \"bright\" but the plot can get confusing. There were times when I'd be watching and rewind parts because I have no idea what just happened of what, why, or how?\n\nI'm big on action scenes, but the fight scenes were meh in this film to me. Sometimes there were way too many cuts and the moves were more flashy instead of practical: I believe Edith threw Enola with an O goshi but the excess cuts and angle made it difficult to see. Enola did some kind of throw on the bowler hat guy that looked like a pro wrestling move instead of a simple shoulder throw or ippon seoi nage.\n\nThere were also some inaccuracies with Japanese Jiujitsu in London of that time period. The film is set in 1884 and Ju Jitsu didn't arrive in England until around 1903. I was gonna say judo would have been closer with it being introduced in 1899. I'd say the best substitute martial art for that time period would be catch wrestling or boxing. Catch wrestling was invented in London out of all places in 1870, it couldn't have been more perfect! Boxing has been around since 1600's so absolutely historically accurate. Eh who cares though, no one will right?\n\nI'm nitpicking at this point but overall, it's a pretty good and interesting film. Not bad!", "This was better than I thought it'd ever be, surprisingly. I'll be the first to admit that lol. Fun watch, good performances from Millie and Henry. Now I want more of both in their own movies.\n\nEDIT: Oh how could I got get to mention that one speech by Susan Wokoma. Also, Cavill's Holmes feels like The Witcher playing character Sherlock Holmes. It's weird how both characters seem similar to me now.. \n\nEDIT: I think I'm high?\n\nEDIT: Omg and the story is pretty good too, and Sam and Louis are actually great too.", "Maybe I expected too much out of this film but I found *Enola Holmes* to be a fairly pedestrian young-adult mystery with its Victorian setting not adding much to the proceedings. Millie Bobby Brown was fine as the young a spunky Holmes' sister but I found Henry Cavill wasted in the part of Sherlock and the depiction of Mycroft, who is Sherlock's smarter brother, boarding on the offensive to anyone who has read Doyle's stories. I'm not sure how other fans of Arthur Conan Doyle's writing will take this but all I can say is *\"I hope the book this was based on was better\"* and as the movie hints at further adventure - being that the key mystery behind Enola's anarchist mother is never really addressed - I hope they get better screenwriters for further installments.\n\nNote: If you want to read a good female-centric Holmes story I suggest checking out *The Charlotte Holmes Series* which is a wonderful trilogy by Brittany Cavallaro.", "Mycroft Holmes was poorly casted.", "What was the reform bill about?? If it was about women's suffrage, why would the Grandmother be murdering her sons to prevent it??? Why didn't we get any kind of nuanced discussion or explanation about descisions made by the grown women in this movie? Why were the evil, patriarchy-enforcing characters (the grandma, the headmistress) both women? What were their motivations?? Whats up with the mom?!?! WHAT WAS THE REFORM BILL ABOUT????  This film felt like a fluffy girl power piece when it really should have had a stronger message.", "I know this sub is not a fan of dissenting opinion or anything less than adulating critique, but this was so bad I felt compelled to say something. I don\u2019t see how anyone except a ferret on a double espresso could appreciate the story or the editing of this picture.", "A very entertaining film, and I\u2019m not even a teenage girl.\n\nBiggest positive: how neatly the two stories/destinies meet and influence each other while still feeling natural. A lot of films that want to do this kind of plotting end up like children using a hammer to get the triangular piece to fit into the round hole.\n\nBiggest negative: \u201cimportant character gets shot and killed, everyone is very emotional but oh wait no they actually had a necklace/pocket watch/book/armor plate that protected them from the bullet\u201d is really an awful trope that needs to go away.", "This movie suffers a fate worse than being bad... it was boring.", "I really enjoyed the tone of this movie. Fun and clever for the most part, and I do enjoy a trip to 19th century London. \n\nThe whole aspect with the finishing school was odd. It felt like it was supposed to be a far worse place than it was portrayed. The headmistress as well. She hit Enola in the first scene with her, but seemed to immediately regret it (granted, she never apologized.) And once at the school, she did seem to care. And although the other girls laughed at Enola's lack of manners, none of them were mean to her.\n\nIt honestly felt like it should have been either \"nice veneer with abuse behind the scenes\" or \"really not as bad as Enola feared, and possibly even useful.\" The latter especially would have been interesting if it served as a precursor to her dressing as a lady. Learning fine etiquette and then using that knowledge in her disguises.\n\nBut instead, the school was just kind of...average and unremarkable.", "It had the women empowerment a bit too heavy handed for my liking, nothing against it but I felt like I was getting beaten over the head with it the whole movie. That being said the film seemed geared towards a younger audience and thus probably wasn't meant for my tastes regardless. Fine for what it is, but I've seen it done much better.", "Oh yeah, it was cool seeing Sam Claflin play the exact same character as Peaky Blinders Season 5, but with a tad less fascism.", "\\[SPOILER\\]\n\nFun, enjoyable, has good messages, but many of the ones framed around feminism is undermined by the fact that only two named men are not shown as some sort of villain with a lack of depth. Mycroft really got the short end of the shaft. The two that was not framed as villains were Sherlock and our boi Tewksbury, Tewksbury is okay, but for the most part he was the damsel in distress equivalent, and Sherlock, he was just scolded by women, and I more so just felt bad for him.  \n\n\nBefore you downvote me to hell, the film has great messages concerning feminism, honestly, I'd be giving the film a Delta if it was on r/changemyview, it made me think about the active enforcement of the system that serves you at the expense of others (Mycroft), and the passive complacency to the system (Sherlock). Yes, it was supposed to just be a fun film, but I really think humanizing Mycroft, would make the message more compelling, that the people reinforcing the patriarchy isn't just some mustache twirling caricature, but an actual person that could be your brother or father, who really does care. Maybe I'd have Mycroft express legitimate sadness or anger that his sister was unable to be raised well (in his world view).  \n\n\nIdk, it's definitely not as bad as I thought it was when it comes to shoving feminism down people's throats, I've probably just became oversensitive and jaded from saturation of feminism done wrong, and this film really got a bit too close to the line of \"men bad\", just not sure if it crossed it. I do like how they illustrate that corset (femininity) can be empowering when chosen, but painful when forced.", "Her mom\u2019s plot was silly. There was no reason for her to leave without saying goodbye. She had reason to leave, so her daughter would be safe. But not telling her daughter why only put Enola in more danger. The only good that did was to create a plot line for the movie.", "I thought it was kind of a mess of a movie, to be honest.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown was a bit too energetic for my tastes, at times almost bordering on manic, which kind of felt like an odd tonal mood for the main character in the story (who supposedly was facing some pretty traumatic abandonment issues). Elena Bonham Carter is, well, her. Which is to say I feel I\u2019ve seen this exact same performance of hers on a couple other movies. Henry Cavill was, as someone else put it, adequate. It was an actor playing Sherlock Holmes. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the dude, but I just couldn\u2019t buy the performance. Burn Gorman was just uninspiring as \u201cthe dragon\u201d. The rest of the cast was fine, nothing special, just fine for their intended roles.\n\nPlotwise, well\u2026 there\u2019s my beef. I think I\u2019m ready to move past \u201chere\u2019s another invincible, empowered woman taking on the world and steamrolling her way to success\u201d. I find it hard to relate to characters that are already up to the challenge they are supposed to face right from the get go (female OR male). Don\u2019t get me wrong, Enola faced some hardship in the movie, but for some reason the obstacles she faced seemed more like a moment for her to show off how well prepared she was from the start than a real moment of growth for the character. Finally pulling off the Jujitsu grasshopper move or whatever? Yeah, cool, glad you could.\n\nIs it a mystery movie? Is it a family movie? At times it tries to be too many things at once and ends up meandering quite a bit. Plot resolutions feel off. There are some pretty wild leaps of logic. And the ending feels more like a \u201cwell, those are our two hours, better wrap this up somehow\u201d, than a cathartic experience.\n\nI did like the set pieces and the photography. The music choices at some points seemed just weird. I did like the cutout montages in between scenes to accompany exposition.\n\nThere.", "Enola Holmes was a fun family film that echoed the struggles of women in early 20th century London in the style of a classic Sherlock Holmes film.\n\nI loved cast. Millie Bobby Brown is a marvel. I think she's going to do great things. This was a starkly different character from Eleven, and she was excellent. She's very personable, which makes the 4th wall breaks work generally well in this film. She inhibits this big personality and you can very easily see the spunk and tenacity she brings to Enola. \n\nI quite liked Henry Cavill as Sherlock. We didn't see much of him, but I'd be interested in a film where he actually plays the famed detective. Sam Claflin as Mycroft was alright. Mycroft is clearly not supposed to be a well liked character, and Claflin does a good job. He sort of does fit the mold of an early 20th century diplomat in London though. I really liked Helena Bonham Carter as Eudoria. I thought she brought this wonderful craziness to the character, but she could still emit this love for Enola when the film called for it. Overall, I'd say we got the perfect dose of each side character. The film clearly focuses on Enola, and it does it well.\n\nFourth wall breaking is a bit hit or miss in my opinion. As I stated early, MBB's charisma makes it generally work in this film. They establish early on that she thrives when she's on her own, so the wall breaks feel a bit like she's talking to herself. But the content of her wall breaks are so-so in my opinion. We open the film with \"3 things you should know about me\". It's a fun opening, but it doesn't really feel like 3 things we *need* to know about Enola. The third fact is that she can't really ride bikes, but that fact doesn't return to the film until the very last shot. The conclusion is a bit stiff as well, as most narrated conclusions are. \n\nWhat really brought me away from this movie were the puzzles. Generally, the puzzles were all solvable if you paid attention. But it felt like at least two thirds of the puzzles were just word scrambles. There is a decryption puzzle using a codex, but not much else. I will admit that solving the Tewksbury case is fun. All the pieces are given to us throughout the film. It's not an overly complicated puzzle, which doesn't quite make it as interesting as a puzzle we might see in the BBC or RDJ versions of Sherlock, but it is fun to see the breadcrumbs throughout the film come together.\n\nMaybe it's not my place to comment on this aspect as a man who has never and will never know the struggles of women in this or any other country or time, but the women's rights aspect of the film felt a bit simplified and on the nose. There wasn't very much nuance. I think it's always easy to paint gender discrimination as bad when it's as simple and universally agreed upon as \"women should or shouldn't vote\". It's much harder to discuss the intricacies that women deal with in modern society -- the right to make decisions on their own bodies, the right to earn the same paycheck as a man. The film also lacked any and all nuance on the struggles of women of color. If we're going to acknowledge women's rights in 20th century London, shouldn't we also acknowledge the struggles for black women? This is a children's movie, so perhaps this isn't the place for such nuances. But it is important for me to acknowledge where this film, which spends most of its time with the struggles of women, fails to fully capture the story.\n\nPerhaps my favorite aspect of the film was the way it was edited. The little animations and cuts were fantastic. When Enola is solving a puzzle, you can see words scramble and unscramble until she's found the answer. I particularly loved the animation depicting the corkscrew fighting move, as well as the old timey film slides detailing what phase of her plan she was on when she lost count. \n\nOverall, this is a family friendly, toned down, female driven film in the style of the Sherlock stories we've all come to love. The cast is fantastic, highlighted by a rising star in MBB. They bring a great energy to the screen. The puzzles are a bit simple, making it easy for kids, but they're depicted in a fun way. I'm not sure this is a movie I could see myself or my kids watching again and again, but it's two hours well spent.", "Great movie, hope there will be a sequel. But the malcolm in the middle style was sometimes a bit too much for me", "The cringe in this film was overwhelming. The distorted view of feminism by Americans in general (and by movie productions in particular) is making me hate more American films than usual. I know Americans are where the money is, and feminism is a hot topic that all teenagers love, but there is a limit that an average person can handle. I love Sherlock Holmes but at some point this movie turnes unpleasent to watch.", "I really liked it. The scenery was beautiful and having a Sherlock Holmes movie in which is not the main spotlight was refreshing for a change.\n\nHowever I wish the 4th wall was broken less often. It was fine at the beginning of the move for a rapid introduction, but clearly overused overall.", "This is a perfect example for what a 6/10 movie on imdb SHOULD look like. \n\nSlightly above average, decent performances - with exceptions. Good - but way too on-the-nose - message. Great set/costume design, except when it's pretty obviously subpar CG and a straight-forward plot, if you disregard the underdeveloped mothers intention and the passages were logic gets stretched (like when tf did he put the breastplate on?). \n\nFor the target audience (~12-14 year olds) this is probably quite great. For everyone else it is a fine movie. Best direct comparison I'd say would be the shitty Artemis Fowl movie (gifted protagonist, \"missing\" parent, discovers a plot that involves said parent) and in that regard the quality and heart of Enola Holmes is on a different plane of existence.\n\n6/10. Wouldn't watch again, but had some fun with it.", "For the sequel: \"Hi, my name is Enola, my mom's a terrorist and I killed my first man when I was sixteen.\"", "In general, I liked the movie. I liked Henry as Holmes. He is awkward with his sister, but shows obvious care. I like the little glimpses of his deductive skills. It's early in his career as a detective, so he is not as well known. Also, he isn't the main character.\nWhile he isn't the Holmes that we have come to expect, he is a reasonable alternative. The basic Holmes-esk personality traits are there. Honestly, I'm fine with his portrayal of Holmes. It fits the reality of this world.\n\nI thought that the relatively slow burn relationship between Enola and the boy was nice. It felt pretty natural. They had good chemistry together by the time that the film ended. It was good to see his slow reveal as more than a spoiled rich kid. I hope he is developed more. Maybe be her Watson.\n\nConsidering that Enola was trained to fight from an early age, I kinda expected her to do better. But that was against people not trying to kill her. Not to mention, an experienced assassin. So, I can understand why she didn't fare so well in those fights. \n\nI liked how she broke the 4th wall. It was done in a fun way. It didn't distract from the movie. Personally, I thought that it added to it.\n\nAs for her mom's story, eh. I could take it or leave it. It was the cause of the movie happening. It makes some sense, but I was expecting something more. It just didn't feel satisfying for an ending. It tied up ok. That said, the rest of the movie was great! I really enjoyed it, and hope they make more.", "Enjoyable watch, but nothing exceptional. I also thought it was weirdly violent (having a grown man fight and attempt to drown a kid, or trying to choke another). I have no problem with violence in films in general, in fact I love Tarantino movies and that should tell you something, but I found the adult on teen violence a little disturbing.", "A terrible attempt at a female empowerment movie, totally filled with loose ends that don't get tied up, and ends up falling back into the romantic trope of a teen flick. \n\nThe fourth wall breaking from Enola becomes obnoxious and in my opinion, is an attempt to distract the viewer with wit and conversation whilst being able to ignore the total lack of content in the film.\n\nWhat happened to Eudoria and her plot to bomb, something. What was she even planning to bomb, parliament?\n\nHow convenient that Enola used the Caesar cipher on exactly the right day, otherwise she would've gone to the royal hall at 5pm many days early.\n\nShe had no reason to go back and save Tewkesbury on the train, any normal person with a sense of self preservation would've left and allowed him to die.\n\nHow is it that Enola is 16 years old, but is consistently able to pass as 22, and at one point she even passes as a widow. \n\nThis film relies heavily on suspension of disbelief despite being a film that should be grounded in reality, and also requires you to ignore glaring issues, whilst trying to accept the female empowerment message despite falling into the same romance tropes.\n\nAll in all a 4/10 film, lots of big names in an attempt to save the terrible plot. Hats off to all the actors, although I think Brown went a little too far with the accent, despite being British herself.", "That was such a fun movie. Can anyone suggest me similar ones? The theme I enjoyed the most was an intelligent girl being underestimated and told to follow conservative societal norms. I was feeling vicariously enraged at Mycroft and absolutely loved how she handled those challenges.\n\nAlso, I like how she wasn't just automatically perfect or beating everyone. She had potential but made mistakes, failed, struggled and _then_ succeeded.\n\n\nAre there any other movies like these?", "I'm glad they didn't make Enola totally upstage Sherlock, she was a great character. Though I do think she's far too modern, she has the values of a modern day teenage girl, which I doubt entirely represents what 19th century feminists were like, but hey ho.", "Couldn\u2019t even finish it.

They gave out a lot of the trite \"You can do anything you want!\" type of messages, especially in her mother's advice, but then they also clearly showed that an empowered woman was *not* acceptable in that society and would be stymied, bound, and forced into submission. Even the climactic victory of getting a suffrage vote passed had to be done by proxy, via the Viscount. Empowerment takes more than just a can-do attitude, it requires real systematic change.

I mean, i get it, this is the type of thing that need to be talked about and criticize, but how about you create a powerful woman instead of telling me that she is one? I'm not complaining about the feminist theme, i just think it's made very poorly and cheap. Even my gf, who is a very passionate feminist, despise the movie and said this actually hurt the movement instead of helping it. What's up with this constant hate towards men?

Is not that feminism is bad teaching, no, don\u2019t get me wrong, is the message of the movie what being wrong, for me for reduced to \"as a girl/woman, you are independent, tough, emotionless and rude until you meet a good looking and rich guy\" this was the whole throw away for the main reason I guess a woman wrote the novel, which was teaching about feminism in the first place.

Plus, I hated the movie so far anyway -- there was an odd mix  of beautiful cinematography/lighting paired with really amateur  shot/framing choices and bland acting (the scene between Janelle Monae  and Kiersey Clemons was **so** poorly made). Some of the staging and blocking of scenes seemed so inhuman and weird.\n\nOnce  the reveal is made, it actually makes those scenes so much more stupid  somehow instead of the opposite of what it was trying to achieve.  Instead of thinking, \"that's why they were acting weird\" like they want  for us to think, I feel most people will feel like its cheap  storytelling instead, playing games and omitting VERY key details just  to sell the illusion ONLY for the sake of tricking the audience (and I  guess the confederates in the movie too, but that still doesn't make a  decent excuse for the slaves to act that way IN PRIVATE). I'm so glad I  turned it off early because the result was nowhere near as satisfying as  it should be.\n\nI think  conceptually the movie COULD work, but they went about executing it all  wrong. If the first 10 minutes was slavery, and then it shifted to her  regular life only for her to get kidnapped, with the rest of the movie  about her getting away, it would've made less things obtuse for the sake  of being mysterious. We know the horrors of slavery, we didn't need to  see every bit of detail that makes it horrific, or even get to know all  the characters yet.\n\nHonestly, if  they just had those opening credits then cut to her waking up in modern  day, I probably would've been all for it -- in fact, I'd love to see a  fan edit, it honestly could be way better. We wouldn't have to sit there  and question EVERY LITTLE STEP a character makes -- like literally, her  trying to step on boards of wood that don't creak just seemed weird to  me IN A HOUSE WITH CLEAR OPEN WINDOWS. Instead, we could just go for the  ride and root for our character.

We get it, they\u2019re on a racist plantation.

She got a whole ass monologue about how to properly pick up a woman that amounted to nothing. The writers wanted her to seem confident and sassy, but the shitty dialogue just across annoying and rude. Sidibe deserves better.\n\nVeronica is a popular celebrity and is being held just outside of a civil war museum, how the hell were these people pulling this off?? The film doesn\u2019t really acknowledge the horrific stuff that happens to her, with her just galloping away on a horse and suddenly ending, seeing no consequences to her trauma.\n\nUgh it just all makes me so annoyed.

Yup, they are right.\n\nIt didn't seem to have a story to tell, just a big *twist* to shock us all. I mean, what was the point of that movie?! \"Super evil white racists are super evil and racist. Oh, and slavery is horrifying\"? I mean... hm... duh?\n\nThe villains were so one-dimensionally vile, it looked like cruelty for the sake of it. \"Trauma porn\" is the right choice of words. And after the twist was revealed, they straight up looked like cartoon villains. Why exactly were these people so obsessed with reenacting the Antebellum era in its worst possible way? Fetishism? Fear of the white race to be extinct? Did they only target black scholars or could it also be random black people? How did that work? Explain it to me! And how the hell was that huge reenactment part even possible?! Hundreds of black people randomly disappeared for months and nobody noticed?

We had 40 minutes of slavery horror and then abruptly got like 30 minutes of Veronica's regular life, and *then* the twist (which was lame since, again, it makes no sense).\n\nI also wish that the movie focused more on how all of this took a toll on Veronica's mental health. She was kidnapped and had no idea where she was, taken away from her loving husband and daughter, didn't know if she'd ever see them again, beaten up and branded into submission, raped every night, saw multiple people die.

I felt betrayed. \n\nThe cinematography and acting definitely clashed. There were some beautiful scenes and a lot of hot mess scenes( a lot of the scenes dragged too damn long). Janelle was great but some of the actors were cringe. It felt like they got some actors who just graduated from acting school or some shit.\n\nI also thought this was by Jordan Peele. When it got to the twist, I realized that this wasn\u2019t him cuz he wouldn\u2019t have done it that sloppy. \n\nEhh it was ok but doubt I\u2019m gonna watch it again", "Terrible movie. \n\nThey had a real chance to explore some kind of mind bending storyline, but instead they gave us the most basic \u201ctwist\u201d you could possibly imagine. I thought when she woke up in the \u201cmodern\u201d world we were going to find out she was tormented in her dreams with this hellish slave world. Then there was going to be some twist about it becoming reality, starting with finding out the people in these \u201cdreams\u201d were real life characters. Almost as if the dreams were an allegory of reality. The little girl in the elevator almost gave the whole thing a supernatural feel, like there was going to be an even bigger twist. \n\nBut nope. Imagine the most basic possible plot twist, and that\u2019s it. You guessed it. Nothing deep, mind-bending, or creative about it. A civil war reenactment park that has a secret slave plantation? The people there are just kidnapped and brought in, then told to be quiet to lessen the chances of anyone ever finding out? Wow. Very creative. I\u2019m glad it was that and not something better... \n\nI\u2019d give this movie like a 5/10 on the acting alone, but I honestly can\u2019t even give it that. They had so much potential to make a great movie, one with a concept and twist that would put it as one of the best in recent memory, and they did absolutely nothing with it instead. That\u2019s enough to bump it down to a 4. And then, in an already relatively short film, they spent wayyy too long with meaningless dialogue between minor characters. If that were part of a buildup into some twist about the whole \u201cdreams are an allegory for reality\u201d idea, then it would\u2019ve been great. But in the context of what the movie actually is, it\u2019s a waste of time.

Very let down by this movie.", "Wow. Very disappointed. Could have really had something there with a proper script. For a film subject laden with such heavy themes, they somehow managed not to capitalize on any of them. Shame. Could have really had an amazing film here had they made better creative choices.", "So weird to see Mr. Sikowitz from Victorious play such a vile racist", "The first 35 minutes were incredible.  After that this movie was pure disappoinment.  The twist wasn't even a twist because in the context of the real world it doesn't make sense.  Kidnapping people and forcing them into slavery in a Civil War reenactment park that apparently gets no customers to even walk around and question it.  Not to mention this is not a positive portrayal in terms of taking the subject matter seriously.  They took the most horrific real world horror ever and made a joke of it.\n\nThe cut to the life before being kidnapped also was abrupt and out of no where.  Frankly the way the movie was paced is awful.  If it started with her regular life and then we got the cartoonish kidnapping, it'd at least not spit in the face of the audience who thought something supernatural or science fiction was going on.  This was a bad M Night twist because it subverted expectations no one wanted subverted.  Also what was up with that weird ghost girl in the elevator if it's nothing supernatural going on.  Also what was the theme of the movie.  What was I learning other then that racist white folks are racist and white.  In fact I'd think that this movie is offensive to racist white folks because even they would be like \" Hey that's too much work and also structurally unfeasible.\"\n\nNot all was bad because Janelle Monae gave an incredible performance.  They basically wasted an Oscar worthy performance in one of the worst movies of the year.  This movie also looks incredible and has a marvelous soundtrack.  The score is also impeccable.\n\nI would give this a 4 out of 10.", "Anyone else notice that the scene where she\u2019s watching herself debate that guy on TV, under his name it says \u201ceugenics expert.\u201d Such lazy writing.", "All I feel is disappointment. The last 5 minutes came and I was so confused. I honestly thought there\u2019d be more. \n\nAll the advertising tying it to Kindred and the \u201cget out\u201d producers for nothing. I feel like it did a disservice tying to kindred for both the book and this movie.", "One thing that keeps bothering me was who Julia was before she was kidnapped? We get that Veronica (Eden) and Eli (the Professor) are public figures in their fields of work, thus making them targets of Senator Denton and his followers. But the only thing we learn about Julia is that she's pregnant and lives in North Carolina! So why did we not get at least a glimpse at why she was chosen? She seemed like a strong character at first, but we didn't get an understanding of who she was!!!!", "Let me start with the positives: Good acting, good cinematography. The concept isn\u2019t bad, but it was executed poorly.\n\nThe negatives, there are quite a few.\n\nI sort of ruined the twist for myself before even watching the movie. From the trailer I was able to guess that it was modern times and people were trapped there. \n\nThe trailer also showed the airplane glitching in the sky so I assumed it was some sort if futuristic forcefield, when it reality, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThere were scenes in this movie that were incredibly frustrating and really hurt the movie. The characters would act really really dumb at times or do things that don\u2019t make sense.\n\nA) Veronica getting in the wrong Uber, being called about how she\u2019s in the wrong uber and then not even worrying about it.\n\nB) The little girl in the elevator. Why was she even there? Was it just to be creepy? It seemed like a pointless scene other than to say \u201cOoooo creepy\u201d. It looked like the movie was trying to be the Shining. \n\nC) Veronica murdering the general and then taking the phone only to comically fumble the phone and stand out in the bright light. This lady has a PhD, she should be smarter than this, especially if she\u2019s been planning for it fir however long.\n\nD) Not showing the guys face at the bar.\n\nThese were pretty glaring errors in the writing that stuck with me and these scenes really took away from the quality of the movie.\n\nNow, going on to the characters.\n\nVeronica was a good character, a little one dimensional at times, but still decent. Every other character around her was poorly written, except maybe her husband. The actress from Precious\u2019 character I couldn\u2019t tell if she was being an asshole or if she was supposed to represent a strong person. She went after the hostess (who doesn\u2019t even choose the table on the reservation, that would have been the concierge from the hotel), she cut off the asian woman speaking to Veronica at the conference, and she was kind of a dick to the guy that bought her a drink. I just don\u2019t understand the purpose of this character. When you make a movie that is meant to send a message (and this movie sends it heavy handed) usually the characters represent something- this character represented an asshole.\n\nThe professor that died at the plantation and Veronica was extremely upset at his death, why did the writers not expand on this character and make me care about his death. \n\nOr how about the soldier Daniel, why was he here, what were his motivations? I want to know these things and they aren\u2019t touched on. Veronica was the only character you cared about and everyone else was one dimensional and paper thin or hateable. The movie could not create complex characters.\n\nLooking at the villains, they were comically racist evil people. Almost caricatures. They had no motivation other than being racist and evil. And the woman plantation owner I laughed at because her character was so ridiculous. Why did she go to Veronica\u2019s hotel room and just mess with stuff? Why did she take her lipstick? Why did flip her do not disturb sign? Was it just to minorly inconvenience her? And why did Veronica ignore all the shit being moved around?\n\nThen you look at the general, soldiers and senator. Why were they there? Why were the okay with treating these people poorly? Are people that do civil war reenactments super racist? What were their motivations other than \u201cI hate black people\u201d? What were the logistics of this and what was the purpose?\n\nIf you\u2019re making a movie to be a commentary, your message needs to be much better than this and needs to ask the \u201cWhy\u201d.  Just so, so shallow. \n\nMaybe the movie needed another 45 minutes to get these details straight. \n\nThe movie just didn\u2019t spend its time wisely.  I gave it a 5/10, at most it deserves a 6. It was a failing grade.", "I feel I don't like this movie for a different reason than the other comments I read. I don't really need a movie to have a meaning, I just need it to have a story that intrigues and entertains me. I actually thought the story was decent, some shots are absolutely incredible, but what ruined it for me was the acting. I feel it had a similar problem to Doctor Sleep, where they have these incredibly cheesy villainous characters. They speak like a cartoon villain and it just takes me completely out of the movie. \n\nAlso, some of the dialogue was just straight up awkward and felt incredibly forced. A few scenes that stuck out to me as extra terrible were when the little girl was in the elevator, the last horse scene where the cheesy villain is explaining everything while trying to shoot the main character, and when the guy delivers the flowers. I'm sure there are others but this changed the tone for the movie to me. It went from a series thriller/horror to some sort of twilight-esque film.  \n\nI really hope we start seeing some more well done horror films. Definitely is my favorite genre and they are becoming incredibly rare to find.", "I thought the beginning went on for way too long. I get that they wanted to show all the horrors of slavery, but as some other people here pointed out - I almost wish the film would\u2019ve been told in a linear format so that we could\u2019ve REALLY felt that payoff at the end with her getting revenge. By the time our brains are processing everything, the movie is over. \n\nThat being said...unpopular opinion, but I felt the twist halfway through was pretty awesome. (Well, not awesome. But you get what I mean) \n\nI kept reading about there being a twist and I was just so bored after the first gratuitous 40 minutes. (I think the 5 second thrusting rape scene could\u2019ve been cut. Disturbed me as it was clearly meant to, but it was a trigger and I was not expecting the movie to go there) \n\nBut I was hating on the movie for being confusing and just getting annoyed at everything. The little girl in the elevator being all mysterious and Veronica\u2019s unnecessarily bitchy friend. \n\nHowever, when it switched back to the \u201cother timeline\u201d and the cell phone was introduced, my jaw legitimately dropped. I was trying so hard to think of what the \u201ctwist\u201d was that my brain totally was not expecting it to be something so simple, yet horrifying. \n\nAlso, haven\u2019t seen anyone compare this to The Hunt yet. But I feel this is kinda the \u201cracism\u201d version of the \u201cpolitical\u201d The Hunt. Would make for a good double feature actually.", "Holy shit what did I just watch... that was worse than bad", "What was the sound that they all heard coming from the forest that made them all look at and stop working?", "Went back on Facebook and I guessed the twist on January 23rd at 7:36pm while I was about to watch The Turning. And that was probably my first time seeing that trailer.\n\n>!\u201dIs the Antebellum movie like WestWorld, but it's a plantation theme park?\u201d!<", "Not gonna lie, they had me in the first half. LOL I thought the movie was about some demonic spirit tormenting her and taking her back to the days of slavery. The twist ending shocked me though! Never would have guessed she was on a reenactment farm. Yeah I see that Rotten score but I still enjoyed it.", "I was expected a Jordan Peele horror film with a slavery backstory. \n\nIt is not a horror movie. It is a thriller drama if anything.\n\nWhat I got was greatly acted and filmed movie with a hole ridden story. They could've cut at least half of the movie and expanded on the end. The last 30 minutes of the movie were the best parts.\n\nYou never even learn why all this is really going on or for how long and who is involved besides a senator. I mean there's explosions and gunfire and no-one is alerting anyone about all that? Why is there cell service in the cabin but nowhere else? Is there a wireless router with no telephone or electrical wires anywhere?\n\nThe makers of this clearly tried to make you think that Jordan Peele was a part of this project and it really seems like they are just trying to capitalize on the present day racial injustice issues.\n\nAll in all the movie looks great and was acted well but uses some really shady and shitty marketing tactics.", "I cant be alone in thinking Precious character was unbearable. As a \"horror\" movie i really wished she'd be the obnoxious friend that dies, but not only does she never get comeuppance, i think the movie wanted me to like her.\n\nShe was rude and demeaning to every service worker, and am i supposed to believe out of the three women at the dinner table, that gentlemen caller wanted Precious?", "This was one of the movies I was looking forward to seeing this year after seeing its first trailer and I was so utterly disappointed. I will say some of the cinematography was fantastic, like the opening tracking shot and the final shot of her racing through the battle, but everything else was just hollow. While Get Out worked because it used subtlety and subversion to get its point across while also being scary, this was like a wrecking ball hitting you over the head with each characters personalities, which all basically amounted to Twitter buzzwords  and platitudes. Janelle Monae's speech at the conference and her Skype call with Jenna Malone were especially cringe-worthy, along with every time Monae's assistant spoke. \n\nIt didn't help that you could figure out the twist 25 minutes into the film, especially considering that trailers were playing this up as a more horror version of Kindred or something taking place inside Monae's broken mind. I now wish I had waited a week before renting this as I probably wouldn't have after seeing this movie do all three red flags for a trailer of a bad movie: showing reviews from no name review sites where the source is in size 2 font on screen, showing multiple quotes from the same positive review because it's the only one the movie got, and then showing reviews from random Blue Checkmarks on Twitter.", "I feel like the concept behind this movie could have made a really good thriller or horror movie, but the execution was awful. Get rid of the slave torture porn, add an actual explanation... Show how evil the villains are. The villains in this one were dumb as hell. And make it like.... A cult or something not something where people come and go all day and never question anything. That doesn't make any sense at all.", "I am having a hard time justifying $20 to RENT a movie.", "I\u2019m sick of being fed a plot twist. Just put the movie in order and stop trying to trick me. I\u2019m going to go into premiere and reorder the acts so I can actually get a good sense of the movie.", "I actually enjoyed the movie and the plot, there are two things I would have changed that would have made me a bit more emotionally invested in the characters. \n\nThe first, I would have made Dawn and the \"Julia\" character the same person. They still could have kept the mystery of how \"Julia\" knew \"Edan\" and the six week jump would have been enough time to target Dawn. \n\nSecond, I would have made \"Him\" and the man Veronica debates the same character. It would have given a reason as to why \"Him\" was so obsessed with Veronica.", "I\u2019m a lil rattled that this movie wasn\u2019t as well regarded as I expected. I knew nothing about it but discovered it when I listened to like 20 minutes of Janelle\u2019s interview with Marc Maron. All she said was that it\u2019s a thriller about an author living. Hours later, my girlfriend and I went into it blind and holy shit. \n\nThe first 40 minutes were real tough. I had to apologize because I thought I got her movies mixed up lol because this was clearly not the right movie. But the big twist hit me so hard. It gave me chills. The movie didn\u2019t really let up and I had no idea where it was going, especially with her comments about ancestors visiting in dreams. \n\nThe scene compositions were stunning. Contrasts were incredible. Even something simple like her and her daughter in the kitchen were very appealing to look at. The camera panning out from the shed with the Professor in it left me feeling queasy. Amazing shots. \n\nThe use of sounds were equally amazing. The silent intro which is broken by the footsteps was so fitting for the tone. The opening song too was hella intense and epic. And the fact that they tease it so subtly throughout the film only to bring it back during her retaliation...bruh. When Professor calls lieutenant dickhead a \u201ccracka\u201d, the sound cuts out so beautifully for that half second. \n\nI was genuinely astonished that this film got a 5.5 on IMDb and 28 on rotten tomatoes. Like what!!!!!????? No way that this movie was worse than fucking Don\u2019t Mess with the Zohan. I thought it was very well done, unique, and captivating. I could definitely see it being up for awards. Am I missing something?", "As a non American, when it comes to \"racially motivated movies\"...\n\n*Get Out* was heavy handed, but it was fun to watch.\n\nThis one is as subtle and graceful as an elephant in a porcelain shop. \n\nAmerican friends, face your race problems and sort them out, please.", "I didn't understand Gabourey Sidibe's character.  I thought she was supposed to represent what happens to people who are used to unmitigated power and become horrible because of it.  When she was bitchy to the hostess and told her, \"Not that table,\" I wasn't sure if it was written to show how strong Black women have become when they've achieved a lot (versus the enslavement in the earlier scenes) because it comes off like her character is nasty.  I really think she was cast just to give a role to someone who was once told she'd never work again after \"Precious\" (by Howard Stern) but she comes off like a deeply insecure person trying to do her impression of someone confident.  It might have misconstrued the point.  And when someone (faceless) comes over and declares his undying admiration of her, I thought he was part of some nefarious plot; somehow we're supposed to believe he was sincere and Gabourey was the one who caught his eye at the table.  Was I alone?  I think she was miscast and the material lost effectiveness because of it.  (Not that it was very solid anyway.)", "This was like The Village meets Hostel and that's not a good thing. \n\nWhile I went into this movie mostly blind, I had only seen a brief ad on YouTube which made it out to be a horror movie and while horrific things were done in this movie it still doesn't fall into the horror genre. I simply can't recommend this one.", "I almost didn\u2019t watch this because of bad critic reviews and hyperboles of \u201cworst movie of 2020,\u201d but I am glad I did. \n\nSure, there are staggering discrepancies in the cinematography; beautiful shots in the beginning juxtaposed with the laughable horse-jump chase scene. But overall it was a very well acted, had a great score, and I never lost interest. \n\nYes, the twist was handed to you in the trailer (I didn\u2019t see until after the movie, which helped), and perhaps the marketing team did this movie a disservice with that. But I do not think the movie itself should bear the cost of that, particularly when the movie is solid on its own. Good - not great - 7 or a low 8 out of 10.", "WTF was with the Aliens on the news crawl in the beginning and in the girls drawing? What did aliens have to do with anything?!? They were hinting so much at it!", "I watched it on Friday and was very entertained. I didn't go into it with much information, having watched the trailer only once. A friend of mine informed me he was surprised I liked it and referenced the low RT score. Then I came on here and am pretty surprised (but not really given the state of divisiveness in the U.S.) at how divided people are on this film. \n\nI see all these comments about the writing was shit and lazy. Pretty harsh, but hey, we've all got opinions, might as well use them. It's interesting how my judgement began to get a little clouded by the negativity surrounding this film. So, I watched it again last night with a more critical eye (rented it for 48 hours). Still enjoyed it. A lot. \n\nI don't really want to speculate on why some people are resorting to clich\u00e9 reasons about why they didn't like it vs. just saying why the really didn't like it, but, hey, some people feel a bit more empowered these days than others... I digress.\n\nSo, watching it again, I did notice some really interesting subtleties I didn't fully explore the first pass. The way they were picking cotton (which was slow and it looked like the cotton was just placed on the plants (for the most part) - I'm thinking this was exactly what the filmmakers wanted us to see. I was a total farce, so, yeah, we're going to make them pick cotton, but not really... and then, they were burning it, instead of prepping it for sale.\n\nKnowing the outcome also made some awkward things make a little more sense, like Amara's nose ring, or Julia's reaction to Eden's supposed weakness (when in the real world, she was the strong, assertive, Veronica). \n\nI like that it wasn't some far fetched, alternate universe story... this is what made it so scary. People get took all the time. It also seemed that this might have been a prototype to something bigger in the works with this \"organization\". \n\nSo many expectations seemed to be put on this film by so many people, guess I was just fortunate to not have them going in and it was great to watch. Visually, the cinematagraphy was fantastic and the performances (especially Janelle Mon\u00e1e carrying her first film) were great.", "Was really interested in the teaser but yeah no. \n\nAlso the reveal of the sign almost made me laugh, like it's this huge underground basically illegal Westworld where humans are being kept in real captivity and the sign is just like 'Apple Pay accepted here!'", "anyone know what the symbolism of the butterfly meant? it was Veronica\u2019s home screen and also tattooed on \u201cJulia\u2019s\u201d ankle. \n\nI was also a little confused about why the lady left her hair and messed up Veronica\u2019s room? little plotholes here n there.", "I found this movie hard to watch with what is going on in US.", "I guess I'm in the minority that liked this.

If any of them died in a different ocasion, all the rest would be alive.\n\nThe day his father executed his revenge against the poachers was the first step into creating God's avenging device: Arvin. This God even made sure to kill all the most important people in his live, his mom, dad, sister and dog, so he could get accustomed to death.\n\nNow let's look at the weapon. After the movie ends I truly believed that really was the gun that killed Hitler, and it was imbued with the power to kill evil because of that. The movie made a point to estabilish a relationship between Satan and Hitler and that same gun managed not only to kill all the baddies but  kept Arvin almost magically safe while doing it. After everyone who needed to die has gone, he buries it and literaly finds peace, in form of a Kombi sign with a jesus-like guy driving the car.\n\nCompleting the religious theme, the movie despicts a lot of terrible actions commited by man of faith in name of God. His father kills his dog as a sacrifice, Roy kills his wife naively thinking he would bring her back and God was testing him, the preacher uses religion to abuse his sister and even Carl relates his killings with religion, how he connects with God.\nWhat sick God would let His followers do that?\n\nExcept it wasn't God\n\nIt was the Devil all the time", "Tom Holland was perfect for this role. It really feels like he has an innocence in him that is corrupted in the story, and that maybe his character can get back to it after. I think it might have been more satisfying in the moment to have a different actor beat someone with a pipe. But I think with only the text of the story, we miss a lot of what Holland brought to it.", "Man, I loved Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s accent I think he was the only one who could actually pull off that southern accent nicely.", "Holland is a star with real staying power", "Did anyone else notice how Robert Pattinson\u2019s character threw the Bible at Arvin? Thought it was symbolizing how the preacher tries using the Bible to \u201csave himself\u201d/defend himself much like he/others clam the Bible is salvation. Also shows his priorities of not possibly not caring about the text itself by discarding it so fast.", "So. Can we place a real life person as a guy who picks up Arvin at the end of the film?\n\nGot some weird Charles Manson vibes but doesn't add up.", "I overall enjoyed this movie but I thought the story was too ambitious for the runtime.  There are at least 4 major predators in this film (The Sheriff, the serial killer couple, the spider preacher (Dudley), and Robert Pattinson) and none of them felt like they got the time they deserved.  I think this would have been better as a 6 part series or something so there was time to explore the characters more.  A few things that bothered me:  \n1. the narrator explains that Carl (male serial killer) kills to feel closer to god (which in and of itself is weak that the narrator has to explain it rather than the explanation coming naturally through Carl), but why does Sandy participate?  She is clearly unsure about it after they've already killed a dozen or so people; what did she ever get out of it?  It is never established that she likes killing, or she hates sinners or anything.  She has no motivation at all.\n\n2. The Sheriff was a completely flat character and his side plot with Leroy was a big whiff. Leroy has two scenes: he is established as a powerful criminal with leverage over the Sheriff; the Sheriff fears him and pathetically takes money that Leroy has spat on.  Then in his second scene the Sheriff kills him and Bobo, and that's the end of that.  Leroy is never relevant again and the Sheriff never faces any consequences for the murder, it's never even brought up.  \n\n\n3. The film is so committed to its bleak outlook that I felt I was able to guess what would happen next not based on what character motivations or storytelling cues, but by thinking of the most awful way events could play out. >!Lenora committing suicide felt particularly egregious to me - she is the most saintlike, god fearing, and timid character in the movie, but she somehow musters the will to hang herself.  This never made sense to me but I guessed that it would happen because it was the most horrible way her arc with the preacher could end.  But then the film has to twist the knife even more by having the narrator explain at the very last moment that she actually decided NOT to do it but then she slipped and died anyways.  !<Its not that I think any of the horrible things in the movie are unrealistic, just that the sheer volume of awfulness felt contrived by the end.  >!We got a dog crucifixion, a man stab his wife in the neck just because he is crazy, a young girl commit suicide because of a predatory preacher, serial killers who castigate and torture their victims, and a corrupt cop who covers for said serial killers.!<  Any one of those is enough subject for a full film.  If the predators in this film were more fleshed out and we understood their motivations more, I think it would have been easier to buy into their misdeeds.  But because we don't get that time, it felt like a clown car of two dimensional villains doing horrible things without much explanation.  \n\n\nWhy is it always easier to criticize than to praise?  Overall I still liked the film.  There are lot of great details that I missed that others are pointing out in this thread.  I thought the acting was good all around, but my favorite performance was the spider preacher!  I saw him and thought \"That's Dudley!\" but I immediately bought into his character.  He really nailed it.", "DELUSSSSIONNSSS", "Okay. Just finished watching this film. Initially when I looked at the cast it was Marvel meeting Harry Potter and it really intrigued me. Also what intrigued me is most of the major roles were played by British, Swedish, Romanian and Australian actors in a film centered in and around Ohio in perhaps the most \"American\" time period, the 50s and 60s.\n\nAnd their performances blew me off. Tom Holland. Boy this kid can really act. What a performance. Just nailed those expressions. The range of emotions his eyes conveyed with subtle changes in his demeanor was something actors with over 20 years of experience would have been proud of. Even the kid playing him aged 9 was top notch. That struggle with his father when the dog was killed was perhaps the scene of the movie.\n\nPattinson doing a sleazy role was refreshing. Did a commendable job too. But next to Holland, I found Bill Skarsgard's performance to be the best. In a very limited time frame he just nailed it. His struggle with PTSD, faith and the world in general was brilliantly portrayed.\n\nLastly I want to mention Harry Melling (Dudley Dursely of all people) as Roy Lafferty. His name might get lost among these glamorous stars but it left a lasting impression on me. I just can't wait to see more of his work.", "Towards the end, there's a really nice parallel drawn between Arwin and the Sheriff. Both tried to get revenge for their sisters who were trapped in a desperate situation by evil men who took advantage of them.", "Did anyone else notice that it looks like Sebastian Stan is wearing a mouthpiece in the movie, like Marlon Brando in the Godfather??", "Lenora's realization that her & her baby would still be ok right before she commits suicide reminded me of how suicide survivors say that they realized that they would be ok even if they don't commit suicide. :'(", "I felt really bad for grandma when rob pat didn\u2019t like her food :(", "Man this was brilliant. Been along time for a Netflix movie to hit like that for me.  Holland and Pattinson were just amazing.  Cast is just so deep and solid throughout. Movie is over 2 hours and feel like I could have been happy if it lasted another two just to make the story more in depth.  I really may just watch it again because of how much I liked it.  The setting and time is mesmerizing and the narrator.  I dunno this was a great watch.", "Robert pattinson - my God, this man is a fucking chameleon.\n\nStory was interesting but pacing could have been better and some of the arcs could have been better fleshed out like the couple I wish we saw more of them beyond the killings. That same goes for Sebastian Stan's role. He really would have benefited from some more story time. However, they really did manage to weave the themes of religion, delusions, lust and manipulation into the different arcs.", "If Willard had married Helen like his mama had promised God, none of the horrible things in the movie would've happened: (SPOILERS) >!Willard wouldn't have lost his wife to cancer, making him snap and traumatizing Arvin. Helen wouldn't have been murdered by her husband, who wouldn't have been murdered on the road by Carl and Sandy on the way back to see Lenora. Lenora wouldn't have been an orphan who grew up to be molested by the preacher. Arvin wouldn't have murdered the preacher, leading him to murder Carl, Sandy, and Bodecker!<", "I read the book a few weeks ago, so the story was fresh in my mind.\n\nI very much enjoyed the book. It was dark, depressing, and down right gut wrenching. I am a bit upset that Roys storyline was cut and carl/sandy's line was so thin. The narrator had to fill in so many gaps, which made it kind of awkward. Other than that, I think this was a great adaptation.\n\nThey did Jake fucking dirty tho.", "Damn, really enjoyed this movie a lot. Big fan of Tom Holland now", "Fuck the reviews guys this is a really good movie. Super slow in the first half but then all the events kind of collide. 8/10", "This was such an odd movie. Like I don\u2019t even know if I enjoyed it, it was just a thing I experienced. I had zero expectations going in. All I knew was Tom Holland and Sebastian Stan were in it. No knowledge of the story at all. Great performances from everyone though. \n\nI really have nothing bad to say about it, but I don\u2019t know what to say.", "The scene where he's just shot Lee (the cop), and he explains himself for having shot Lee's sister. In that moment, I feel like he thought Lee had the same blood-thirsty protectivness that Arvin himself had. That terrible need to make right the wrongs done to his loved ones. Arvin tells Lee what he already knows, that his sister and her husband were serial killers trying to kill him. In that moment, Arvin essentially gives Lee's words back to him. Some people were born just so they could be buried.", "I feel like I watched a different movie than everyone else because I honestly loved this movie. It was brilliant. The scene of Holland and Pattinson in the church was so fucking tense and well acted. This might be my top film of the year (I know, I know...not mich competition. But still, there have been some great films coming out of Netflix this year.)", "Am I the only one that thought the hippie at the end was going to kill Arvin? Like I thought the movie would end up with all the main characters dead lol. Anyway the movie was not exactly what I was expecting but it was better than okay.", "I was actually really hoping Tom Holland would force RPat on a drive and decide not to kill him, then make him get out on the side of the road and leave him there to walk, where he would be picked up by the couple.", "\"Some people are born just to be buried.\" I found this movie deeply disturbing and I would rate it a 10/10. Someone else compared it to mad max for the level of violence, but I do believe this movie is on par more with reality. Is violence ever truly justified? For Tom holland's character it absolutely is without a doubt.", "Really liked that movie.  A couple of things I'm wondering were intentional or not though, maybe someone that read the book could clarify?\n\n1. ARVN was the name of the south vietnamese forces which are in the war he may be heading to\n2. Charles manson drove a volkvagon bus and grew up in Cincinnati, where he was headed at the end of the movie,  wondering if that was intentional to further signify that the devil is with us all the time.\n\nEdit:  I see lots of others noticed the manson thing too in the comments, cool beans.  I might be reading too much into it, but I think by his name he will go to Vietnam and fight alongside the ARVN.  Or his other option was going with love revolution, but manson is there to remind us that no matter where he goes, evil is inherent.", "Am I the only one who thought this movie was a home run? I loved every minute of it.", "I liked it, but the only part that didn't fit for me was the sheriff's role (Sebastian Stan). \n\nI actually think it would have been better if the sheriff was actually a \"good\" guy. Then when the standoff with Holland's character occurs, there is much more tension between who will live or die.", "Absolutely loved this, amazing blend of southern gothic and religious horror. \n\nAnyone else think that Arvin realizing he was shot with blanks turned him briefly into a god fearing man? Lol", "Am I the only one who thinks this is One Hundred Years of Solitude minus the magical realism? For others it may be an odd film but I can\u2019t help but be fascinated by the parallels and recurring themes in the film. Some people may be overwhelmed by the number of characters jumbled in those 2 hours or so but they all make sense. \n\nLet me list down all the parallels and details I remember from the film which you may have missed: \n- Arvin following his dad Willard in terms of revenge \n- Willard saw a marine crucified at the start of the film, and the dog he crucified was the last thing he saw. \n- The 2 couples who met at the diner (Sandy and Carl, Charlotte and Willard) \n- The 2 orphans (Arvin and Lenora) in the same house; both were bullied at some point \n- Helen and Lenora both falling for a pastor \n- Both holy men are sinners and ended up dead (Preston and Roy) \n- Lee saw young Arvin with his dead father, and this same cop sought Arvin for the death of Sandy (both encounters on the same place) \n- Same old guy who helped young Arvin and welcomed him back in town. \n- Same bar Willard went to after Charlotte\u2019s death and where Lee\u2019s financer Leroy does his trades\n- Arvin\u2019s uncle mentions a shotgun when he first hands Arvin Willard\u2019s gun. It was a shotgun Lee used to hunt down Arvin. \n- After they killed, both Roy and Arvin gets a ride from Carl and Sandy. \n\nWith 2 generations of characters, both following their parents\u2019 foot steps (Lenora followed Helen, Arvin followed Willard), it makes you think they\u2019re making the same mistakes all over again (that\u2019s why it resembles Gabriel Garcia Marquez\u2019s 100 Years of Solitude). The recurrent themes of violence, faith, and fate (more on this later) are well established in the film. \n\nThe narration did put me off at first but the attention to detail on how all these people\u2019s stories got intertwined really got me interested. This is where the theme of \u201cfate\u201d comes in. It makes you think, of all people who would give Roy and Arvin a ride, why Sandy and Carl? Of all the people who would investigate on Preston, Sandy and Carl\u2019s deaths, why Lee? Both Roy and Arvin \u201cwanted to escape\u201d, only to find serial killers giving them a ride. Lenora realized she shouldn\u2019t kill herself, only to slip and end up dead. Sandy wanted to end things with Carl but it was that same day Carl gave her blanks so she ends up dead too. On the other hand Arvin almost gets killed by Carl, Sandy and Lee but lived on. Was it fate \u2014 a higher being responsible for all of it? Regardless, it makes for good storytelling. \n\nI may be reading too much into it but doesn\u2019t change the fact this film was intricately made, with stellar performances from the ENTIRE cast (even Mia Wasikowska\u2019s minor character had her moments).", "Loved that the Luger was more powerful than the shotgun after all.", "It was a slow burner but I liked it a lot. Strong performance all around.\n\nI do want to say Harry Melling has had an amazing couple of roles recently. Even in shit movies like the Old Guard he has good presence and is always weird as fuck.", "I loved how close everything came to being different... Jason Clark and skaarsgard trading place at the diner, that leads to no serial killer marriage in the Sheriff\u2019s family, no death of his wife, Arvin has his parents, etc. the connection coming together was awesomely done in this movie. Poor Arvin, trying to do the right thing but just can\u2019t come out on top. Great movie", "Loved this movie.  I haven't read the book so I can't compare but I just dug all the intertwining vignettes of crime, religion, desperation, etc.   The performances were great, it looked amazing, I see some complaints about the pacing but I feel that was just the way the story was told.  I'd definitely give this a solid 8/10.   \n  \nSomeone in an earlier thread called it 'an ultra violent Love Actually' which I think is a pretty damn good description lol.", "Great movie, great acting, but it misses the mark as far as adaptation goes. The movie does a lot to lighten and tone down just how dark and depressing that book is. It also just doesn't do enough for the characters because it really doesn't have the time to linger on things in general. Just imagine all the characters way worse.", "Having read the book I definitely enjoyed this movie. But, I feel that if you haven't read the book it may seem a little all over the place. If you enjoyed the movie definitely read the book! It isn't too long and it really dives further into the motivations of the characters. Also why did Willard get the donut and not the meatloaf???? Lol", "Am I the only one who found it funny that the guy who picked up Tom Holland at the end looked kinda like Jesus Christ lmao", "It's crazy how most of the cast are not Americans.", "i just watched this today and i really liked it! i didnt understand the plot with the brother cop and the bar owner and his thug though", "Well this movie was really frustrating.  The acting, score and premise were all great imo. I loved the vibe of the movie and got very sucked into it.  But...the ending was pretty unsatisfying. There was nowhere near enough character development for the Sheriff in particular - the showdown between him and Arvin should have been emotionally tense, but they didn't give us a reason to care if the Sheriff survived and they didn't give us a reason to be fearful of him. So instead of being on the edge of my seat I found that scene pretty \"meh\".\n\nAlso the narration.  I don't mind narration but it has to actually add something to the story, and the majority of the time it didn't.\n\nSo overall I enjoyed it, but I'm inclined to agree that it would have been better as a miniseries with more time to develop the Sheriff/serial killer storyline.", "Robert's performance though.", "DEEELLUUUUUSSIIIIOOONS", "This movie was really great. Lenora's death was so brutal and shocking I actually couldn't believe it. I really liked how this movie represented faith in 2 ways. The first, being that it was complete bullshit because most of the characters were super religious and had nothing but misery and tragedy come upon them. However, the second way faith could be interpreted is that God was really playing the role of an active character in the film making sure those who did wrong by him got what they deserved. That would explain why Arvin somehow survived so many near death experiences because he was the only person who was truly acting selflessly. (I would also like to think that the narrator in this film was the devil sadistically watching God mess with these peoples lives)\n\nThe weakest part of the film for me was the entire Sheriff plot-line as he didn't really serve a purpose whatsoever except to bring a climatic moment in the forest. The writers/director didn't bother fleshing out his character much, they just kind of threw him into random scenes so we'd be familiar with his face before his purpose was served with the intense forest scene.", "Loved this movie, one of the best of this year that I've seen.\n\nI've seen multiple comments saying they wish it was a series, thank God it wasn't. I'm getting tired of stories that should be a movie getting dragged into a 10 hour long TV series that seems to spin its wheels. I'd rather a longer movie.", "I really liked the film's ideas of delusions that people convince themselves and others with to justify henious evil acts, and the choices people make that eventually get followed up with consequences that happen through some twisted string of fate bestowed on us by God. The concept of choice, delusions, coincidence, fate and how it's all linked to the strings of good and evil controlled by God.\n\nIt seems like the aftermath of this terrible war is what sparked this long string of events that leads to so much evil, but that evil was eventually given its justice by the hand of God through Arvin himself. I mean think about it, that cafe scene in the beginning is where quite abit of the characters started. The strings of fate seemed to lead Willard to meet his future wife and give birth to his son, but it also brought together two people who would go down a path of evil who would eventually be destroyed by Arvin. Its this twisted string of fate that allows the evil and the good that destroys that evil to exist. An interesting concept.", "This might be my favourite Netflix film not named Marriage Story or the Irishman. Tremendous stuff.\n\nLike if True Detective S1 met Shawshank Redemption.", "Not much else I can say about this film except phenomenal performances all round, Bill Skarsgard especially (not to give all the praise to Tom Holland). Netflix, and online streaming services in general, are absolutely on the verge of taking over and I can\u2019t see how there won\u2019t be some Oscar buzz from their two recent releases; The Devil All The Time and I\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things. \n\nChristopher Nolan is undoubtably one of my favourite directors, and although I am yet to see Tenet, films that don\u2019t scream \u2018blockbuster\u2019 have become my preferred choice for a while now, and I think the pandemic may have converted some others too.", "I do want to start off by saying that I really think this is an interesting film and that it was well made with great production design, cinematography, and acting performances.  I think it definitely has things it wants to say about how people justify their own evil actions, and it looked at religious influence on humanity in a really interesting light.  I appreciated also how it did not play safe and was willing to take risks with its story.  However, I found this film extremely intense and dark and not in a good way.  Although I was expecting that given the subject matter, I couldn't help, this film really hit me in a way many other dark films didn't.  I usually find the darkness in films like the ones made by Lee Chang-Dong, still tolerable due to the themes it is targeting, especially since they get me thinking, but I found that this film really made me feel like I had a really terrible nightmare afterward.  It felt like a lot of the violence was done for>!shock value purely, especially the scenes when the solider was getting castrated by Carl or when Roy killed his wife.!<  I'm not sure if this is because I'm in a rough place emotionally at the moment, but I just had a really bad time with this, and I think it will be a while till I touch it again.  I really do want to give this film another chance and rewatch because the performances are incredible, some of the dialogue was very well written, and I can tell that Antonio Campos really put a lot of passion in this film, but I think it'll be a while before I can handle this again, especially given how negatively I found it to impact me emotionally.\n\nI also found that I partially disagree with the film's message.  I do agree that hypocrisy, especially caused by the abuse of power, is a major problem that must be addressed and recognized, and I was glad this film addressed it in a mature manner.  However, it seemed like the film had a nihilistic view point on life and endorsed the belief that humanity is evil.  I personally am someone who believes that [humanity is inherently good](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/icz904/i_believe_that_all_people_and_humanity_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), so I found that I have trouble agreeing with this stance, although I understand where it is coming from and I respect the opinions of those who feel so especially given the unfortunate scenarios that occur in everyday life.\n\nI hope you all really enjoyed this, though, and if you did, I am glad you did!  It'll be super interesting to see what Tom Holland does after this because I loved his performance in this, and he definitely got me hooked.\n\nHave a nice day!", "Fantastic film. Nothing groundbreaking.\n\nAlmost like a slice of life. Very Manga-esque and nihilistic. Japan tends to overdo it's sentimentality and it felt like that here.\n\nI think it bordered on absurdity but not the point of ruining the movie.", "I wish they would have explored some characters more. Carl and Sandy were pretty prolific serial killers. Would have been neat to hear news reports or conversations about it in scenes that didn\u2019t involve them. Bodecker\u2019s dirty cop subplot was pointless and I think it would have been more impactful for him to be a good cop who only chooses to go against the law to protect the info about his sister from getting out. I mean, Carl and Sandy were already dead at that point anyway. It would have also mirrored Arvin\u2019s story. Just two guys protecting their sisters.", "lol at a bunch of reviewers giving 1\u2019s on imdb complaining about how it\u2019s trendy to criticize religion.. besides the fact that it\u2019s based on a book", "As soon as that hippie van pulled up alongside Arvin at the end, I thought about how it was 1965, and immediately went \"oh shit, is Charles Manson in the hippie van???\" Arvin would introduce himself, and then the hippie would say his name is Charles, but his friends call him Charlie, or something. Hippie, of course, has long hair, and a beard, like Manson, but says he's going to Cincinnati. Quick Google search, and I discover Manson was born in Cincinnati. Personal headcanon is that that hippie really was Charlie, given that Arvin's life keeps getting worse and worse, and it only seems natural for him to get mixed up with a dude like that by then. Anyway, I liked it overall, and thought Pattinson did a great job as a narcissistic, predatory preacher, and the guy that played Roy was mega creepy, but it suited the role well. I thought Bill Skarsgaard would have more screentime, but that crucified dog was the creepiest thing I've seen in a long time. Like 7/10 overall", "It was relentlessly dark but it really felt like a breath of fresh air. I'm glad to see Tom Holland taking on something like this.", "Pattinson can do no wrong in my eyes. He alone elevated the movie at least a half star for me. Also maybe the first time I\u2019ve enjoyed a Jason Clarke performance", "It was alright. The performances were great though. Holland doesnt dissapear into his character as much as his co-stars do, but I look forward to seeing him in more none MCU movies. \n\nAlso, Robert Pattinson is one of the best actors around.", "I really didn't understand Sandy's character and why she kept flip flopping between wanting to get away and being a willful participant in things.", "I really liked the movie. Dark, but the acting was superb and it kept me interested the whole way through.\n\nDoes anyone else think this movie doesn't exactly have a happy ending that it tries to convey? It ends with Arvin drifting to sleep daydreaming about his future. Going to war or starting a family. Seeing his aunt and uncle again. In my eyes there is pretty much no way any of that is going to happen. He was already the lead suspect in the murder of a Reverend. He killed 2 more people that picked him up and gave him a ride. Then kills a police officer in a shootout at his original house.\n\nEveryone now knows with almost certainty that these were all him. He was already a suspect and now a witness can place him in the town where he killed a cop outside of his old house as well. He's going to jail. You can argue that all of those people deserved to die and I wouldn't have anything against that, but in the eyes of the law he has killed 4 people and everyone knows it was him. He's going to jail for life or will be executed.", "I recognise that it\u2019s a well made movie with great performances across the board and I enjoyed the second half a lot more but I was disappointed overall and I think that the pacing was a big factor.\n\nThe relentless horrific acts just became predictable, every scene you knew someone was going to be killed or raped etc. Most characters being bad people didn\u2019t help either. \n\nThis was a problem particularly in the first half as it was so fast paced that you don\u2019t get time to sit with any of the characters so when horrible things happened to them I didn\u2019t feel as horrified as I should.", "Agree with a lot of the criticisms already stated here and feel like it got about 75% of the way there.  The choice to include a narrator was a miss, as it really wasn\u2019t needed.  There\u2019s nothing that couldn\u2019t be explained by an additional line of dialogue, which in most cases wasn\u2019t even necessary. \n\nEven though the serial killer plot line was taken directly from the novel (assumption), I think the movie would have been better served just omitting this all together.  It wasn\u2019t really interwoven until the very end and I feel like just focusing on the \u201csins of our fathers\u201d theme would have given the other characters room to breathe.", "Just watched the movie today hated the dog part but damn I thought it was a pretty good movie tbh Loved the cast.

Weddings, local commercials, training videos and the like. Every year, our biggest cash cow was recording dance recitals for the local dance studios. We\u2019re talking being paid to run a 4-camera crew for 7 hours, then selling the tapes for $40/ea to every parent, grandparent, and aunt of every dancer in the troupe.\n\nTroupe ages ranged from 3-17.\n\nEvery year we did this shoot made me uncomfortable and some of the dance routines, I just had to hand off to another editor that wasn\u2019t as uncomfortable. Really really young girls, doing very sensual dances to aggressively sexual music or music that seemed innocent but had clear sexual meanings of you were an adult. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable having the footage of those routines on my personal computer to work on from home.\n\nYears later, an old friend from high school has kids that are in the local troupes, and the posts of her kids in their dance outfits and videos of the routines are so sexualized that I had to block her posts from my feed, just because I didn\u2019t want someone to see me scrolling through my newsfeed, thinking I was watching that stuff or part of some pedo group.\n\nOh, that reminds me, as an aside: I used to work at a social media company and we would work with law enforcement investigations all the time (like daily) to bring down these pedo rings. They collect images like these from public Facebook profiles, and trade them like baseball cards. Pretty vile.\n\nHere\u2019s my point. The stuff that\u2019s the subject matter off this film is extremely real and *happening right now in your town*. I promise you.

The main character comes from one extreme in terms of cultural suppression, but throws herself in the complete opposite extreme, both of which are failures in our society. I live in the USA and can strongly attest that people over the age of 30 have no clue how to educate children about sex and are either too hands off or overly suppressive. Whenever my little cousins show me tik tok I often question how any of these children get away with these things. There is an argument to be made that showing these girls in sexual acts is excessive and the message can be made without it, but on the other hand you can argue maybe the metaphorical left jab isn\u2019t as strong as a right hook.

Liked the film.  Very glad to see some thoughtful conversation going on here.  \n\nI wanted to point out something I thought was really interesting.  In 1966, Ousmane Sembene made a film called \"Black Girl,\" which is considered the first real piece of African cinema where an African director had creative control.  It's about a black woman who comes to France, expecting to work as a nanny, but is instead exploited and abused.  The lead actress was Mbissine Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Diop, who disappeared into obscurity in the 70s.\n\nAnd lo and behold, it's Diop playing Amy's auntie here in \"Cuties.\"  Another story about the African/French immigrant experience.", "This was very hard to watch, but the movie frames everything the characters are doing as insane. \n\nThe marketing for this movie was absolutely messed up.", "I would like that start off with that I do NOT agree with the clothing choices nor the close up shots of children's butts and crotches. This is not the unpopular part of my opinion.  \n\nAfter reading all of the posts, I decided I would watch the movie myself. I would have agreed with everyone's comments if the movie did indeed portray what people were saying, but after watching the movie, I believe everyone is so (rightfully) hung up on the lack of clothing and the style of \"dance\", that they are missing the purpose of the movie. I believe the movie brought to light a VERY REAL ISSUE. Now, people may think and say \"the issue is not as extreme as the movie is portraying\" or \"these issues don't start so young\". As someone who was raised in an unhealthy environment,  these issues and actions DID start at a very young age for myself and my friends. We did a lot of things these girls are doing because we had no one to sit down with us and explain right from wrong and WHY those actions were wrong. We also didn't have an adult figure to see how deeply we were truly hurting. People assume 11 year olds are innocent and care free, a lot of times, this is not the case. \n\nI am going to break it down into parts:\n\n1. The movies focus: The focus was not on the dancing (yes, there was a lot of dancing but, in my opinion, it wasn't the focus like, lets say, Bring It On) but instead the mental health of the main character. She just moved; is very VERY poor; is raised with traditions that are uncommon, unexplained to her, and sometimes abusive; and she finds out that her father is marrying a second wife. Ontop of her father marrying a second wife, his room is locked off until his new wife and him arrive. When her and her friend break into it, they find that it is beautifully decorated and full of expensive things while her mother, her two brothers, and herself are living very poorly and ragged. \n\n2. The childrens behavior: This is how they are coping. They don't have anyone to explain to them what is going on nor how to properly cope, and the movie DOES touch base on that. The 2nd main character out of the \"cuties\" expresses, as she is crying, how her parents are never around anymore because they are always working and how they always blame her for everything. You even hear her father yell at her to be quite (when her brother is the one who started it) because he is trying to sleep in the middle of the day and her mother is no where to be seen. When the mother and Aunt of the main character find out what she has been doing, they hit her, splash her with holy water, and call in a priest to see if she is possessed a demon.\n\n3. The coping skills themselves: they are not extreme, it is what social media and their peers are advising them to do to make them happy and \"cool.\"\n\n4. The condoning of the behavior: ALMOST NO ONE IS CONDONING THIS BEHAVIOR and they make it obvious. The main character's mother and Aunt are angry with her. The 2nd main character's parents are angry with her. During the final dance, a mother covers the eyes of a young girl and other audience members make faces (yes, some seem to be enjoying it but this just adds into the sad factor that some people are unfortunately okay with this behavior). One of the two guards they were \"dancing\" for is like \"wtf\" to the other guard that is enjoying it. And lastly, but not least, the friend group kicks out the main character for posting a crotch picture online because they didn't agree with it.\n\n5. The drowning scene: A lot of people are saying \"she almost killed someone\". This is far from true. She pushes the girl into the lake out of desperation. When the girl struggles to swim, the main character has fear, shock, and pitty on her face. She doesn't \"just stand there\" she is making she sure doesn't drown. She doesn't leave until the other girl makes it safely to the booey.\n\n6. The way the movie ends: The crowd doesn't go wild and they win first place. She has a break down in the middle of the competition and runs home to her mom during her fathers wedding. We, for the first time, she her mother stand up for her to her Aunt and show compassion for her daughter. She tells her that she doesn't have to come to the wedding if she doesn't want to and then heads to the wedding herself. It cuts to the girl walking to the wedding, not in the traditional dress that was expected of her to wear (which played a big role in the movie and caused her lots of stress) nor in the usual inappropriate clothing she had been wearing, but in a modern and very appropriate attire for an 11 year old.\n\nThese girls were confused and sad and made rash decisions because they were young. Lots of children today are going through hard situations and are turning to social media, friends equally confused and sad, and unhealthy coping skills. We need more light on the issue. I agree having exposed children is not the way to go about that, but we do need something that shows us the harsh reality of what is going on. We sometimes look over things when we don't see how brutal things really are. Maybe we should let this movie only start a movement to have Netflix take it down, but also a movement to find ways to help our children. #HelpOurChildren", "Spoilers below. I just watched Cuties. I think it did a good job of saying what it wanted to say, and I think it was really well made. A couple of scenes got a bit gratuitous and I'm not defending exposing the kids to that for the sake of art, but as art, it did a very good job of what it wanted to do. The girl who played Ami was a brilliant actor, and none of the scenes, within the context of the plotline, seemed unnecessary. Gratuitous to us but necessary for the story. There's good juxtaposition around all of the themes in the film. The scene where they first try to be \"sexy\" is mixed in with them eventually giving in to not being able to do those moves and giggling and behaving like children. I think it's a very realistic film, and that it might be helpful for young teens to see it and think about the themes in it, because they'll certainly be exposed to it in their actual lives anyway and it does send a good message. \n\n The hyperconservative family literally beats her for behaving like a whore and shaming the family. The kids at school bully her for not being sexy enough, and then bully her for being too sexy. A kid even slaps her ass and calls her a slut for posting an erotic picture to social media. Before that happens, everyone is bullying her telling her she is too much of a child. Also before that, she gets her period and her mother calls her a woman. Then her dad treats her like a kid and the picture was taken during an emotional scene where she is doing it to prove that she is in control of her body and her life. This is her \"going too far\" within the movie's plot, and even her friends who want to be sexy and pretend to be older stop being her friends for being a slut by posting the picture and making them look bad. \n\nThe way it is shot definitely is meant to send a message. The story sends a stronger message. The film ends with her mom accepting her and her finding her own place not as an adult or kid, but a person. She dresses like an adult, but not sexy. She discards both the formal dress her family wanted her to wear and the dance outfit to put on regular clothes and be a regular person, and then goes outside and happily jumps rope, each time going higher and higher until she truly soars under her own power.\n\n\nThe film kind of reminds me of little miss sunshine. A child in that film did a very sexy dance during a child beauty pageant that, just like in this film, also creeped out everybody within the scene. The child in that scene is very awkward though and it comes off as silly. The only thing these kids do is a better job at being sexy, which is why I think it's uncomfortable for people while little miss sunshine was well received. In little miss sunshine, the kid was oblivious and just wanted to dance. The actor was still exposed to that though, and exploited in the same way, and she was 9 or 10 when it was filmed. In this film, the kids are far from oblivious because their own sexualization is getting thrown in their faces. Creepy pedophile security guards, guys flirting with them online (and then yelling at them for being too young) boys in the park flirting with them until they learn their age and get scared away. It's all very real. The thing is though, the actors were not completely exposed to this, the director made the scenes into games to help de-sexualize the scenes during filming.\n\n\nIf anyone watches it, I highly recommend watching it in French.\n\n\nIf it were a book or an animated film that didn't use children, I think it would have gotten a really good response for talking about something that needs to be talked about in our society.\n\nAlso, I've been around the internet enough to have seen some shit, and I know that there exists video online of kids dancing and twerking like that, which is why I say it's a very realistic film. Girls that age are told to be adults and sexy, and try to fit in to adulthood as early and as best as they can, and there's so much sexualization thrown in their faces from everywhere that it's something that should be talked about. Like, there's a reason they make toy toolboxes and toy ovens for little kids, and that's because little kids want to be just like mommy and daddy, and they know mommy makes food and daddy goes to work because he's a man and that's what men do. Think about how wrong that is to teach kids, and realize the older kids get, the more they see of the world. Suddenly they're exposed to more than just mommy and daddy, and things are different and they want to fit in just like they did playing with their easy bake ovens or their pretend tools. Maybe they have an older sibling that is exposed to it, maybe their parents like to watch movies while they're in the room. Every movie, every TV show, every commercial, everything tells you how sexy it is to be sexy, and forces that shit on you, and you as a person are going to want to be a part of that. That's how people are, as soon as they see what the norm is, they want to be a part of that even if they shouldn't. That's what this movie hits on, it isn't ever for a moment remotely arousing or pornographic to anyone but the depraved.\n\n\n\" Many of the film\u2019s scenes are derived from the anecdotes young girls had told Doucour\u00e9.\"\n\n\"There were actually many stories which were so far beyond what you see in the film, and I just did not have the artistic courage to tell those stories on the screen,\u201d says Doucour\u00e9. \u201cStories of young girls who are 12 years old and prostituting themselves. All of these stories just made my blood run cold, and it made me even more determined to make this film, and to speak out about this issue that is so prevalent in today\u2019s society.\u201d\n\n  The casting and production process too emphasized realism. Doucour\u00e9 and her team saw almost 700 young girls in their casting search, and those who were chosen for the film are all acting for the first time. \u201cBecause they were children, I worked in a specific way,\u201d Doucour\u00e9 says, describing the games she played on set with the children and how she encouraged them to visualize themselves as different animals to help with the characterization. It is this combination of childlike naivety and overt sexuality that sometimes makes for uneasy viewing, as viewers are forced to position their gaze on the bodies of Amy and the Cuties.\n\nIt's a fantastic film and it doesn't deserve any of the hate it is receiving.\n\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to add, I think, compared to shit like this, there's no controversy to be had here.\n\n>Toddlers & Tiaras or Another Toddlers & Tiaras is an American reality television series that aired on TLC from January 27, 2009, to October 16, 2013. After a three-year hiatus due to much controversy, Another Toddlers and Tiaras aired the sequel on August 24, 2016. The show follows the personal lives of families of contestants in a child beauty pageant. Like many shows about children pageants, it generated controversy for dressing the children provocatively. The show led to other reality show spin-offs: Eden's World, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, and Cheer Perfection. On November 24, 2016, TLC cancelled the show after its 7th season.", "I thought it was incredible. Full stop. Really eye opening for me, because I couldn't relate to any of those experiences. I loved how the director showed how women/girls are socialized to weaponize their sexuality against men(that scene with her brother was so cringe but impactful). \n\nOkay, there were some questionable shot choices and I think that the \"pants pulling down\" scene was totally unnecessary. She could have cut away to shocked faces instead of showing a child's butt. \n\nThe thing is I don't know what the \"solution\" is. Women entertainers should be allowed to be as sexual as they want and celebrities are not responsible for anyone's children. Maybe the conversation should be that mainstream women entertainers are only allowed to be successful when they are hypersexual. Why is that?", "Thanks France, this is exactly what my armed and crazy QAnon obsessed nation needed right now.\n\nEDIT: actually thanks Netflix for that godawful poster. What the hell were they thinking??", "I'm gonna watch this film only because of the outrage it's generating on Reddit.", "Is it really as bad as they say??? I have to admit I kind of assumed it was just a foreign film that didn't fit an American point of view and freaked people out.", "I've haven't seen this movie, and probably never will just doesn't look like the type of movie I'd want to watch, but can I just say I hate people who are just going around calling anyone defending this movie pedophiles.\n\nIt literally shuts down any sort of discussion or conversation about the subject", "It\u2019s like if someone made a movie about children abusing drugs in low income areas, a sad and very real subject that is arguably a noble subject for a movie to tackle, but when they were shooting, they handed actual crack to 11 year olds and told them to go nuts. Yes, sexual exploitation of children is an actual and serious subject that needs to be addressed, but not by sexually exploiting more children.", "I watched it thinking it couldn\u2019t be as bad as people were saying. \n\nIt was worse.", "One of the dumbest movies ever. Main girl literally ruins the music group at each opportunity. Getting into fights. Taking that nude picture.\n\n BEGGING to be let back into the group, and when she's not, she sabotaged the group again by pushing Yasmin into the water so she herself can take her place in the competition final only for her THEN to be like \"nah\" and immediately just leave during the performance. Fucking lmao.\n\nReminded me of the redhead dude in \"Frank\", who wanted to be liked so much in the band, and tried to \"help\", he ended up doing mostly harm.", "I saw the movie and understood it... I am not saying I liked it but as a mother I have some idea what influences kids nowadays. Very hard to be a kid especially when you do not have a parent who you can trust and who can tell you what is right and what is wrong and where the limits are. And in this movie parents were absent. So there is that.\n\nOn the other hand let me add one more thing to the big picture: I know some African families and I see what some muslim (but also Christian) (pre)teen girls are doing on social media. I see their Facebook stories and their photos and let me tell you that sometimes they are closer to the dancing scenes (*with some exaggeration)* than the praying scenes in the movie. You can imagine the tik tok like short videos with sensual facial expression, little dance moves, etc.  \nThey also have a lot of huge parties, too and it is their mother who dress them up and apply excessive make up on them, so a 10 year old girl would look like an 18 year old one. \n\nSo all I am saying is that whoever thinks that the movie shows the two extremes (muslim vs Western culture) has no idea about real life.", "so how was she keeping that stolen phone charged?", "\"It's a movie that denounces children exploitation by exploiting children\"  \n\n\nBut thats not what the movies about. People are so concerned about how pedos look at the movie, but not what children like Amy are exposed to every single day. They imitate what they see on social media, for us it was an uncomfortable couple of mins, but for them its information that they absorb constantly by their environment.  \n\n\nTo list some examples, Amy watches more mature dance videos and apply them to their own dance routine. Her group acknowledges that it makes them look more like adults and she becomes friends with that circle. A goal that Amy has wanted to achieve since she first saw them in the beginning of the movie.  \n\n\nLater on in the movie, in which is the most uncomfortable scene was when they were dancing on the stairs. Crotch shots, etc, I had to look away and I was completely baffled at why this was happening. A few minutes later, Amy was looking at her phone and saw those likes on her phone skyrocket based on that uncomfortable scene.  \n\n\nIf you only thought about only that dance scene, its horrific. But to those kids, that dance gave them an opportunity to get massive attention and is basically a massive dopamine rush. And its that difference in perspective that I feel really trips people up.   \n\n\nThe final dance is where both perspectives collide where the kids believe that doing a \"mature\" dance gains the most support, yet the adults are booing them as it is a very uncomfortable to watch. One thing I did notice, was that there was a kid that wanted to watch it.  \n\n\nTo me, this movie is more about understanding the motives  of children like Amy, the tells, and the impacts of social media. If you hate the exploitation of children that this movie presents, then as a adult, you should be horrified. But for someone like Amy, it's Tuesday.", "Going to have to agree with Wubbys take https://youtu.be/exCNHEGnZ5M", "DISCLAIMER: I do not condone or agree with some of the methods used to make this film. Especially Netflix's marketing. But we're on movies so I'm hoping someone is willing to have an actual conversation about the substance of the film...\n\nThe movie is fascinating, uncomfortable and real as fuck. The drive to be free of a perceived oppressive upbringing but taking it too far to the extreme opposite, is the quintessential cautionary tale. Which make no mistake, Cuties is.\n\nIt is actually the adults in Amy's life that first frame her as a woman and not a child. This 11 year old is told not only is she now a grown woman, but she could be expected to marry soon. Taking that mantle, she begins to explore what that means as she finds herself in a much more sex positive and progressive community than she was brought up in. Seeing her own mothers struggles with male oppression leads Amy to seek out role models elsewhere. There are inherent dangers in that path. This is a story worth exploring and I believe the film excelled in that aspect. The girls actions are never celebrated, this movie isn't interested in condoning the sexualization of children either. \n\nNetflix is a whole other discussion.\n\nThere are shots that certainly could have been framed better. Typical shots for a dance film but when imposed on young children, warrant questioning. Was that malicious or the faults of a freshman director? What was the atmosphere on set? Were these children given guidance and context or just made to move in \"sexy\" ways? If the director had just pushed focus or moved the center of the frame a few times, I'm certain there'd be way less fervor now.\n\nA good contrast with these \"gratuitous\" scenes is the one where Amy's mom and aunt strip her down and pelt her with cold water. None of the shots focused on her body the way the dancing scenes do. She's dressed as scantily, if not more. She's moving in similar ways but there it's not condemned by her family as vial dancing, suggesting it's par for the course for such a ritual. It wasn't sexual, it was spiritual. Is it different because the women then hold control of her body? (I freely admit my ignorance of Islamic(?) culture/customs/religion but am willing to be educated)\n\nThere's a lot to dissect about this movie, and I welcome civil discussion or questioning, but these were my strongest initial thoughts. \n\nAlso: I challenge anyone in here to describe what they were looking at/doing during puberty. How different was it?\n\nEDIT: ITT an astounding amount of ignorance of the ways children are exploited everyday in real life & an unfortunately unsurprising amount of people who have no understanding of human sexuality or biology. tldr: This movie challenged people and that makes them scared and angry", "It\u2019s horrible. I feel bad for those girls. The message is suppose to be about how bad the sexualization of children is, but.. If you\u2019re willing to sexualize children just to make a movie about it, is it really that bad? It\u2019s horrible, but also let\u2019s turn around and do the thing we\u2019re condemning to children. \n\nI really don\u2019t get why people are defending this, and I also don\u2019t understand why the director couldn\u2019t have hired adult people that can consent to this sort of thing. I have a friend that has a disorder to where she looks really young, around 13 years old, even though she\u2019s an adult. People who are adults that just look young would have been fine for this movie, and it would have gotten the point across just fine. It would have been uncomfortable, and no children would have been harmed in the making of this film.

It\u2019s art.", "Trying to bring awareness to something by contributing or the thing you want to bring awareness too. Child actors in the film are still children.", "I think some people misunderstood the message of the film. It's not simply *oversexualizing kids is bad*, we all should already know that. The message is more like ***oversexualizing ADULTS has the unintentional consequence of affecting kids in the same way***. The movie shows that these kids had no idea what they were doing or what sex is. They were simply **imitating** what adults do in video clips and social media. It served to show that this behavior can happen without any intent. Kids can't differentiate what is sexually suggestive (unless you teach them). They will copy whatever behavior gets them more attention and makes them popular.\n\nAnother message of the movie is the opposites between the hyper conservative side of the parents (in this case a Muslim family where the father was adding a second wife to the family, and the mother of the protagonist just had to accept it) and the hyper sexualized side of the social media where kids are de facto being raised nowadays.", "[deleted]", "This movie reminded me of Kids. People don't understand that them feeling outraged and offended over those scenes is the entire point. I defintely felt uncomfortable watching it. But that is how the director wants you to feel. We shouldnt be happy about how they were treated but then look at how people are treating thier actual kids like in the boy scouts or ~~that reality show with the angry mother~~ Dance Moms. The movie is a reflection of us and it seems it is hitting close to home for quite a few people.", "I get the message, it is true and looking at some of the comments its happenning locally in a lot of places. But this way was not the right execution.", "Why are people riding so hard for this movie when Dance Moms and those other shows did worse?

And I can see why it will make other men, parents, and kids uncomfortable as well. I get the marketing outrage. But my takeaway is that the film is being told from the perspective of girls who are coming of age. Yes, its easy to believe that the film grossly oversexualizes young girls, and that theyre being exploited. But the director chose to make a film that shows us the uncomfortable, but real experiences of many young girls out there. Young women go through the same peer pressures, the same misguided role models, the same uncomfortable trauma that is puberty, the same cultural pressures and frustrations from their elders, and yes, the same wanting to be seen as a sexually mature adult, as these girls experience in the film. It will be hard to understand the point of this movie from the perspective of a grown man, and easy to dismiss  this as a sick, disgusting product of society. But at the end of the day, film is just art with an intended audience, albeit a very niche one  and for many (but not all) women, young and older, this film will resonate and validate their experiences.", "The message of sexualising kids being bad is immediately lost as soon as they start doing pornographic ass and crotch shots", "I'm fascinated that no one has verbally connected the dots regarding the complaint of \"these were child actors, why not use adults?\" Is it not clear that part of what warps a child's sense of self is seeing middle school and high school-aged characters portrayed by adults, doing things adults do? You take a show like Riverdale or (more old school) One Tree Hill or Gossip Girl and show people CLEARLY in their late 20s and 30s drinking and fucking and expect actual high schoolers not to think that's a somewhat accurate reflection of themselves?", "This movie seems sensitive because people are assuming these scenarios aren't reality for many kids. Most of their moves, especially in that last routine, can be traced back to many music videos easily reachable on YouTube, and TikTok.\n\nIf you're made uncomfortable watching it - that is the point.

I tried to watch the film with an open mind, but after having seen the poster and having read a lot of the arguments for and against the movie beforehand, I went in expecting some kind of commentary about \u201cdance mom\u201d-type competitions or on the societal pressures for young girls to act \u201csexy\u201d or even on \u201cfemale empowerment.\u201d However, I found that the film isn\u2019t really focused on any of those things.\n\nThe film seems more about exploring young girls\u2019 natural curiosities about womanhood and presenting the consequences that can happen when those girls don\u2019t have proper guidance, especially in a world in which the Internet is widely available. \n\nAs many have pointed out, the film very much frames the girls\u2019 dancing as inappropriate for their age, but it also makes it pretty obvious that none of the girls have received any guidance from the adults in their lives. In fact, a few of the girls\u2019 parents are shown as absent, ignorant, or neglectful. One girl\u2019s mother is completely absent, and the girl\u2019s only instruction for growing up is to be more like her older brother. Another girl\u2019s mother is present, but ignorant, serving the girls food and drinks as they chat about sex online with a man who is unaware of their ages. And then there\u2019s Amy\u2019s mother, a Senegalese immigrant who is so distracted by her husband\u2019s upcoming marriage to another woman that she ends up neglecting a lot of her daughter\u2019s issues. She has trouble talking openly with her daughter about puberty and her emotions concerning her father\u2019s new marriage which inadvertently leads Amy to seek comfort and acceptance from the other girls. As Amy observes the girls try to imitate the older girls that they see on the Internet, she attempts to do the same in order to fit in. The only guidance that Amy ever receives from an adult comes from her aunt who pushes a traditional idea of womanhood in which women are meant to be subservient to the men in their lives and in which they should expect to be married in adolescence. She takes no issue with Amy\u2019s father taking a second wife either and insists that Amy respect her father\u2019s decision. Amy certainly does not see this as the kind of guidance she is looking for, and I assume that many viewers would agree.\n\nAs Amy\u2019s mother continues to neglect her daughter, Amy becomes more determined to act like the adults that she and the other girls see in music videos and on social media. In the narrative, it is Amy who first calls the other girls\u2019 attention to twerking and teaches them how to imitate the dancers in the videos. No adults teach them or push them to do so, and no adults attempt to intervene. Despite Amy\u2019s worsening behavior, her mother never attempts to talk to her daughter until learning about the obscene photo that Amy shares on social media. But instead of talking her through the issue, she threatens to kill her.\n\nThe film is told from Amy\u2019s point of view and presents the lessons that she learns most clearly, but I think the film\u2019s most important lesson is shown in the way that the mother changes. After threatening to kill her daughter, the mother has a Muslim religious leader assure her that the devil is not in her daughter. She later comes to reconsider the way that she had been treating Amy. When Amy runs home after her breakdown on stage, she encounters her mother who is preparing to attend her husband\u2019s wedding. Instead of scolding Amy for her outfit or for attempting to skip the wedding, her mother gives Amy a choice to attend the wedding or not, admitting that she understands the importance of acknowledging her daughter\u2019s issues and perhaps setting up an opportunity for a longer discussion in the future.\n\nThis message ties into an issue that I\u2019ve seen mentioned in a lot of the discourse of Cuties: Did the actresses need to be so young? This is a question that I don\u2019t have a clear answer to, but I think that the director was trying to suggest that preteen girls are capable of having mature discussions about sex and sexuality. I would be surprised to find out that the director, these actresses, and their families did not have these conversations before filming the movie. As many have mentioned before, the dancing scenes in this movie seem designed to be disturbing but in doing so reflect that preteen girls are naturally curious about womanhood and that when shown media without context, they are capable of interpreting it in some shocking ways. I\u2019m not sure that using older actresses could have made that same point.\n\nIt\u2019s such a shame that Netflix\u2019s marketing and the discourse around this movie seem to have missed this point because the questions of when and how to talk to girls about womanhood in today\u2019s world seem relevant and worth asking. An honest discussion could possibly lead to genuine solutions to the problems of young sexualization that many are so worried about.", "I think the moral panic over this movie is so fucking bizarre. Is it unsettling? Yes absolutely. Is it supposed to be? Fucking yes. I think it\u2019s a strong movie that shows the absolute fucked up behavior of those involved in dance. \n\nLike I\u2019d understand if the director was like \u201cthis shit is cool\u201dbut that\u2019s so clearly not the message that they\u2019re sending. It also being directed by a women who was involved with this sort of thing makes me not sure why people are thinking she\u2019s some sort of pedo.\n\nThe fact that people want her thrown in jail or Netflix executives (seriously the takes I\u2019ve seen) is ridiculous. I\u2019ve seen people say that \u201cdegeneracy in the modern world Is to blame\u201d and I feel like I\u2019m on crazy pills.

I watched this movie, and yes it\u2019s uncomfortable, but I see girls going through a normal exploration of womanhood and how to get validation and attention and unfortunately being allowed to or pushed to do it in public because, if you notice, none of them particularly had much supervision or seemed to get much attention from their parents. Notice the girl who takes things too far, Amy, is the one with the most conservative background because absolutely all of it is unacceptable to her family and she has no idea where the line after she became willing to play around with breaking the rules.\n\nThis is absolutely a movie by women, for women, and shot in a way that a lot of women (particularly those of us from Muslim families who grew up in majority non-Muslim countries) will recognize. I think people are getting so upset about this movie because of what it says about men that they didn\u2019t understand before, not because this isn\u2019t what goes on anyway.", "Anyone who seriously defends the blatant sexualization of 11 year old girls can go fuck themselves. People bend themselves over backwards, because the movie wants to provoke a reaction and because it calls out the sexualization of children.\n\nToo bad though that the movie, despite trying to portray it as something bad, shoots itself in the foot by blatantly sexualizing those young girls. It's like if I made a movie about how dangerous drinking while driving a car is and then have actors getting really drunk, and then driving a car. Your intent doesn't matter, if you did what you set out to portray as bad.", "I just finished watching the entire film and felt it was important to voice my opinion regarding it after I had seen it for myself. Watching Mignonnes reminded me of the first time I watched Harmony Korine\u2019s Kids as it doesn\u2019t sugarcoat how a coming of age film appears in order to deliver an important message. It is a beautiful film and the inclusion of Senegalese culture as well as the different elements of French culture in here adds dimension to somebody watching who isn\u2019t a part of that culture.\n\nLet me make it clear, Mignonnes is clearly not Little Miss Sunshine as some of the other commenters have alluded to, nor should it even have to dumb down her perspective. She is clearly delivering a reflection on what is clearly her disapproval in the hypersexualization of kids. It is made blatantly clear that the kids in this film do struggle growing up in a culture where adult content is easily accessible but also one where adult guidance is scarce. Watching the film did make me feel sad and angry.\n\nWe are supposed to be uncomfortable with the film\u2019s depiction and it\u2019s clear near the ending of the film as well when the girls demonstrate their dance routine during the competition and in contrast with how the judges and the crowd feels about this routine.\n\nThis film made me think about what exactly resembles what the film depicts and it\u2019s a plethora of cultural aspects like a kid\u2019s exposure to Youtube and Tik Tok, cheerleading culture in high school, child beauty pageants in the States, reality TV, etc. It is strange for anybody making sense of the film to mindlessly critique the film without thinking of what in our society resembles what we are watching.\n\nOverall, it is a bold perspective that the director chose to helm the film in but it is one that yields a strong conviction of questioning why exactly our culture in general emphasizes hyper-sexualization especially for the future generation.", "Just watched the movie... oh boy... imo it was tasteless, unnecessary, and frankly quite disgusting...\n\nThere was a tasteful way to present the themes that this movie wanted to present (a young girl finding herself while living under an oppressive religious household)... they chose the direct opposite of that and made that instead. The ending was also quite jarring and came out of nowhere, almost like they understood that they were taking things too far and attempted to course correct but ran out of budget and time... \n\nI don't really understand why or how anyone could defend/support this movie, outside of sticking it to the conservatives, and that take is flimsy at best...

Plus it was really weird how if it was about social media hyper sexualizing women why was there men in the movie oogling her and her attempting to undressed herself to keep a phone but also upload a vag pic? Even when they found an used condom what was the point to dhow they was 11 yearold that had no idea on what they was doing? \n\nThey literally could of shown the empowerment of being a child or women in Muslim cultures and breaking through a better way. \n\nWhy did they have her have a twerk demon in her undies? \n\nWhy did they make her try to kill another kid? \n\nWhy all of a sudden she had an change of heart that she didn't want to dance anymore? \n\nWhy was the dress bleeding?

That was an important part of it, but it was only one part of the journey the main character took.  The movie does make it very clear all the way through that the dancing is a bad thing.  The main character also steals (including from her mom), gets into fights and is obsessed with social media and likes.  It makes it clear that all of this behavior is part of the same overall problem.  I couldn't help comparing it to Mean Girls.  In that movie the popular girls are the \"bad guys\", and the main character tries to fit in with them for most of the movie, but it's clear the whole time that the stuff she does to fit in with them isn't good.\n\nMild spoilers, although there's no twist or big reveal; this just describes the ending:\n\n>!In the end, she has an epiphany runs home to her mother and turns away from all of this behavior.  She doesn't exactly embrace her family's traditional values, but she does reject the dancing and everything that went with it.  This just makes it extra clear that everything she had gotten into was the wrong path.!<", "Watched it with my wife. Some things are best described in a book or perhaps via cartoon or comics. What made me uncomfortable was the fact that these are real children with names and a future. Because of this movie they will face a type of adversity that i don't think anyone can imagine, literally. It's like they were a guinea pig for the director's passion to raise awareness but in a really wrong way, completely undermining the movie's own message.", "Has anyone else noticed there is a HUGE amount of commenters here who NEVER post to /r/movies and comment almost exclusively in subreddits like conservative, Trump, conspiracy, etc?    \n   \nThe whole thread is a dumpster fire.  It's just people arguing with one another and repeating the same points over and over.  \n  \nHas there ever been a film with a bigger disconnect between critics and audiences?  A vast majority of the reviews have been extremely positive and I don't think I've seen any critical review mention 'pedophilia' or 'child porn' (or if they do it's explicitly to say the film is not that) but it's a large majority of the comments here.   \n  \nWhat's interesting is most of the posters who use those terms have comment history posting in right wing subreddits, sometimes just a few or sometimes it's just constant.  What is that about?  \n  \nEdit:  I found this article just now while reading through some reviews which also addresses that this is happening:  \n  \nhttps://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/cuties-mignonnes-the-extraordinary-netflix-debut-that-became-the-target-of-a-right-wing-campaign", "I know that this is kinda unpopular opinion but I appreciate  how the director approach this movie. I think this paragraph from [this review](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-angry-christian-right-should-watch-netflixs-cuties) express my feeling about the approach.\n\n> Doucour\u00e9\u2019s film rigorously examines the ways teen girls mimic the images they see on social media, the ones that tell them their bodies are all wrong, their presentation too childish, their lives unremarkable. **But instead of preaching to children on the basis of fear, Doucour\u00e9 is willing to look frankly at what is so appealing about lascivious dancing to girls too young to understand sex even on a very fundamental level.** The Cuties find a kind of power in their movement and have very little insight into the wider context of their self-sexualization. Yet, instead of listening and speaking to these young girls, asking them about their interests and figuring out how to support them in ways that don\u2019t threaten their ability to be children, the adults around them mostly respond with shame and rejection.\n\nThe bolded part is very true, I know that I hate to be preached so this approach works better why the protagonist did that. In the end, it just like some coming of age movies, the reason why Amy did those things are she want to be cool and fit in. I think in that sense, it is pretty relatable for many people.", "I really liked this movie. I think it was one few movies that I've ever seen that portrayed my experience (21F) as a child growing up in the internet age. I'm sure it's worse for young girls now. If you frequent female-dominated subs you would know that most of us get sexualized/harassed from a young age --- around 10/11 or younger. I can definitely see echoes of my childhood growing up in the way that these girls act and the way that they are reacted to. \n\nThere are certain scenes that are quite disturbing but I don't think that the film was exploitative of the actresses. I think they were mature enough to understand the material and be educated on the issues that the film presented, which is more than most of us can say that we had. The director also mentioned that she used composite shots a lot of the time. I hope that this film can make people see how young girls are exploited all around them so that they can do something about that, instead of trying to ban this movie.", "In my personal opinion of the film, it has a meaningful and important message but it's muddied by some really uncomfortable scenes and questionable angles. If the director cut out a few angles and just shot them a bit more tastefully then I would think the film is way better but she didn't so it is what it is. However, I don't agree with the outrage that this film condones child pornography and the sexualization of children because clearly, it doesn't, the film depicts the mental toll it takes on the main character and it's not saying it is remotely cool or okay. The main character quite frankly is having a downward spiral and is completely lost on what do with her life, it's clearly showing that forcing children to be anything other than kids is a problem that needs to be addressed by traditional parents and parents that allow their kids to consume whatever. It's trying to be nuanced about a situation that is real and really fucked up, I have known many women to have grown up in traditional strict households to be some of the most broken, sexualized, and taken advantage of by older figures in higher positions of power, hey coach K, at like 13 or 14 years old. They would engage in this type of behavior and I know people don't like to think about it but it's reality. I'm not going to call the director a pedophile or anything absurd but I think she could have used some more second input on many shots but I think she tried her best and I can't condemn her telling her story. Overall it was a cool film with some great acting by the older and younger cast with a pretty important message weaved into the film. I hope this director is not ruined by this film because she has potential honestly.", "Does anyone honestly think the child actresses are ever going to regret being in this movie? \n\nI\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say no.", "90% critic's score. 6% audience score. All you need to know. They're trying to normalise this. It's disgusting. Hollywood is full of pedos.\n\n-\n\nVictimising children is bad! Lets victimise children to show how much its bad. Stupid filmmakers. Disgusting film. Leave kids alone.", "\\*MY ORIGINAL POST WAS REMOVED BECAUSE OF THE MODERATORS LIMITING NEWLY RELEASED FILMS, SO, HERE IT IS. The discussion, while brief, was very constructive.\n\nFirst of all, if you haven't actually watched the film, you can just stop reading now because your opinion is completely clouded - I know, because I was you, until last night. Based on the negative press surrounding the film and being a father of two daughters, I had no intention of watching it. However, my wife and my younger daughter had done their due diligence and insisted we watch it as a family.\n\nOkay. Yes, the seductive dance scenes are very uncomfortable to watch, but guess what? That's kind of the point. If the viewer isn't uncomfortable with it, then, well, yeah, you probably shouldn't be watching this and I'm hoping someone catches you before you molest someone. But here's the bigger issue... we are taught to objectify women very early. And it's not just little boys being bedazzled by advertising, little girls see it too - wrap your head around that for a minute. But I digress.\n\nNetflix really screwed up on two fronts with Cuties. First off, the marketing campaign was shit and I don't know how in the hell those decisions were approved. Secondly, the overdubbing in English was abhorrent. Seriously.\n\nSo, here's my thoughts on the film. It's a story about a girl, Amy, played brilliantly by Fathia Youssouf, moving into a housing project. She's pre-pubescent and comes from a strict Muslim household. So, depending on your background, some would consider her very oppressed. She is hazed by her new \"friends\" with a level of cruelty that is heartbreaking to any parent who has had a child bullied, but she is eventually accepted by her new friends and joins their dance group. At this point, she has found out her father is taking on a second wife (by listening in on a gut wrenching phone call her mother makes) and her entire world falls apart. She's just a normal kid with a huge amount of responsibility being the oldest child in the family. She is often left to take care of her kid brother (thinking he is around 5) and even younger toddler brother - but, no one's freaking out about how dangerous that scenario is. Anyhow, her new \"friends\" are preparing for this dance contest and they show Amy a video of the previous winners (a quartet of teenage girls who, well, are hyper-sexualized in the way they dress and dance). And guess what? Kids tend to look up to older kids... and so the cycle goes. The younger girls think the way to win is to be like their predecessors. Now, there are levels to how the dancing and even the dressing unfolds (it's a building process and has it's desired impact of uncomfortableness - but, it's also woven throughout an amazing coming of age story). Wanting to completely solidify her standing with her friends, Amy, who recently stole her father's phone, uses the phone to search the Internet for dancing ideas. What she comes across is, you guessed it, hyper-sexualized women, strippers, music videos, etc. - she takes this newfound goldmine of information and teaches her friends the \"new\" dances that will certainly get them the \"W\" at the dance contest. You can see where this is heading. Innocent girls with no adult supervision (but, let's be honest, you ever watched a pageant or dance contest that has adult supervision? Well, let's just say there's definitely a fine line that I think most already crossed, buy, yeah, what do I know). And, during all of this, she gets her first period and that becomes a whole other side note of how different cultures deal with that. Anyway, as her home life is completely falling apart over the traditional that the first wife's family has to help with the second wife's wedding (this part was so freaking heartbreaking to me), our young protagonist is desperately trying to fit in to this new school she's attending and be accepted by her new friends. She does some very questionable stuff (takes a selfie of her private parts) and posts it publicly, in a misguided effort to gain publicity for her dance team, only to be slut shamed by her dance team. The day of her father's wedding to his second wife is the same day as the dance contest, and forces (don't want to give away all the spoilers) her way back onto her team (they had kicked her off because of the controversial picture). The girls, in the outfits featured in the marketing poster, do their over sexualized dance to a mortified audience of parents who end up booing them. Amy has this come to Allah moment on stage and abruptly leaves and rekindles her relationship with her mother, who tells her she doesn't have to go to her father's wedding and she becomes a kid again.\n\nThere's a lot more nuances to the story and I'm just doing a mind-dump on some of the important points. So, here's my issue with people shitting on this film. It, in no way, is glorifying the sexualization of little girls. It was helmed by an African woman, Ma\u00efmouna Doucour\u00e9, who faced similar backlash as the protagonist coming to a new country as an immigrant (another issue touched on in the film). From an article in [Time](https://time.com/5886184/cuties-netflix-maimouna-doucoure/), she says, \u201cFor me, this film is sounding an alarm. This film tries to show that our children should have the time to be children, and we as adults should protect their innocence and keep them innocent as long as possible.\u201d And in a nutshell, that's what the film is about. And to all you high and mighty reactionaries screaming about how could they exploit these little girls in the film, well... let's have a real discussion about when you tell your kid Santa Clause and the Toothfairy aren't real. Going back to advertising and how women are objectified, the experience portrayed in this film, unfortunately, is very real for many little girls. They are exposed to all of this hyper-sexualization at a very young age. Don't kid yourself if you think all eleven year old girls dress up as princesses and sing \"Let it Go\" all day, every day. Most eleven year olds are in middle school, which means they're getting a healthy dose of what 13-year-olds are exposed to. When I was eleven, I tried to smoke cigarettes, drink beer and get laid - of course none of that happened, but I tried, is my bigger point, and this was pre-Internet. And by thirteen, I checked two of those experiences off my to-do list - how's that for reality? And, my experience wasn't unique.\n\nSo, finally, let's make some comparisons of this film to others... by the way, Fathia Youssouf's performance in this was absolutely amazing, reminiscent of Natalie Portman in L\u00e9on: The Professional (1994). Remember that film? Portman turned 12 while filming it. I just hope Youssouf's career takes off similar to Portman's because she is truly gifted. Jodie Foster was 12 when she portrayed a teenage prostitute in Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976). Nikki Reed was 13 when she co-wrote, 14 when she filmed Thirteen (2003). Evan Rachel Wood turned 15 when filming. Can anyone actually prove that Sarah Henderson was really 17 in the film Kids (1995). Remember the opening scene to that movie? The rest of the cast ranged from 12-19 and it received an NC-17 rating. And, if we're really gonna keep it real, let's talk about Dance Moms (which, surprisingly is on Lifetime and going into its 8th season) - ever see how those girls dress, how they dance?\n\nWatch the film. You're supposed to feel uncomfortable. Get over yourself.", "I saw it. The film was bad period. The plot was loose and had a lot of plot holes. The pedo scenes were 100% for shock value, but the director executed it horribly. Instead of creating discussion of the sexualization of children it instead gave pedos fapping material. As a grown man it disturbed me and I definitely had to turn away during some of the scenes. Its a bad movie period and I dont recommend anyone watch it.", "Hi everyone! I'm new to this subreddit. So please be kind in the comments. These are just my own opinions. I will respect your opinions as well if you do mine!\n\nSo, I see this Cuties movie ended up causing a lot of controversy, and rightfully so. \"Everyone\" wants to boycott Netflix and cancel their subscriptions etc... But where was the Boycott Lifetime - Dance Moms or TLC - Toddlers and Tiaras movements? Both shows are famous for either low-key or straightup exploiting and sexualizing underage little girls. \n\nIt was only a matter of time before someone made what I think is a necessary video juxtaposing clips from Dance Moms and other YouTube channels which feature underaged girls dancing in similarly inappropriate ways to how the actresses in cuties were made to dance in the movie. [ https://youtu.be/V362jwa0D5s ] \nYes, girls as young as like, 4 years old are shaking their asses and twerking, spreading their legs, smacking their asses, bending over, crawling on all fours. Somehow all of that wasn't a big deal, but Cuties is? Interesting. People are saying things like \"what's the big deal? They're just dancing\" or \"Anyone that makes a big deal about the movie is probably a you know what themselves and needs to get help. Chill out.\" I hate those kinds of comments. \n\nThe outrage to me is interesting, considering this has literally been going on for years and years and years, and now so many people are talking about it because of this one movie Cuties, which is great that people are talking about it, but yeesh, where has everyone been? It's been rampant everywhere. Too many movies and shows exploit and sexualize little girls, or children in general. It needs to stop for real. Cuties isn't even the worst out there I don't think... If you know of any worse movies out there let me know. Lolita comes to mind. I saw that movie years ago. I hear Kids and The Good Boys were pretty bad on this also.\n\nMa\u00efnouna Doucour\u00e9's may have had good intentions, and her heart may have been in the right place, but you don't go exploiting and sexualizing little girls in an attempt to make a point about how sexualizing children is wrong. That's like making a fictional movie called \"Cowspiracy\" and buying real animals and brutally abusing them on screen to make the point in your movie that Animal Agriculture is inhumane and wrong... You use real animals instead of using cgi or just sprinkling in real footage that's already out there from other documentaries or footage you documented yourself of the abuse in the industry. \n\nI think perhaps it would have been better if she just went and made a documentary called cuties, it would have been more effective in getting her point across and maybe there wouldn't be such backlash on her personally as a director but more so on the entertainment industries or other forms of social media which are guilty of doing what she was trying to fight against...\n\nWith Cuties, unfortunately Ma\u00efnouna Doucour\u00e9' became a part of the very problem she was trying to criticize and fight against due to poor direction decisions and editing and lack of awareness.\n\nNo one needed to see 2 minute montages of 11 year old girl's dancing in sexually suggestive ways while the camera zoomed in and out of their crotches and asses in order to know that that's wrong...\n\nAnyway, curious to know what Y'all think of my opinions. Thanks!

If you know any girl that was in a dance troupe as a child, I would not be surprised if they\u2019ve had an experience close to the ones shown in this movie.\n\nIf you\u2019re mad at what this movie shows, be mad at the industry at large. Be mad at shows like 16 & Pregnant and Dance Moms. Be mad at parents who see a young boy and a young girl talking and go \u201cOoooh they\u2019re in love\u201d, \u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d.

I agree with [this review](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cuties-movie-review-2020) for the most part.\n\nEspecially the closing statement.\n\n> Perhaps the most important message of \u201cCuties\u201d is that no matter what Amy says or does, she\u2019s still just an 11-year-old girl. People are quick to judge her for trying to act like an adult, but really, **all she wants is to feel cool and fit in**. She wants to be liked, and what person who survived middle school couldn\u2019t identify with that? She thought the way to do that was to emulate others.

Amy's family are strict Muslims, and we see early on how Amy chafes at the expectations put upon her by this upbringing. In an early scene, at what appears to be a religious gathering of women, we listen along with Amy as those gathered are warned about the importance of women remaining modest, and are told that hell will have many more women than men due to their failure to uphold that modesty. The woman leading the gathering talks about the importance of obeying one's husband, and how they must \"remain fearful\" of educating their children. It is at the end of this meeting that we see Amy display her first sign of rebelliousness: she steals some beads that someone leaves behind.\n\nAmy's father is absent, and her mother is vague when Amy asks when he is coming to join them. Later, while hiding, Amy overhears the truth: her father has taken a second wife, who he will soon bring to France with him. She listens as her mother (who still doesn't know Amy can hear her) tries to put on a brave front over the phone to an acquaintance while telling them the news, even as she breaks down in tears after hanging up. Amy, still hidden, must cry silently in sympathy with her mother.\n\nSoon, Amy meets a new \"cool\" group of kids from school, including Angelica, who lives in the same building as Amy. The girls have formed a dance troupe called \"Cuties\", and they hope to gain entry to an upcoming dance competition. Amy seems envious of the Cuties, who appear to spend their days having carefree fun with little or no supervision, while she is stuck at home helping to care for her brothers. She starts learning dance moves from salacious music videos. When the Cuties have a falling out with one of their members, Amy joins the crew without her mother's knowledge, the other girls being impressed with the moves she has learned from those videos. We don't learn much about the other girls' home lives other than Angelica, who has an antagonistic relationship with her older brother, and who rarely sees her parents due to their long work hours. Her parents, she tearfully tells Amy, have told her that she's a bad daughter.\n\nWhile the girls see themselves as being \"grown up\", they are reminded time and again that they are really just kids. Some boys they try flirting with reject them as being too young, and a boy who they are video chatting with gets angry when he sees Angelica on camera, telling her that she's just a kid and should be playing with dolls. There is a scene where the girls are dancing, and you can see that, in their minds, they are just like those beautiful women they see in music videos,. Cut to the reaction of the audience watching the dance: shocked disgust at the gyrating of the little girls.\n\nIn her escalating attempts to rebel against her conservative home life and fit in with her friends, and against the backdrop of the upcoming wedding of her father to his \"second wife\" (which Amy is expected to attend), Amy starts stealing, lying, and even fighting girls from a rival dance troupe. Eventually, her behavior starts to alienate not only her family, but even the very friends she is trying to impress.\n\nIn the end, Amy will have to decide the kind of person she wants to be. The movie ends on a sweet note, even if it does require a sudden turn that could have been handled better.\n\nMy one real problem is that there don't seem to be many real consequences when Amy does some things that, in the real world, would have had consequences beyond her mother chastising her about her behavior.\n\nOn a 1-10 scale, I'd probably give it a weak 8.\n\nEdited: Corrected a character's name.", "I thought it was a very smart coming of age story about sexuality being forced onto young women who aren't emotionally ready.\n\nBut I feel it failed as a film due to the inherent exploitation of the child actors. \n\nAlso the in universe creation of child porn on a family phone. \n\nAlso the attempted drowning.", "Would be better if some over 18 actress plays the role as a children like many high school movie.

This move had the guts to talk about it and I'm glad it's there.", "It's ironic that the hysteria about this movie (which actually critiques the sexualization of girls) is coming from a country that produces, well, [this.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/e5/97/d5e59711e296c84d92b154bd43c88ef9.gif)\n\nI also wonder where all this panic was when Good Boys, a movie in which 10 year-olds play around with dildos and anal beads, came out last year. That movie had a whole trailer based around the fact that the kids in the movie weren't old enough to see it in theaters.\n\nApparently Cuties was based on the director's own experiences growing up. Parts of it are uncomfortable to watch (and are framed as being uncomfortable - like in the dance scene everyone's up in arms about, the audience are disgusted). But based on my own experience I'd say it's a pretty accurate portrayal of growing up and encountering/mimicking sexualization before you really understand it. \n\nHell, when I was the same age as the girls in this movie the music being marketed and sold to us was stuff like Britney Spears dancing in a sexy schoolgirl outfit, or singing about how she's a \"Slave 4 U\" in \na bikini with a snake around her neck, and Christina Aguilera wearing crotchless chaps for the \"Dirrty\" music video. Don't hate on a movie for daring to acknowledge that kids copy the sexualized imagery they're constantly being bombarded with.\n\nEDIT: It actually looks like the costumes the girls wear in the final dance are based on costumes from an episode of [Dance Moms](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/e4/ac/e9e4ac75130fb5c1836d9de49fd21192.jpg). You know, that show that's been running for eight seasons.\n\nBut yeah, damn the degenerate French.", "I wish people would understand that there is a huge difference between what is portrayed in this film, and the fact that child actors recreated scenes similar.\n\nIn the protective environment of a movie set with the knowledge that the sexualisation of the characters is wrong, the dancing becomes non-sexualised and is not exploitative.", "Massive Spoilers\n\nThis is such an important film to be made, and the people who are hysterical need to either watch it, or rewatch it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thesis of the film is that traditional misogynist cultures are horrible for women, but modern hypersexualized culture is harmful for women too. The character's dress shows her journey from wearing a head scarf and being told that her father betraying his family by marrying a second wife is a totally cool thing to do, then she gets increasingly inappropriate in western overly sexualized clothing, and the film shows a happy ending of her wearing appropriate but modern clothing and playing a kid's game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe film contrasts childhood ignorance with preteen/teen exploration of sexuality. The girls are curious about their own bodies as well as that of guys, but are also ignorant kids, as shown by the scene with the condom. People need to know this is actually how young girls are, and that should guide how we parent and mentor them. Children should be taught accurate lessons about sexuality and have parents and trusted adults serve as role models, and not learn crazy bullshit from pop culture or peers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main character's relationship with her mother is really key to this film too. Her mom isn't a bad person, and genuinely cares about her daughter, but she's also busy with two younger kids, had just moved to a new country, and was suffering emotionally due to her husband. It's only in the last couple minutes of the film that she embraces her daughter, recognizes how hurt her daughter is, and then emotionally meets her needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs to the dancing, yes, it is highly inappropriate for children of that age, but that's literally the point. People should feel uncomfortable with children replicating dances that are clearly sexual, but the film is VERY obvious in demonstrating this is a bad thing, from the reaction of the main character, to the reaction of other kids, to the reaction of adults. No reasonable person could come across as seeing this as approval. But, on the other hand, it is realistic. Preteens / teens do copy mannerisms they see in the media to an extent, and while this shouldn't force people into some demeaning, unreasonable lock down, \"Only hymns allowed,\" it's worth having conversations, being a good role model, helping them choose peers, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis film inherently is uncomfortable, because discussing childhood sexuality is uncomfortable. But it's also important. Adults who care about children need to know that wanting to grow up too fast can happen, that sexual attraction to peers happens, etc. and again, be willing to teach, to emotionally engage with, and to be a good role model in their own lives. That not only protects kids from their own dumb mistakes, but also provides a bulwark against predators. A well educated girl from a stable, loving family is VASTLY less likely to be the victim of abuse than one who comes from a troubled home, or was never taught about her own body, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's so weird to me that people have worked themselves up into such a lather of a film whose message is that girls should not grow up too fast, and that requires that they have good role models and adults who care about them and validate their emotions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be honest, some of the criticism is coming from self-radicalized communities on the internet. One guy in this thread is a conspiracy nut, and they've worked themselves into a hysteria over imaginary child abuse, so a film that addresses teen sexuality is going to inherently trigger them.", "Disclaimer: I have not seen the film and as a result, my comments are obviously based off of hearsay. Apologies if I get anything wrong.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve read some reviews and have attempted to parse out good-faith and nuanced discourse on the film. I\u2019ve seen a lot of sentiments along the lines of \u201cdepiction does not equal endorsement,\u201d \u201cartistic intention is important,\u201d etc. and I generally agree with this type of ideology. Art criticism that fails to recognize these sentiments frequently makes for lousy art criticism. However, it seems that a lot of people in favor of this movie are also failing to reckon with some tough truths about this film. \n\nIf it\u2019s true that there are multiple instances where the camera lingers on overtly sexualized images of children\u2019s bodies, including in close-ups, then I don\u2019t understand how this film doesn\u2019t pose major issues around consent. I think I read these children are 11? If not, it appears they can\u2019t be much older than 12 or 13. Either way, these children are YOUNG and I fail to see how they are old enough to consent to being heavily-sexualized in a piece of art that is being mass-distributed. Obviously, this movie isn\u2019t doing anything that\u2019s against the law, otherwise I can\u2019t imagine Netflix would\u2019ve purchased it, but from my perspective this only highlights the limitations of the law as a moral compass. \n\nThink about it this way\u2014I believe I\u2019ve seen people mention how the film highlights that the young girls in the movie don\u2019t understand the sexualized nature of what they\u2019re doing in a mature and thoughtful way, they\u2019re just copying what they see all over popular culture. Okay, great, this sounds like totally valid social commentary. However, uhhhh, are these actresses not more or less the  same age as the characters? If you\u2019re making a movie that highlights how young children struggle to grasp the hyper-sexualized popular culture they consume in a mature and thoughtful way, then how can you possibly believe that they can consent to being used this way in the name of art and social commentary? By and large, they won\u2019t have the life experience, emotional maturity, or self-efficacy to properly weigh and make such a decision.\n\nI\u2019m all for nuance when it comes to art consumption and I do think there are a lot of people taking issue with this film who are completely failing to do that. Calling anyone who defends the film a pedo is stupid as hell. However, I really think defenders of the film need to grapple with what I outlined above, and that means going beyond broad platitudes like \u201cdepiction does not equal endorsement\u201d that do not come close to addressing the actual issue.", "This shit is so gross. I couldn't watch the whole thing.", "Just sitting back looking at this controversy like wtf.\n\nMake a movie about a clown splitting a naked women in half with a hacksaw and no one bats an eye.\n\nMake a movie warning about kids doing what kids are doing and the world loses its mind.", "One step closer to the normalization of pedophilia.

But i begin to be concerned about the movie, so i took a VPN and watch it on Netflix America, because here in france it's still in the movie theatre. \n\nWhat's make me want to make this post it's this post from a tweet from Mary Margaret Olohan wich i don't know anything about but she made a list so i wanted to first give another view on the list before talking about my review of the movie.\n\n1 Little Girls watching porn and discussing blowjobs : maybe it's an European thing but it exist, it was like that when i was young, we where all curious and bragging about sex and i was in a rural area, my wife is from Paris and it was worse. Pre teen talk about sex, even if they don't understand it and with internet it get worse.\n\n2 Littlegirl ask boy if they want to see her breath : the scene is more like that, the 5 girls are on chatroulette, and a boy olderthan them is on the other side with camera on, they don't. On girls is typing \"do you whant to see big boobs ?\" the other girls laugh at the audacity of the one who write, the boy blushing, then one girl who own the laptop put the camera on, and the boy see they are kids, and became made, and tell them to go away in a rude way, the most populare girl respond vividly and she is obviously upset, she throw the laptop, the girls are fighting over her reaction\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3 Little girl blowup a condom like a balloon : So this on i don't get the fuss because here the real scene : they hanging out, and one girl is blowing a condom she finds on the ground, and all the other girls are shoked in disgust, but the girl who blowup the condom clearly don't know what is for, the other girls tease her, and make fun of her telling her she's gonna have desease, etc, the girl try telling softly that she didn't knew about, then next scene the girls are in a bathroom and the wash vividly the girl mouth with soap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4: the litle girls dance for strangers and the camera zoom on her butt : I guess this is the scene from the laser tag, the girls enter the lasertag without paying and get caught, the guard stop them then, they try to get away with it, the threatening the guard if he call the police they will say he is a pedophile, so he calls a collegue to be witness, but at this moment they receive the new they are qualify, so they jump hystericaly from happiness, then the guard get madder, so they explain, and the heroine of the film start to do lassive dances and the seconde guard stare with envy as the first one is disgust by his collegue and the girl, and shout at them to get out, and get mad at his collegue. For the zoom part, i will talk about the way the director (an african woman) decide to film like the way the girls see themselve. So yes, we see her dance, and it's made to make the specator uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5 - Little girl watch videos of strippers to learn dance moves : yes that's the point of the movie, little girls doing what they shouldn't\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6 - Little girls pull down her pant and take picture of her crotch and post it online : At the beginning of the movie she stole the phone from her young uncle, this one find out and try to get it back, she fight for it, try to seduce him, and then try to hide in the bathroom, but in a moment when she know she have to go out sometime, and get back the phone, in a deseperate need to attrracte more attention, she took a photo of her vigina, post it, then give the phone back, the photo will have huge repercution in her school and at home with her mother and great aunt. It's not an action who is rewarded in the movie, like most people who didn't see the movie may think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7 Little gril Writhes dances on the floor wearing only soaking wet pantis and tank top : I guess we talk about the final dance scene : after she almost kill another preteen girl to get on stage(scene to show who she loose her mind for all this), they all dance in the contest, it's a local contest, it's not a huge crowd, and it's mostly mothers and few men, the mother and some men are disgusted, and shock, they are booing, few men clearly shady look with envy but almost all the specators are shoked by the dance moves, and are booing. Then with no warring the heroin stop and start to cry with heavy tears (the first scene of the movie) then she runs away to get back at her mother, the aunt want to punish her for her prostitute clothing, but her mother don't let them, they hug each other, because she see her daugther is in distress, she ask her to change and she tell her she don't have to go to the wedding of her father and his second wife. The girl at this moment decide to choose her childhood, it's show by the cloth on the bed, she left behind her dancing clothes and the wedding one and go outside in normal clothes to play jumprope with other girls from her age. So again, the behavior during the movie is NEVER rewarded. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now my critic : the movie realy depicting the oversexualisation of little girls and make the specator uneasy and disgusted on purpose. The young actress and the mother are formidable actors. The story is a story of a normal poor unpopular girl who is obsessed by a group of girl, never in the movie it said all the girls are like that it's explicitly show that they are just this one group in particular.\n\nFor the filming of the little girls, i understand why people are affraid the pedophile will use the image, but it was the desire of the african woman director to flim the girls as the thought about themselve, to show there confidence and there obssessions. \n\nI am not a pedophile so the scene make me unconfortable because they are clearly don't know what they are doing, and it's the point of the movie, this is the only critic i get, yes maybe she should have film in a more sober way but she wanted to make an impact. She wrote the movie from her own experiences.\n\nNow more of my gut talking : if you wan't to make a review of a movie, take time to realy watch the movie, it's just little girl, it's shoking but if you are not a pedophile it's not suppose to affect you. Taking scene out of context is dumb. Even taking a movie out of his context, maybe it's too french for you guys, because the critics here, especialy from feminist website, and journals, are goods.\n\nAll the beauty show putting childs in slut outfit on stage come from america and we saw them sinces ages, so why now begin to care ? \n\nAnd YES the netflix poster is the dumbest things ever.\n\nWatch it, from the begin to the end."], "num_comments": 2241, "year": "2020"}, {"title": "The Babysitter: Killer Queen", "comments": ["The best part was Max getting hyped as fuck over Cole losing his virginity.", "The movie is basically Bee shipping her two favorite charges together and that's hilarious", "The scene where Melanie kills her dad reminded me of Monty Python", "not as good as the first one.

Cole has somewhat gotten over his PTSD from the events of the first two movies and he has really fallen in love with Phoebe; so much so that he plans to propose to her at the end of the school year. In contrast, Pheobe is still kinda freaked out by the events of Killer Queen but she is seeming to get through it due to Cole's support. Everything seems relatively normal until Phoebe keeps on seeing Bee in random places(At the mall, the college hall, in her house etc). Cole tries to assure her by telling she disintegrated all those years ago and that they are safe. Then, poof! The cult (including Jimmy, Diego and Melanie) somehow return. Cole and Phoebe obviously get in defensive stances, worried that they will be sacrificed again. But surprisingly, the cult doesn't want to hurt them. In fact, Hell has changed them and they don't want anyone to go through the hell of being a cultist or a sacrifice. They inform Cole and Phoebe that the Book of Satan wasn't destroyed and it has somehow fallen into the wrong hands again.(Someone at the college has it)\nA new cult has risen and Cole/Pheobe and the original cult have to stop them.\n\nContinuing on the theme of hard work from Killer Queen, each cultist will realise that they didn't need a deal with the devil to achieve their dreams/wishes. John finds out he's funny, Max realizes he can just join the military to kill people(Would make for a good joke), Melanie and Cole make up etc. Unexpectedly, the cult and Cole/Phoebe start bonding.\n\nJust like in Killer Queen,\nBee makes a cameo at the end.

I think she wanted to have a billion fans because it could replace all the neglect and lack of love her father gave her.

Some joke attempts felt also a bit much but at the end of the day maybe it just didn't click for me.\n\nIt was still so much fun though, how it was even crazier than the first one, and the way Max is always proud of Cole is always hilarious.", "I\u2019m a little late to the party here but I thought it was...fine. I laughed at a good bit of the jokes, the gore was laughably fake but in a good way, and I thought it was well acted save for Bella Thorne. The dad sideplot was funny for a good bit but the continuous \u201cthe car is my baby\u201d joke and the weird scene with the cop just did not land. Samara Weaving is always a delight and getting her back was a very pleasant surprise even with that terrible wig. Hope she can come back for the third and we can get an actual definitive answer on her backstory.\n\nAs for the negatives, it\u2019s pretty clear they did not have a big budget. Like I said, the gore looks fake, which isn\u2019t a bad thing, but you can make a low budget movie look high budget when you\u2019re setting your movie in a suburb. Not so with a lake. I don\u2019t live in Illinois, but I don\u2019t think their climate is conducive to having a desert lake like that.\n\nIn my opinion the best scene from the first is when Cole and Melanie are hiding from Bee; there\u2019s some genuine suspense there that you don\u2019t often get in horror comedies. When Cole and Melanie kiss, you\u2019re happy, you\u2019re rooting for them to succeed. And then the second movie doesn\u2019t go anywhere with it. Cole and Melanie are still just friends, which is fine, but a slow burn romance or any type of payoff from that first movie is ruined. I like Phoebe and approve of her and Cole being together, but the whole Melanie turning evil is such a massive betrayal and a huge shift from the original and it is barely even addressed. Was there any inkling she wanted to be an influencer? Her dad sucked, we knew that, but is that really enough to turn her evil? Her personality shifted way too much for it to be believable. The best part of the first is that even though Bee was a terrifying cult leader, the movie humanized her. You cared for her. You could still see that she actually cared somewhat for Cole. In this, it just sort of had Melanie kill Boom Boom and any type of human traits she had went away as she turned into some mustache twirling caricature. It just seems like the fact that there are totally different writers from the first one reared its ugly head too much and there was way too much retconning of the original.\n\nIt also looks like Cole hasn\u2019t really grown as a character since the beginning of the first movie, he\u2019s still terrified of needles, still getting bullied, still dressing like a dork, still has zero confidence, still is too scared to drive. It cheapens the ending of the original, ruins any sense of triumph.\n\nIt may seem like I hate it, but all in all all I want from a movie like this is to be entertained. I was. I don\u2019t hate the dialogue as much as other people and for a film nerd like me all the references were fun, even if they were unrealistic for teenagers. But when were these movies ever going for realism?", "My only gripe and source of confusion is why would Melanie just agree with the devil's deal? If i remember the 1st movie well, she, little she, seemed to be generally kind and value Cole. Was that people change, Gen Z so starve for fame trope? Thats quite lame. I feel Melanie character was given injustice for shock value.\n\n\nI enjoyed it regardless and seeing our fave babysitter Bee and a little backstory was worth it. Samara was the main reason I got interested in the 1st movie.", "I\u2019m most movies, McG couldn\u2019t direct his way out of a ripped paper bag, but there is something about these two movies that just made them a blast to watch. \n\nI actually think I liked Killer Queen better than the first one as well, especially considering that the best character from the first one is absent for most of the runtime. \n\nI feel like the dialogue in Queen wasn\u2019t as cringe inducing as some of the dialogue in the first movie. I think that most of the cult characters were super unlikable in the first one, but I felt they were a lot funnier in this one. I almost want to see a Robbie Amell led spinoff where he isn\u2019t wearing a shirt for the entire runtime(for some reason). I also feel like Jenna Ortega is one breakout role away from being a huge star. She was awesome in this and she seems to be popping up more and more.", "I'll be frank, horror movies are horribly predictable to me. So that's why I love Horror-Comedies like \"The Dead Never Die\", \"Fright Night\", and the series \"Ash vs Evil Dead\". Now, \"The Dead Never Die\" is more along the lines of the newer age of Horror-Comedy where scenes get played with, tropes get roasted, and chaotic little absurdities just let you know the world isnt realistic, nor is it supposed to be taken seriously. Horror-Comedy is a genre that enjoys the die hard belovedness that comes from a cult classic B-movie status. So with these movies (especially McG joints) are you really expected to judge the movie on the grading scale of a AAA Oscar Nominee? \n\nNow, understanding McG is easy, he likes callbacks, references, and unconventional wordplay. Callbacks are easy things for the audience to remember themes and goals. When Cole's psychiatrist/school nurse tells him \"You gotta get laid\" and the solution to his whole problem is such. As well, I noticed he decided to imitate Edgar Wright with a packed soundtrack a la \"Baby Driver\". I'd consider it a sin if the music taste was incongruous, but it fit so I smirked and let it slide. \n\nNow for the Acting! Lead characters like Phoebe, Bee, and Cole were fantastic. Judah Lewis(Cole) played up his awkwardness just as well as someone who was a step away from being committed would, if not more. His quips and punch lines were delivered as though he felt the role and had fun with it, big points for that. While Bea's role (played by Samara Weaving) was mostly scenes fit for the meme, \"You son of a bitch, I'm in,\" her portrayal as an adult who had to make the hard choices and do horrible things for the people she loved, unknowingly bringing her two favorite people together. And Phoebe (Jenny Ortega), just as weird as Cole, but a rougher around the edges attitude. Her ability to laugh off a situation, endearingly bust Cole's chops, and peel those layers down to the soft and vulnerable person beneath that is really why I can't complain about the acting. The chemistry between the romantic leads is cute and very strong. As an aside, Max (Robbie Amell) is a phenomenal side character who enjoys encouraging his prey so the hunt becomes more interesting. When he finds out the whole plot is foiled by Cole and Phoebe \"dirty dancing\" in the bunker, he respects the leap Cole took and congratulates him as he burns up. A surprisingly wholesome end to a villain.\n\nIt's really easy to forget the true nature of comedy, to amuse and challenge logical thought. So the phrase, \"Don't take it too seriously\" is kinda the point. It's made to tell a funny story and question the sanity of the stiff-upper-lipped critics and their confusion over it. Don't try to compare it to anything just kick back and laugh, it's good for you.", "iam not even mad respect \n\nthat makes me laugh every time", "[deleted]", "I just finished both films back to back and I know the reviews didn't like it, but I had a lot of fun with these films. Campy, goofy, gory slasher films. Sure, they're not 10/10 cinema but it was absolutely worth the watch.", "I definitely loved the first one more but I also had fun watching this one tonight. I love the actress who plays Phoebe, saw her in You and was blown away by her talent and screen presence, so was happy to see her in a leading role in this. Bee\u2019s wig and contacts were absolutely terrible. Things that were confusing include the plot reveal at the end and also why does Illinois look like Utah in this movie? They had canyons and lakes and cliffs and desert. Sound mixing was also mediocre, kept having to adjust my volume based off of the scene, and I didn\u2019t particularly care for Phoebe & Melanie\u2019s video game style fight scene, or the odd Disco scene. Also was confused about why they chose to depict medications for mental health almost in a negative light (in my opinion) when they help a lot of people. Maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding the message with that. Overall some solid performances from the cast, great dialogue, and fun homages and tributes to horror & sci fi  thrown into the mix.", "I've never made a comment on Reddit before but all I know is the downfall of Melanie pissed me off. she was cole's rock and his protector in the first movie but now she doesn't even flinch at the thought of murdering him to be a social media influencer?? it makes no sense and it feels like such a cop-out. they literally took the only other surviving member (besides cole) from the first movie and made her an ACTUAL psychopath....it's such lazy writing and that's saying a lot considering I really did enjoy the first movie. and on top of that there's supposedly supposed to be a third movie....are they gonna make phoebe the villian in the next movie??? I loved the first movie but in the end the second movie just got on my nerves to be honest", "While the plot was.... weird, I think they still achieved what the original was all about.

Characters weren't as interesting except for robbie amelle. Coles character you expected to be badass cuz that's how the last developed him, but kind of falls back . Bee seems forced cuz she was the best part of the first, but mostly seems like an afterthought in this one that they wanted to go back to make everyone love her like at the beginning of the first. I agree with others that there were plot holes as well. \n\nI so wish the sequel could of lived up to the first,  but oh well life moves on.", "This movie was the most beautiful piece of shit I\u2019ve seen... I don\u2019t know if I can give a movie an F and an A+ at the same time but that\u2019s my rating.", "This flick was a mindless good time, and really hit the spot for me. \n\nhits all the horror sequel tropes you expect and want, while keeping things fresh.

Saw the first one last year so I had to check out the sequel. I was glad to see Samara Weaving come back too! She's a bigger star now, but she was nice enough to come back for the sequel.\n\nIdk why this movie even has a Rotten Tomatoes rating. It's not something to take seriously. Just a funny movie with a killer plot. Can't wait for the trilogy. \ud83d\ude02", "I didn\u2019t even know this movie was a thing until I saw it pop up on Netflix. I enjoyed the first one more but I also enjoyed this one a lot. Max was easily my favorite part with how he missed Cole and was excited for him to lose his virginity. My two major gripes with the movie were Melanie and the Bee twist. I just don\u2019t think Melanie was a good villain especially compared to Bee in the first one, and I wasn\u2019t a fan of how Bee was suddenly good. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible for Bee to change like she did I just felt it was very sudden without any build up. Again overall I enjoyed the movie and would definitely watch a third if it somehow happens.", "I loved it but I simply don\u2019t get Melanie\u2018s motivation and why she became part of the cult!

For some reason, they chose not to bring him back and instead let McG write alongside two unknowns, and the whole thing kind of feels like a retread of the original\u2019s voice that doesn\u2019t wholly understand it.

Took a little longer than it needed to get going but once it did I have no complaints.", "I liked it but it wasn't as good as the first one. \n\n* I'm in the minority that didn't even consider the possibility of Melanie being evil so that came as a shock to me which I both like and dislike. I liked that the movie did something (for me) unexpected but she was such a sweet girl so it was a bit of a shame to make her evil, especially since the old crew returned so she wasn't even really needed. \n\n* It was a bit weird seeing Melanie so sexualized too since in the first one she was just a kid. I'm not saying it is a bad thing however, she's an adult now (at least the actor) it's just kinda odd. \n\n* How did Cole even know about the redhead's journalistic aspirations? \n\n* First act of the movie was pretty weak, it wasn't until they got to the lake that the movie really started.\n\n* The whole blood cult/Bee thing was a bit convoluted and I'm not even sure I understood it all. Like what's up with the events of the first movie if Bee isn't evil? Was the entire first movie just some 5d chess to match Phoebe and Cole together? \n\n* Phoebe was a good addition. \n\nI'd be down for more of these even though I didn't love this one and I also am not sure how they'd continue the story.", "That eye brow that Samara Weaving does when they scream that she betrayed them......", "I'm totally invested in this story and universe now.

I like that it explains her being so different in the first few scenes, but it was just so cringe. I was really hoping for a brand new storyline. This was just a rehash of the first one, complete with recycled jokes. By the time Bella Thorne got shot in the boob again, I was rolling my eyes. \n\nSpeaking of Bella Thorne, I loved her! One of the highlights. Another one of which is Samara Weaving of course. Bumped my rating up a notch just for the ending. So they nailed that surprise. \n\nOverall, would make a good double feature with the first.

The second was literally \"let's do the first one again since the first movie was surprisingly good\".\n\nI wonder if the cast knew this was a blatant cash grab - a line in the movie is about how only four sequels have been better than the original film.

The humor was a lot more desperate to be current and the antagonists mostly redid the same shtick they did in the first movie.\n\nMy biggest grievance is the absolute assassination of Melanie's character, there really was no reason to make her a villain and it totally ruins the interactions in the first movie.\n\nAlso not a fan of a redemption for Bee, what made her fun was that she was a villain that actually cared about her victims, keep her like that. Would have loved to just see the sequel be her and her gang trying again and when they failed just being like \"See you in two more years Cole\"\n\nI will say though that it isn't a total loss.

All and all, pretty good. \n\nI was very interested to see how the second one would follow that up. I haven't brushed up on my Joseph Campbell.

So we can kind-of-sort-of replay the original. \nThis movie is still firmly rooted in the almost ADHD style of the original but has a lot less impact. The gore is almost all CGI. It's not nearly as charming or heartfelt as the original. I think it exemplifies classic horror - in that it's mostly schlock. But, you know, not enjoyable schlock. \n\nAlso felt entirely too long.

He imagines a dance number, accepts the Nobel prize while sweeping the stage, then sings a beautiful show number. \n\nHe thinks of committing suicide from hypothermia in his car, but then comes back after sleeping in the school and starts up his car to go home and start it all over again.", "I watched Tenet the other day and actually understood the plot so I was feeling pretty smart. Then I watched this and remembered I'm a fucking idiot. I still really liked it though.", "Why were all the title fonts so tiny? You trying to hurt my eyes Charlie?", "If anyone can explain to me what the ice-cream girl's line about the smell not being varnish means, it would be greatly appreciated. The whole sequence with her, and the apparent overlap between the Young Woman and Jake is what I'm struggling with the most rn", "\n\nTo me, the book and also the movie are about lost chances. \n\nHe lost the chance of talking to the \u201cYoung Woman\u201d. \nHe lost the chance to be a teacher and eventually became the janitor and stayed in that job, well, obviously until very old. \nIt seems to me that he also lost the opportunity to see his parents getting old and also lost the chance of supporting them when they needed him. That\u2019s speculation, because it\u2019s not really implied, maybe just a little when he\u2019s in his truck and remembers very briefly a scene with his parents. \n\nI don\u2019t think he has a disorder per se. It seems to me that he\u2019s just really lonely and everything happened in his head. That makes everything only worst and very, very, very depressing.", "I found this movie to be incredibly sad and heartbreaking. It\u2019s basically an old man both reflecting on his life but also bombarding his own thoughts with a made up fantasy. Jake is a sad, lonely janitor with nothing going for him and no one in his life. Everything happening in the movie is just him creating this fantasy life with a woman to help cope with himself. She\u2019s the only thing keeping him alive, and her reflections on their relationship is basically his own self-reflections on his life. Shes starting to not see any reason to stay with him, and that\u2019s basically just Jake not seeing any reason to continue living. The scene close to the end with the girl speaking to the janitor about how she didn\u2019t remember the guy from the bar and how he was basically just a mosquito was Jake throwing out his last shred of self-worth. When she hugged him and left, he was recognizing her for what she was, a fantasy. The only thing that was left was to end things (his own life).\n\n\nThe saddest scene in my opinion was the janitor sitting there alone watching that lame romantic film, because it\u2019s basically just fuel for his continued fantasies, hence the actress in the fake movie briefly replacing Jessie\u2019s character in one scene. To anyone who\u2019s been in a real relationship, that film clip came off as corny and dumb, but to Jake it\u2019s something he admired and craved (hence the actresses appearance in his own fantasy). I kind of compare that to how certain people interpret \u201c500 Days of Summer\u201d *very* differently.\n\n\nI also think that whole scene with the father talking to the woman about paintings and how literal he needs them to be was Kaufman taking the piss out of the audience.", "I haven't been able to stop thinking of this movie.\n\nSpoilers ahead:\n\nI never read the book, so I have no other context other than the movie, but I think it became clear towards the end that that everything outside of the some of the scenes with the Janitor are the complete fantasy of the Janitor himself, who is in fact Jake at an older age. Apologies if this is obvious to most people.\n\nThe Janitor's life is shown in a few quick snapshots. We see that he is aged. We see that he lives alone. We see that he works as a janitor at a High School where the students don't respect him, make fun of him, or are creeped out by him. He is not living a satisfying life, and as his life approaches its end, it becomes clear to him that there is little he can do change things.\n\nInstead of trying to change things, he does what he has probably done for most of his life, which is to use fantasy to try to construct a potentially better life. It is hinted at in dialogue that Jake/the Janitor has probably been lonely and socially awkward for most of their life. His mother says that he never had many friends in childhood or adulthood, and it seems clear that he is not comfortable around people.\n\nThis brings us to his fixation on the Young Woman, sometimes called Lucy or Louisa or Lucille. I think that a portion of the story that she tells about their first meeting at the dinner table is accurate. It is likely that Jake did go to a a trivia night and did see the young woman and maybe even exchanged a few words with her. I doubt there was anything beyond this, but it was enough to begin a fixation within Jake. He probably first admonished himself for not asking for her number. This grew into something more and at some point in his life, he began to think of this moment as the last time he could have done something in order to have a happy life. If he had just asked for her number, or if she had asked for his, everything could be different.\n\nEverything we see of the Young Woman and Jake's relationship in the movie is Jake creating elaborate fantasies about how the relationship could have worked out. This accounts the various changes in the Young Woman's character throughout the movie. He always fantasizes that she is intelligent and creative. Sometimes this means that she is a poet, sometimes a painter, sometimes a physicist, but she is always idealized in some way. In a monologue near the end, the Young Woman addresses this. In the fantasy Jake is always smarter than he is, and the Young Woman is always perfect, not necessarily because he wants her to be perfect, but because he wants her to be respected, which in turn would bestow respect on him, something he dearly desires.\n\nIt also accounts for the name changes. He never actually got the Young Woman's name so it changes throughout the movie and as his fantasy develops. It also indicates how little Jake actually knows about the woman he has constructed his fantasies around. She is a complete blank slate that any characteristics can be applied to.\n\nI think it's interesting that even deep within Jake's fantasies, the relationship is still imperfect. He imagines fights and even that the Young Woman may not want to be in a relationship with him at all. This is likely the insecurities, depression, and anxiety that have plagued Jake for all of his life coming through in his fantasies. He is a person who feels unworthy of other people's love and affection, and it is likely these feelings that have stunted all of his relationships throughout his life. Even attempting to create a fantasy in which he is happy is difficult for him to do.\n\nThroughout the movie the phrase \"I'm thinking of ending things\" is thought by the Young Woman in reference to their relationship. At the end this takes on a new meaning, of Jake/the Janitor ending their life. I think it is very likely that he does in fact do this at the end of the movie, ending his unhappiness and regrets.\n\nWhat I'm less certain about is what the overall theme of the movie is. It could be about missed opportunities, but I think that's too simple. There is no indication that had Jake actually asked for the Young Woman's number that his life would have been any different, or that he would have somehow been saved from a life of unhappiness.\n\nI think more generally it is about allowing depression and anxiety to take control of your life, which in turn makes life unfulfilling and full of regret.\n\nThis is a deeply sad movie and the Janitor is a truly tragic figure. Unfortunately I think there are far more people like the Janitor than we realize. People who suffer inside of their own heads day in and day out while never letting anybody else in.", "I really hated all the changes they made from the book. \n\nThey made the protagonist one of the many oddities in the movie instead of the book which made her a normal character reacting normally to all this strange shit going on around her. We think she\u2019s a real person and that this is really happening, in this film it\u2019s pretty clear halfway through that this is either some warped dream world, or that she\u2019s not real. We the audience cannot relate to her or feel scared for her in the film, as she\u2019s just another piece of symbolism. She was the only normal person in the book, and thus she acted as a conduit for us into this strange world, because she felt like a genuine person. \n\nThey sort of abandoned the slow build up of pure dread the book gave you. In fact, they basically took most if not all of the scary parts out. The phone calls she receives are a big deal in the book and scary as fuck. The girl at the ice cream stand with the rash is creepier because you believe her when she says they\u2019re in danger, you have no idea this woman is just a piece of symbolism, you think she\u2019s an actual person actually living this. In the book when they\u2019re in the car and he sees someone watching them, it\u2019s really fucking creepy and unsettling, because these felt like real people in the real world who were in danger. Knowing that it\u2019s all symbolic and not real halfway through just abandoned that sense of dread and fear the book built. It\u2019s pretty clear he had no interest in adapting the scary sections, which is depressing because they\u2019re SO creepy in the book. \n\nUp until the very last pages in the book are you convinced that all of this is really happening, in the movie you sort of realize halfway through that it\u2019s all mostly imagery and symbolism, and that most if not all of it isn\u2019t actually happening. I have no idea why Kaufman sort of gave up halfway through in trying to convince the audience that this is all real, and sort of just shrugs and says \u2018yeah, it\u2019s all symbolic and/or not happening the way it looks\u2019, as evident when Jesse Buckley sees her poem in one of the books in the house and sees the parents aging 30 years within segments and shrugs it off like it\u2019s nothing. It makes her less relatable and makes the situation less creepy when they\u2019re basically telling you she\u2019s not a real person from the start. As someone else here said, it loses all sense of stakes and danger. \n\nIt\u2019s clear Charlie Kaufman didn\u2019t want to make something that was scary or dread inducing and instead wanted to make something more strange and symbolic. Which is fine, I\u2019d just probably like it better if it was closer to the book in that regard. Maybe if I hadn\u2019t read the book and expected the same horror and dread I\u2019d have liked the movie more. It\u2019s not terrible just not great imo", "Her poem was absolutely hilarious IMO..\n\nIt's like \"ahh I'm kinda a poet\" he's like let's hear the new one! \"Nah!\" Come on let's hear it!\n\nThen she goes into this shockingly devastatingly depressing poem that goes on fucking FOREVER and somehow just keeps getting darker lol that was amazing", "This really hit me hard. I'm not sure if what I'll describe below was the precise intention of the movie, but the film reminds me of how I used to exist in the world when I was younger. Getting over this type of thinking was basically the most important feature of becoming an adult for me, as well as escaping from frequent anxiety I felt when I was younger.\n\nUp until around my early/mid-20s, I basically performed my life for an imagined audience. I didn't think of it in this way until I started recognizing it and trying to force myself to stop doing it so much. It sounds cheesy, but I had to force myself to \"live for myself\" in order to stop being anxious all the time and feel comfortable enough to pursue what I wanted to do in life. The first time I noticed it was when I studied abroad in Argentina in college, and I was going to fly from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia (southern tip) and backpack toward BA for two weeks with my roommate from the US. My roommate canceled last minute, so I had to decide whether I would fly to Ushuaia alone or also cancel. I couldn't explain to him why I was so anxious to go alone. After a few days of backpacking alone and feeling very eerily \"alone for the first time ever\", I kept noticing that I was behaving as if people I knew were watching me, even though, I literally knew zero people for 1,000 miles in any direction. It was the first time I was not with someone I knew for more than a day or two, and I was surprised that I was still inventing or imagining the people in my life to watch me in order to judge whether my actions were worthwhile or not. It's not like I literally imagined them, but I non-linguistically sort of guessed what \"my people\" would think about everything I did or thought. Actually being alone gave me a lot of anxiety at first, because I kept feeling like \"what the hell am I doing?\". But after a while I realized that the source of that feeling was stemming from my interpretation of my life through an imagined \"my people\". I didn't notice it until I was actually alone and could separate actual people from this imagined version that I used to harshly judge myself. I think doing this is inherently human, and nobody gets over it all the way. But I did it way too much, and the shock of being totally alone at the southern tip of Argentina was what allowed me to identify it and start to work it out of my system over the following years.  \n\n\nThis process of imagining some observer in order to interpret oneself to judge oneself is how I understood the film until I read some articles after. The \"my people\" I passively imagined were a sort of \"normal people soup\" that my brain came up with from popular or likable classmates (especially women), as well as characters from books and movies. I felt like the young woman was basically an imagined person that the young man was using to assess his life in order to determine whether he should kill himself. I recognized the negative self-judgement through the imagined eyes of others as something I did to a great degree when I was younger. I think if I hadn't started working on it I might have ended up being an unhappy person like the main character.  \n\n\n(I apologize if this comes off as a humble brag that I traveled in Argentina. I imagine the realization could come without access to privileged and bourgie experiences, but that's how it happened for me. I hope this post might help someone who needs to do so come to the realization I came to, actually.)", "Hi I have a few questions first of all what the fuck", "It seems a lot of what happened was lost on me and I didn't really enjoy it. This [article](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/09/im-thinking-of-ending-things-ending-explained-book-oklahoma) did a good job of explaining what was going on and gave me some appreciation of it. I liked some things about it but by the end just found it confusing and unpleasant.", "Chiming in about the references to Oklahoma the musical, for those who aren\u2019t familiar. Spoiler alert. I\u2019ve read the book so some of this might not make sense if you\u2019ve only seen the film.\n\nYou may want to do a quick review of the [Oklahoma Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma!_(1955_film)) if you\u2019re unfamiliar.\n\nThe song that plays on the car radio in the beginning scenes is [Many a New Day](https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-many-a-new-day-lyrics), sung by the main female protagonist Laurey. It\u2019s a song about unrequited love - Laurey has been falling for the male protagonist Curly, but catches herself when she sees him flirting with another woman. She tells herself she doesn\u2019t need him, there are other fish in the sea, but it\u2019s kind of obvious that she still has feelings for him. (One of the other fish in the sea is Jud, a farmhand who\u2019s interested in Laurey. Laurey doesn\u2019t reciprocate Jud\u2019s feelings - he\u2019s a bit obsessed with her and is portrayed as lowly, dirty, and immoral. Jud asks Laurey to go to a dance with him and Laurey agrees, mostly to be polite but also to spite Curly. More on this later.)\n\nIn later scenes in the film, the play being rehearsed while the janitor is cleaning the auditorium is Oklahoma - same for the two dancers practicing in the hallway as the janitor walks by. \n\nNow for the ballet: when the girlfriend finally finds Jake in the hallway in the school, their doubles walk into the scene and begin the ballet. This scene is a replica of the [Dream Ballet](https://youtu.be/2D1loAVwiMc) sequence in Oklahoma. It\u2019s a really dark scene, especially for a musical. The dry farm atmosphere in the musical\u2019s ballet contrasts really nicely with the snow falling in the gym in the film. If you haven\u2019t seen it, I highly recommend watching that clip - it\u2019s eerie how closely they replicated the choreography in the film. Even the veil falling down on the girlfriend\u2019s head. \n\nIn the ballet in the musical, Laurey dreams about marrying Curly, but Jud arrives and disrupts the wedding. Jud ends up killing Curly, and he stalks off with Laurey thrown over his shoulders - i.e. an extremely possessive gesture. (As many have commented, there are many other references to men possessing women/women as property of men throughout this film. The argument about Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside, for instance.)\n\nIn the film, the girlfriend\u2018a doppelg\u00e4nger/dancer is Laurey (the heroine), dancer Jake=Curly (the hero) and dancer janitor=Jud (villain). The ballet scene (kind of?) acts as a supplement for the final scenes in the book. /// Spoiler alert for the book /// Dancer janitor kills dancer Jake, and if the janitor is interpreted to be an older version (or alter ego) of Jake, this scene essentially shows Jake killing himself. \n\nThen the final scene of the film shows Jake singing [Lonely Room](https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-lonely-room-lyrics) from the staged musical. The lyrics here are pretty clearly interpreted, but there\u2019s one additional song from the musical (not mentioned in this film) that is interesting to look at through the lens of the film. \n\nIt\u2019s a song called Poor Jud is Dead ([clip from the 1955 film](https://youtu.be/Euq8Z4l6Iwk), and [lyrics if you just want to read them](https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-pore-jud-is-daid-lyrics)). It\u2019s a pretty messed up message- basically Curly tried to talk Jud into killing himself - under the guise of \u201cI\u2019ll show them / they\u2019ll all be sorry when I\u2019m dead.\u201d As soon as I saw the ballet scene in the film, I immediately thought of this song. If we continue on with the film\u2019s insinuation and view Curly as Jake and Jud as the janitor, it\u2019s basically an off-camera allusion to Jake trying to convince himself to kill himself (\u201cwhat are you waiting for?\u201d)\n\n(The musical ends with Curly killing Jud to protect Laurey, and to assert male dominance/stake claim to his wife i.e. property. The film adheres to the bizzaro world ending of the dream ballet rather than the actual end of the musical.)\n\nIt\u2019s actually a pretty brilliant connection Kaufman has made. I hope some of this made sense - I figured much of this would be lost on those who aren\u2019t familiar with the musical.", "The part where the mom says something along the lines of, \u201cyou had no friends on your 50th birthday- sorry 20th birthday\u201d showed how disappointed and how much she wanted her son to have more meaningful connections.", "I think some movies just aren't made for me, and this is one of them. I don't think it was bad, all the performances were good, visuals were beautiful, and I loved the theme of time and how it washes through people. I think I would've liked it more had I been more interested in trying to figure it all out from the get-go, but I did find myself pretty bored for most of it once I realized this was just gonna stay pretty bizarre throughout. \n\nI like the idea that the woman is just imagined by Jake and he's just placing her in different situations in his life like a science experiment, imagining how his parents would act, what they would talk about on the drive, etc. Explains her clothes and what she's studying changing constantly, as well as how he can seemingly read her thoughts and always conveniently interrupts her as she's about to say \"I'm thinking of ending things.\". As it all goes wild in the end, it's as if his idealization is crashing down on itself as he follows it to its logical conclusion. Does that make any sense or am I just being deliberately obtuse? I don't know.\n\nI'm not a huge film buff, and the only other movie of Kaufman's that I've seen is Being John Malkovich (which I loved), so I just felt pretty outta my depth watching this. I think this is one of those movies where my opinion reflects more on me than the quality of the movie itself, just not my thing. Honestly as I was writing this I realized that this movie is more fun to think about than to actually watch, imho.", "This movie is GENUS", "A few days late watching it, but my girlfriend and I just finished it and here's our take. Neither of us have read the book. \n\nWe got the vibe that he's a sad, lonely, creepy old man, and the events in the film were in his mind while he sits in his truck poisoning himself via the fumes from his exhaust. The fantasy changes time period a lot, and her name and job change too, likely because of the fumes. Smell is mentioned twice (the dog and the varnish). And what solidified this for us were the voice messages she received from him, not lucid, in his truck. He's calling a girl who timidly gave him her number because she doesn't know how to say no. \n\nUnrelated to the above, but I also noticed that he told his dad that he had snow chains in \"the bed\", but he drove there in a car.

At the time it's like \"Oh, she's putting on her snooty critic hat\", but afterwards you realize he read a review once that trashed a movie he liked and it's been eating him up ever since", "Im bad at reddit and don\u2019t know how to mark spoilers on mobile so here\u2019s my *SPOILER WARNING* for the movie AND the book. I\u2019m having a really hard time separating the film from the book and wish I was able to momentarily erase my memory of the book so I could experience the film with no preconceived expectations. I overall did like the movie, in fact, I thought Kaufman was really nailing the tone up until the school. I was fully ready for him to go into the dread inducing horror of the book, the girlfriend being stalked by the janitor, finding clues of Jake\u2019s disappearance and slowly working up to the suicidal revelation that everything happening in the story thus far is in Jake\u2019s mind, including the murder (which is actually suicide). It was my favorite part of the book probably. What we got instead was an interpretive dance sequence. It just didn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m going to copy something I posted in a different thread here, and would love to have a discussion with both book readers and non book readers.\n\n\n\nIt felt like from there Kaufman kinda shyed away from going as horror as the book does. From my understanding, the interpretative dance scene is Jake/Janitor playing out in his head what would have happened (essentially what does happen in the book?) their courtship, marriage, and eventual death at his own hands (janitor stabbing Jake in the dance) But then, does the janitor go out to his car and die from hypothermia? Everything after that with the pig is him on his way to the afterlife, with the stage performance by Jake being him reflecting on his life and all the players in it before finally passing on.\n\nThis is my interpretation, would love to hear others.", "I really loved this movie.  \nThe way they represent the internal dialog/fantasies this ordinary man creates to avoid contemplating (or finally commit) suicide is heart breaking. Love how the quirk and close to nonsense dialog and behavior at the beginning becomes so dark and charge with emotion at the end (let alone after a second view). Same goes to the performances.\n\nThe final moments of the film where his fantasies turn into delirium due to the hypothermia, and he has this hallucination with the pig, which tell him that basically he got to be one them, one of those who die and lived alone with no one aware of his suffering, just like the pigs eaten alive by maggots due to abandon... Man, if that isn't an existential tragedy!\n\nCharlie Kaufmann is such an original and genuine writer. Those doubts, fears and fantasies are so elemental and universal (at the end, must of us are going to be one of the pigs). The representation of this struggle, of the fantasies we create to ourselves in order to accept our existence is devastating. \n\nIn the final frame of the movie they let us answer the aforementioned question: how a painting  can be sad with nobody looking sad in it? Well, like the young woman said at one point: it is sad if you imagine yourself in it. Genius.  \n\n\n10-10", "I feel like a lot of these comments are too caught up trying to rationalize this movie, assigning roles to the characters and searching out specific meanings for every little thing.\n\nI'm not saying meanings aren't there and you can't interpret things, but I think it's important to watch these types of movies more emotionally or viscerally and not worry about \"getting it\" because if you're doing that you can't slow down and might actually miss the ride.  If you chill and allow your subconscious to connect I think you'll find you 'get it' in the moment and its not trying to be crazy intellectual.\n\nThe experience is in the pacing, the anxiety, the confusion, losing your direction and fighting to stay on track, boredom, seeing horror in something that's supposed to be 'normal', having strange conversations where you can't believe what an asshole you sound like, weird ticks, fearing and wondering what's beneath the surface of the people around you, nostalgia for the past, fear of the future and of death, feeling worthless and wanting approval, feeling like your best days are gone, its all part of the unedited human experience that I think Kauffman is more interested in capturing here than a hard narrative.", "The dinner scene from Eraserhead now has some serious competition for the awkwardness high score.", "Was there a brief point in the car when they are driving where another actress replaces Jessie Buckley?

A lot of the stuff actually just about not knowing another person truthfully and not being able to ever certify that knowledge of someone is just a super painful concept to me at the moment.

There was a moment in the second car journey where Lucy kept making raspberry noises and jerking her hands toward her face and it made me so uncomfortable given the end of the book.

Anyway, I wondered if anyone else flinched at those raspberries or if I'm still disturbed from reading the book a couple weeks ago. Sorry, *several* weeks ago.", ">!I don't know if anyone has made this connection yet, but when the imagined girlfriend is in the car after young Jake has left to go inside the high school, she waits and waits and begins to get colder and colder, she says that hypothermia is not that bad of a way to go out, I see this as Jake seeing that as his way to commit suicide as it is somewhat painless.

It was still very good- extremely well-acted all around, and creepy/scary without relying on all the old cliches of horror movies- but it was an unexpected bummer. \n\nI still liked it and I would still recommend it if you\u2019re in the mood for a real weird one, but still. Not like a real uplifting ride.", "Different people will have different interpretations of the final third of the movie, so what did *you* think of the high school part?

The big tip off she wasn't real for me was that she never knew anything he didn't- he was always able to pick up and add to her references. There's definitely some self-conscious reflection going on here on Kaufman's part about how men write women.

He goes to the ice cream place for both nostalgia, and because he likes to flirt with the staff. He is slowly realizing that they no longer find him cute, he is a creepy old man. \n\nThe ballet sequence is taken from the finale of the first act of Oklahoma! Basically, in the play, Laurey is in love with Curly, but Jud, a large, simple, and angry man wants Laurey for himself. He is willing to attempt to take her by force. The first act ends with a nightmare ballet in which she is dancing with Curly and is about to marry him when Jud enters and kills Curly. In I'm Thinking of Ending Things, he sees himself as Jud, the one who has barged into these women's lives. \n\nIt ends with him imagining that he's a brilliant physicist accepting an award ala A Beautiful Mind. In having everyone in clear stage make-up, I think it's him realizing it's only ever going to be a fantasy. He then sings Jud's song \"Lonely Room\" accepting that he is, in fact, the villain.\n\nThis is of course my subjective opinion. I really enjoyed the whole thing overall and I want to watch it again!", "Did anybody else get a serial-killery vibe from Jake when he drives down that road and she didn't want him to? He beats the wheel hard. And then she gets out of the car and the big trash can is full of ice cream cups? Like he has done that before, many times, taking women to an isolated place to murder them or something?\n\nMaybe that's Kaufman just playing tricks on me.\n\nI would have checked that first trash can, though.", "This is a late comment. I really love this movie, just want to add my own mental notes on top of everything that's been said:\n\n1) The way the movie progressed is like sleep to me, like the beginning car ride in winter lulled me into a relaxed state and then the REM stage and full on dream logic commenced. Also some elements jumped out to me like wanting very much to go somewhere or being late for somewhere and being constantly prevented (Lucy wanting to go home). Like, Ive had this kind of dream before\n\n2) at the beginning, they were talking about writing and Jake said he was writing about this woman named Lucy who was beautiful and ideal\n\n3) bonedog, the lines about going home  moon-landed and having special powers. The janitor was frustrated about not achieving more in life or being tied down by his farm life because he has full knowledge of what is out there, that there was more to life he missed out on. Jake even commented that it was like it was written about him. Really sad, really relatable\n\n4) while watching it for the first time with no prior research done, I slowly realized it was happening in *a* mind, but it only dawned on me later on whose mind it was. It was *a* mind to me because the people would often talk in a similar way without reason, using the same words and phrases (for some reason some words standout sometimes like Treacherous use din different instances)", "This movie reminded me of the stages of Alzheimer\u2019s", "I've seen some theories about the dance scene and the knife fight. My interpretation is that both the good looking Jake and the Janitor are both himself. The whole thing is about him thinking about missed opportunities. The good looking Jake is who he thinks he should have been but the Janitor is who he became. So the Janitor is the one who wins the \"fight\" and good looking Jake dies. Just had this on my mind, dunno if it's been posted.", "I don't usually post about movies, but I felt so confused and ultimately hilariously frustratingly dissapointed by this film I had to post\n\nWtf was this crap... I got vibes early on it was just being weird for the sake of weird and some people will come out with you just don't get it\n\nThis film is basically just several random weird scenes mashed together in between long boring scenes of dialogue\n\nYou will find yourself trying to guess what's going on throughout the movie only to realise your going to have to wait untill the end only to get no real explanation leaving you frustrated and confused to what was the point of the movie\n\nP. S it wouldn't surprise me if certain kind of people will make out its some masterpiece.. Making out that others aren't smart enough to get its deep thought provoking meaning lmao... Reminds me of when some oddball weirdo paints something that looks like a toddler did it and certain folk try to make out its a masterpiece", "First off, the Directed by Robert Zemeckis got probably the biggest laugh I'll conjure for a movie this year. \n\nMan, this movie is a fuckin trip. I expected nothing less from Kaufman but even with Synecdoche being one of my top five movies this still unsettled me and took me by surprise in a big way. \n\nI think what's different is that while Synecdoche gets into the weirdness right away and tells you up front you're in for some shit, this movie almost feels like a normal movie for the first 40 minutes or so. There's a 20 minutes dialogue scene in the car to start it off and even though there's some oddities like Jake seemingly stepping on the toes of her thoughts, this could easily be like any other relationship drama up until after dinner. I felt it was much more unsettling when things started getting weird later because we'd been introduced to this relatively normal story up until then. \n\nEnter David Thewlis and Toni Collette, the real gems of this movie. I loved everyone involved but their portrayal was \"universal in the intimate\" for me. Really felt like we were dealing with an old and isolated couple. They got a chance to shine in that dinner scene and even moreso once the rapid aging/de-aging sets in. \n\nOverall, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this movie. The themes are strong and the reveals are interesting, but it's definitely going to take a few watches to get everything out of it and I'm looking forward to it. On a single watch I got the idea that a lot of this revolved around Jake more than the girl. \n\nIt seemed like this movie was exploring two or more possible timelines at once. One in which they are in a relationship but she is thinking of leaving all the time, and one in which they maybe never dated, like she said when she spoke to the janitor that describing him would be like describing a mosquito that once bit her, and he is a janitor in his old age who is mocked by the kids and watching dumb love stories in his spare time. Each one revolved more around Jake's insecurity so while she was the center of the movie I have a feeling he was the one at the real focus. \n\nThere are lots of clues and I'm not sure what to make of them yet. She seemed to be studying everything depending on the scene. Ageism, art, poetry, genetics. They each fit the theme but I think this works towards the idea that she is more of a creation of his, flowing in and out of professions as needed for his ideal girlfriend. Similar to how her name is a little fluid, the specifics seem to change a lot. This kind of tells me that they may have never even dated and a lot of this movie is a hallucination or creation of a sad and lonely man. In that way it reminded me of Synecdoche, how the whole thing can be seen as a tale of regret. \n\nThis could arguably be reinforced by the stage performance at the end. He was putting on a show for the people and even the people watching were obviously fake shown by the stage aged makeup. He's entertaining himself and dreaming of the glory of appreciation. At least that's how I read it. \n\nIt's hard to say for sure. This movie oddly felt more straightforward than Synecdoche or Anomalisa, but I think after watching it is actually much less so. Those movies are odd but their plots are very straightforward and in the present whereas this movie feels very abstract. I'm excited to read some interpretations in this thread, that's for sure. \n\nI'm feeling a solid 7/10 on this one. I think the step more towards the abstract was an iffy move for Kaufman, as if his movies aren't already abstract enough. BUT I am excited to rewatch this down the line and I can only see that score going up once I do.\n\nEdit: worth mentioning that the song Jake sings at the end is called Lonely Room and it's from Oklahoma! It's a song where the antagonist of the show, who's main motivation is that he wants the woman that is in love with the protagonist, sings about how lonely he is and how much he thinks about having her.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "The entire time Lucy was talking, I always thought he could hear her somehow. Its apparent now that those are his thoughts. Another detail is that there are lot of continuity errors, such as characters switching clothes, and I acknowledged how a phenomenal filmmaker like Kaufman wouldn\u2019t do something like that on accident. I feel like it\u2019s pretty easy to pick up on the fact it\u2019s all a dream, but the specifics are pretty hard to connect the dots on.", "Finally watched it last night with no background info or context (haven't read the book and I didn't read any reviews or watch the trailer).\n\nI enjoyed it, but I can also see why its audience rating on RT is 49% last I checked. It's like weirdo prog rock or surrealist art/literature. Not for everyone, and I don't mean that in a condescending \"if you didn't like this then you didn't *understand* it\" sort of way.\n\nThe movie is far more concerned with exploring moods/characters/ideas than providing consistent entertainment value, and that's not going to click for everyone. It reminds me of David Lynch's stuff or maybe something like Enter The Void (the latter of which I did *not* like). \n\nAt its core it's really just a character study of one man's mediocrity, regret, and collapsed ambition. One of the criticisms I'm seeing in the comments is that there's no cohesive point and I don't think I perceived one exact central message on first viewing, but it created a sensation similar to a child lifting up a rock to see what kind of strange critters are crawling beneath the surface, except in this case Jake is the rock. Over the course of the film his life is laid bare and you can maybe connect with some of the lessons, experiences, and mistakes.", "I know the janitor ending is supposed to be the explanation but I think:\n\nThe story she tells at dinner is true, they did have an interaction at trivia night or a bar but she got a call from her friend and went outside to take it or that friend played some role in intimidating him. He never got her number and they never started dating.\n\nEven though she\u2019s the narrator and we hear her internal monologue the movie is actually from Jake\u2019s perspective. Her paintings turn out to be the work of a  painter he idolized. She is an imagined version of what he thinks a relationship could have been like. Shea great painter and poet and scientist and he is stuck on his own shortcomings and imagining how she would never accept him or his family with all of their quirks and negative attributes. \n\nThe monologue from her perspective when she\u2019s talking to the janitor ends with \u201c40 years ago\u201d and okay so this is Jake the janitor dwelling on a girl he wanted to approach at a bar when he was 30.\n\nObviously the title has a double meaning I\u2019m thinking of ending the relationship or I\u2019m thinking of killing myself. \n\nFamilies develop weird internal dynamics as they are isolated from outside influences. The farm is just to illustrate that isolation and show how grotesque meeting someone\u2019s family can seem and how much responsibility and expectation is built into that interaction. Janitor Jake watched his parents age and die for real, but meeting someone\u2019s parents creates the expectation that you may have to watch these people in their decline alongside your partner.\n\nIncredibly depressing and beautiful experience.", "I don't know about you guys but Toni Collette might as well be my early pick for Best Supporting Actress. She nailed this role as usual.", "This is going to be a long but thorough analysis of some of the scenes in the movie, during my second rewatch. I've tried to avoid or skim over things that have been already mentioned in a lot of your posts to avoid repetition. If you can make it till the end, please comment and let me know your thoughts. \n\nPart 1:\n\n- Lucy was thinking about wanting to meet Jake's parents to know his origins because \"the child is the father of the man\". Jake interrupts her thoughts, as if they are his own, to refer to a poem by Wordsworth that - upon Googling and reading the poem - begins with that same line: \"the child is the father of the man\". \nJake then goes on to say that this poem means a lot to him but doesn't get a chance to say why. The poem itself talks about seeing things as beautiful, magical, imbued with a \"celestial light\" when we are young, and then grow disillusioned and lose sight of that light as we get older. This reflects on how Jake felt hopeful in the past and how he feels now as an old janitor.\n\n- Jake also says says that Wordsworth has written a series of poems to a woman named Lucy, described as \"ideal\". He then goes on to add that she resembles HIS Lucy, not only by having the same name, but by being \"ideal\" too. Lucy laughs at the compliment but this dialogue forebodes the rest: Lucy is an imaginary girlfriend that Jake has conjured up, perhaps an amalgamation of different women, an ideal creation of his mind.\n\n- In the janitor's house, which seems to be the parents' old house (?), we have a brief cut of a swing set in his backyard. That same swing set appears in front of an abandoned house during Lucy and Jake's drive. Lucy sees the swing set and comments on it. Jake says he didn't see it. Maybe Jake is blinding himself from things that remind him of his lonely childhood (an empty house with an empty swing set, devoid of fun and warmth) and current loneliness. \n\n- Are the phone calls Lucy gets an attempt at snapping Jake out of his fantasy? We learn later on that it's Janitor Jake on the other end, expressing his fear and repeating that there is only \"one question to answer\". Maybe the question is: \"Do I want to die?\". Those phone calls are avoided many times; it's Jake putting off having to answer that question. \n\n- Lucy and Jake often interrupt each other and seem to know what the other is going to say before they've finished saying it. That's because Lucy and Jake are the same person and we are merely watching his stream of consciousness, with overlaps. Jake already knows the dialogue: he's the one creating it.\n\n- The two high-school girls (later seen as the mean girls in the ice cream shop) laugh at Janitor Jake and how he walks. Right after, we see Lucy looking at a spot on the corner of Jake's mouth. His self consciousness makes its way into his fantasy due to his encounter with the two girls and he wipes the corner of his mouth and tries to hide it, worried that Lucy was scrutinizing him or judging him. \n\n- Jake has \"Oklahoma!\" on the radio because that's the play the students were rehearsing at the school. Same happens when he watches a movie and Lucy morphs into the heroine of that movie for a few moments.\n\n- Lucy's recited poem in the car is about loneliness and aging. Jake says: \"it's like you wrote it about me\". We later see that poem in a book in Jake's house. That poem is resurfacing in his fantasy because it resonated in him when he first read it and because he is now contemplating suicide and so remembered it. Maybe he wishes that he was the one who wrote that poem. \n\n- The basement is mentioned often in the movie. We later discover that it's where Jake has hidden the paintings he's made when he was younger - because he's ashamed of them maybe, because they represent his broken dreams and failures. We notice that Lucy's paintings are there too but signed by another artist. In comparison, Jake's paintings seem small and bleak; he's painted the same scene over and over again. Maybe trying to get it exactly right, maybe because he felt stunted and didn't have anything else to paint. He imagines Lucy to have been a more talented painter than he was (and yet his parents don't seem to be impressed). It's a contrast of how Jake felt like he worked hard but couldn't get very far because he didn't have a lot of \"natural talent\".\n\n- Jake jokes about the basement being scary and says \"He's hiding in there\" ==> He is himself, hiding his dreams, his failures, his shame.. We also learn that he is washing his janitor costumes down there as well.\n\n- Jake's young mother is painted by Jake as being someone who doesn't respect Jake's privacy and who thinks of him as being a controlling child. She's the one who pushes Lucy to go into the basement to wash the nightgown; a place that Jake wanted to keep locked away.\n\n- \"Even ideas want to live. They grow in your brain, replacing real ideas\". \"Like a Virus\" ==> this is what Jake is basically doing, living through his fantasies because his real life is too empty.\n\n- Jake calls his parents for ages when he first arrives home and they make him wait for a prolonged time before coming downstairs. This hints about how empty the house felt for Jake, how his parents were so emotionally unavailable. A lot of signs point to that emotional unavailability throughout the movie such as the pig infested with maggots that was left to die in the barn or the food spread that no one eats.\n\n- Jake's attitude towards his parents changes as they age. From hostile and standoffish, he turns nurturing when his parents both fall ill. He resented his parents when he was younger for neglecting him  (the way he'd cringe away from his mother's kisses and touches for example) and for being cold and distant towards him. Additionally, the reasons why the parents behave in such an eccentric exaggerated way is because we are seeing them as Jake remembers them, as caricatures of their former real selves. He remembers his mother as a loud shrill woman, who comes off as uneducated - saying Genius Edition instead of Genus edition multiple times or referring to quantum physics as \"quantum psychics\". As for his father, he remembers him as a critical, lewd man who is too simple-minded and ignorant - \"Even I have heard of that\", he says when talking about Pierre and Marie Curie. \n\n- Jake's parents' reaction towards Lucy's paintings mirror how his parents must have acted when he showed them his own paintings when he was younger. Feigned interest, polite \"ah!\"s and \"mm!\"s. The father doesn't understand the point of a painting without a person in it telling us how to feel. He says he prefers \"sport photographs\". Jake uses Lucy in his imagination as the painter; perhaps his psyche cannot handle reliving the rejection of his work. \n\n- Lucy tells the story of how they met and Jake imagines it as he wished for it to happen. We find out later on that what really happened was that Jake just stared at her in a bar while she was with her girlfriend. In his imagination though, she portrays him as a very smart, big-worded man and herself as a kind of enamored ignorant groupie who didn't have the nerve to go up and talk to him. She \"messes up\" twice in her story though: 1) by confusing events, something pointed out by the father and 2) referring that her \"girlfriend wanted to leave\". We assume then that it's her friend who's a girl but Lucy/Jake is just slipping up in his story. When relistening, the story sounds made-up and forced, almost movie-like.\n\n- Jake's mother says that Jake didn't have a lot of friends growing up. She sadly says that \"friends are important cause life can be difficult\". This mirrors Jake's loneliness and complete lack of any social support. \n\n- There's an urn with Jimmy the dog's ashes in Jake's room. Explains why Jimmy pops in and out of existence. He's always shaking himself because maybe this is how Jake remembers him; a dog that's always wet and always outside. \n\n- Jake is an educated, smart, albeit socially awkward man with a childhood of negligence and a tense relationship with his parents. He seems to want to underline his superior intellect, his potential (we can see this through the many cultivated conversations he has, and how he often corrects the people around him, especially Lucy). He mentions people from school (such as himself) who were full of potential and then turned out to be nobodies. We are led to believe that he also missed his chances in life because his mother drilled into his head that he was not \"as naturally talented as other kids\". Maybe he ended up being a janitor because he spent his time taking care of his two ailing parents instead of furthering his career - because he still wants to win their love and approval. \n\n- For Jake, having a woman in his life means being validated by her and through her being validated by society (as smart, pretty, etc). We see this as Lucy validates Jake when he's taking care of his sick mother, calling him a \"devoted son\". Jake replies by saying that sometimes it feels like no one sees the good he does. We guess that even though he took care of his parents, they never really were grateful for it or expressed it. \n\n- Jake tries to delay his suicide for as long as possible: staying in the house, offering to return to the barn while they're in the car, stopping for ice cream, stopping at the school to drop the cups.. We see a lot of cups in the bin; this might mean that Jake has been down that path lots of times before and couldn't go through with it.", "This is maybe the best movie I\u2019ve ever seen that examines loneliness and sadness. He can\u2019t figure out why he is what he is: a janitor in a small town. He\u2019s intelligent, as is evidenced by his interests in poetry and art as well as the conversations he imagines with the women he wishes loved him. His mother even mentions that he was smart as a child. But he is caught in this small town, first as the caretaker of his parents who have dementia and health problems, then as a man who has never been anything other than a janitor. He gives up because his loneliness eats him up and as he dies and imagines a world of people that applaud him the real truth is what the pig says to him, someone had to be this person so it might as well be you. \n\nThe component of being smart but not especially smart and then having an elaborate fantasy life is really insightful. I think there are a lot of people like that. People who were never special but not dumb and can\u2019t escape the feeling that they should be more. They live in fantasy because it\u2019s better than living in the now and that fantasy is also painful because eventually they have to return to reality. The dance where he kills his fantasy self with the reality of himself is so beautiful and sad it honestly hurt to watch. \n\nThe components of the fantasy life really captures something about living in your own head that I don\u2019t think I see very much in film. The sudden changes in conversations he imagines. The intrusion of things that make him angry (real memories, I suspect, of things that did frustrate him at the time). Then his imagined meeting with his family wandering to his parents as elderly and faltering, as middle aged and doting, as strong and doing housework. It has a weird, unique quality of a mind wandering as someone imagines something. \n\nThere are a lot of details that really stuck with me but maybe the biggest was when the girl walks into the school and sees a dumpster full of Blizzard cups. Like J Alfred Prufrock measuring his life in coffee spoons, Jake has measured his lonely life in blizzards that he has purchased and eaten as he left work.", "The rewatch watch of this film is actually brilliant. The detail in the writing just blossoms. Pairs well with The Caretaker's \"Everywhere at the end of time\".\n\nThe fragmented, impulsive dialogue at the dinner scene is simply incredible and chilling - Kaufman constructs the damaged psyche of Jake perfectly here. You can map the way his mind jumps to fill in the blanks of this idealized conversation using the neurosis of his mother and the judgement of his father. What felt bizarre yet somehow lucid on first watch is now heartbreaking and constantly deteriorating.\n\nEverything just completely falls into place. \n\nAlso love the almost subliminal level of the reveals: Audio suddenly spikes on specific speech/breathing inflections, the parents' dialogue literally looping at times. More obviously: The actress for \"Lucy\" completely changes in the car for brief moments to the actress in the Diner movie, or his media collection being a table of contents for all of the car conversation. There is a ton of work done to illustrate Jake's mind with such detail I can't but be flat out astounded.", "I felt like while it was certainly well made and well preformed, it wasn't one of Kaufman's strongest films. At least in my view I feel like David Lynch handles these sort of films>! (where the protagonist is basically unable to cope with their own failures/inadequacies and creates a imaginary world around themselves) !<a lot better, with films like Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive.\n\nThe performances are definitely great and the film is shot, framed, lit and edited very well, but I found myself becoming less invested in the characters as the film went on>! as they continued dissociate with their original personalities and Jake's memories and fantasies got garbled up with poetry,5 minute long spoken essays on John Cassavettes  films  and prolonged ballet sequences etc.  !<At least in my view while the tone and atmosphere were very good at making me feel what the film wanted me to, it became difficult for me to remain invested in the main character or their struggle.\n\nI've loved most of Kaufman's work, but I think that this film is probably going to be the least accessible film he'll ever make and probably the one that illicits the most mixed reception from it's viewers.  For me, this definitely isn't a bad film by  any stretch, but at the same time, I'd probably put it as one of Kaufman's weakest films in my personal opinion, probably giving it a 6/10 because at least for me it felt un-involving.\n\nThat being said. I wish more filmmakers were able to have the balls/artistic freedom to make the kind of movies they wanted to and be willing/able to go out there and take risks. Even if the film didn't really work for me, Kaufman gets points as usual for his willingness to be out there and not play it safe, mainly because I'd rather see writers/directors like Kaufman attempt something and fail rather than constantly have their visions butchered by studio interference. Currently I'd say my favorite Kaufman movie is still Adaptation.", "I feel like Jake was an extremely depressed Philip Seymour Hoffman through a Matt Damon filter", "This movie hits hard if you're in a similar position as the protagonist. I think some of hate are from young fresh youths who have not lived a rough life. But i am biased the character and I are one.", "I\u2019m coming off the heels of watching this so like my thoughts aren\u2019t all there. I fucking loved it, my girlfriend really didn\u2019t. I feel like most people are gonna be pretty divided.\n\nAnyhow I loved the acting, the writing, and the horror elements. I read the book earlier this year so I wasn\u2019t as confused as I imagine most people will be, but that ending had me thinking a lot more than I would\u2019ve been. Much more subtle than the book\u2019s, which I appreciate.\n\nAnyways, I think Kaufman made another masterpiece. Some people will think he made an awful piece of shit. I get that. 10/10 for me.", "Did anyone else notice that the \u201cyoung lady\u2019s\u201d accent changed at times? In fact, it\u2019s literally a different actress (in the driving scene when she is discussing Gebord).", "I found reading the synopsis and explanation afterwards to be far more compelling than anything the film itself provided.\n\nThe film introduces itself as being in the mind of the girlfriend who is thinking of breaking up with her boyfriend.  How in god's name is any reasonable person supposed to make the connection that this is actually a fantasy on the part of the male character?  The clues given are far too few and vague, and I really doubt any more than an extreme minority of film watchers (who haven't read the book) would actually be able to correctly interpret the plot.  It's extremely poor execution, but since it's Kaufman it will largely get a pass because people will not want to appear to be \"dumb\" or \"unsophisticated.\"  Not \"getting it\" isn't a failure on your part, it's a failure of the filmmaker to convey a remotely coherent theme/narrative.\n\nI say this as someone who has absolutely adored a lot of Kaufman's work.  The difference in those films is that you have something compelling on the surface while watching, but with way deeper themes and meaning that you may miss the first time around.  I don't believe rewatching this film any number of times would have lead me particularly closer to its actual meaning, and I don't think what is presented on the screen consistently supports what it is supposedly about.", "I think this movie was the closest I've seen to representing a dream. You know those nights where you dream so much, you have so many dreams switching one after another after another but they all take place in the same room  and almost have the same narrative, but the environment and people differ just slightly (something out of place or different colored walls, same people wearing different clothes but doing the same actions etc.). I loved that aspect of it as someone who dreams a lot, it was like watching a series of dreams in motion, and sometimes you just can't make sense of dreams. I know from what I've been reading that it's supposedly Jake's thoughts before ending it, but it all really felt like watching someone dream.", "i know a guy who spoke exactly like jake. every damn thing. most of the times, the movie felt like a conversation he and i had when we used to talk and it was unsettling.\n\ni didn't like how real the conversations seemed yet they were written flawlessly.\nlast 30 mins were a drag and honestly, i have no idea what happened really. \n\np.s.: i ended things.

Half really cathartic and half incredibly painful to think about.", "I watched this movie so high, that when the janitor dude was watching that movie, and the credits rolled, I had to double check the remote to make sure the movie hadn\u2019t ended", "[deleted]", "So I guess everyone who understood the plot right away is way freakin smarter than us... My friends were watching this through Netflix Party together (2 Psych PhDs, 1 Speech Pathology, 1 Film Editor, 1 Engineer) and we all had no idea wtf was going on! *We felt high even though we weren\u2019t* and had to watch a YouTube video explaining to us what the hell we just watched for the past 2+ hours...\n\nOur theories were 1) she had dissociative identity disorder and each person was a manifestation of her personalities 2) she was kidnapped and grew up in that basement and that\u2019s why her memories are off and her picture is on the wall 3) there was some crazy time traveling plot like Donnie Darko 4) Jake and Lucy were the same entity... but we didn\u2019t understand how her interactions with his parents seemed real like meeting them for the first time if she didn\u2019t exist, why Jake flinched every time his mom tried to touch him, why the unnecessary zoom on his dad\u2019s gross ass toes, why the dog shook uncannily, why the girl in the ice cream place had blood on her arm (which apparently was a frostbite rash??), and why the movie busted out into a theatrical musical towards the end... and how the janitor/woman in the diner (aka Ashley from The Boys) came into play as she was flashed as Lucy a few times. \n\nBut watching the explanation video and reading this thread helped - just wish it wasn\u2019t necessary and we all experienced that aha moment at the end...", "The title of the film hits different when you realize what it actually means", "Anyone think it's kind of uplifting at the end?  The pig talking to him like they were friends, the girlfriend and old janitor hugging even though she confessed not even knowing him, almost like he made peace with all the things haunting him.  Then the beautiful mind acceptance speech makes it seem like he's grateful for all those people having been a part of him at all.", "Was Jake transgender?  His father saying Nancy, the discussions about not saying sissy in their family, and the multiple mentions of homosexuality combined with the Ice Cream woman talking to the girlfriend and calling her beautiful/nice gave me a vibe, especially combined with the one child statement by the dad and the childhood picture being a boy and a girl.", "Made me think about ending things.", "What was the connection with varnish and the third girl at the ice cream shop?", "My initial interpretation was that Jake was suffering from early Alzheimers/Dementia, he's losing track of his memories and is contemplating ending things because he saw how badly his father suffered. \n\nJessie Buckley was Jake's wife or girlfriend, he can't remember anymore. He can't remember how they met which is why we're given multiple versions of their first encounter. He can't remember her name which is why she's referred to as Lucy, Louise, and Ames throughout the film. He's even starting to forget what she looked like and is getting her appearance mixed with an actor (Colby Minifie from the Robert Zemeckis film). \n\nThis would \"explain\" why Jessie Buckley's costume changes through the film and why the film appears to be set in the '70s but characters have iPhones. It's also why the dog randomly appears, and it's also why characters randomly quote poems and literature. Jake is losing track of fiction and reality. \n\nHowever, I think the interpretation that Jake is a sad, old, and lonely man who's recounting his life through the lens of his attractive \"girlfriend\" is more accurate. He basically making up all these bullshit scenarios to keep on living but deep down he realises how pathetic it is. \"I'm thinking of ending things\" refers to Jake deciding to end fantasy.", "I really enjoyed the film but I sort of wish the explanation was more clear? I had to look through this thread just to understand what it was all supposed to mean and while I don\u2019t expect the film to hold my hand on that I also don\u2019t think a random five minute dance sequence was needed in replacement of some actual answers to what the hell was happening. I feel like knowing what\u2019s going on is going to make a rewatch really great but at the same time I thought the movie the entire time was the woman weighing the pros and cons of her relationship with this man, as we constantly shift from awkward uncomfortableness to somewhat normal behavior and conversation on a dime.", "This film was really fascinating. It got into my head in a subtle, but also dark and chilling way throughout its runtime and I found myself really in love with every moment of dialogue. Even the scenes which seem like 25 minutes of conversation are just so immersive. Really amazing movie. When it comes to the ending - I don\u2019t have the full intelligence to piece it all together yet but the interpretations I\u2019ve read so far are ones I don\u2019t identify with fully. So for now, I\u2019ll be reflecting and making sense of it on my own and try to find words to explain my own thoughts of it\u2019s chilling story.

It just felt like Kaufman was beating the same drum as Synecdoche.", "If there's one thing I've learned from watching Toni Collette, it's to never ever be alone in a house with her. Death and weird shit always happens around her.", "The basement door was one of the things I found most intriguing. I interpreted the scotch tape as a fragile and final attempt by Jake to keep crucial secrets locked away from other fragmented personalities. Fragile because Jake is nearing death and doesn\u2019t have the strength to create a stronger boundary against the part of his psyche that is wondering around and making discoveries: Lucy. \n\nPrior to Lucy entering the basement, we see the most vibrant version of his mother. She tells Lucy very revealing information: \u201cJake can be controlling. I think it\u2019s the other side of his type of personality. He needs to control everything. There are so many, many things that make him nervous.\u201d I\u2019ll come back to this in a sec....\n\nThe moment this version of his mom enters is a brilliant interpretation of someone suffering Dissociative Personality Disorder. In this case Jake. \n\nJakes mother at dinner constantly looking to him in fear, him forcing her to eat the baby food, or him deciding to show Lucy the barn first while his mother notices are just a few indications that Jake is the primary personality to the various fragmented personalities we are seeing interacting in his head. However, this begins to change. \n\nWhen the vibrant version of Jakes mother comes into play, you\u2019ll notice how abruptly she enters. This is also the only time we see her without Jake in the scene. Something in the conversation with Lucy and his dad right before triggered Jake, causing this energetic and young version of his mother to swiftly take control. \n\nObviously this mother was from a time when Jake was a child. She tells Lucy: \u201cI\u2019m probably to blame\u201d referring to his need to be in control and for the few people in his life to follow his rules. She must have caused some serious trauma and is a version of his mother he worked hard to keep suppressed.\nSomething caused him to slip up and you LITERALLY see her slide into the scene like she was waiting for the right moment. It\u2019s fascinating. \n\nNow we have a fragmented and dominant version of his mother in control of imagined and unaware Lucy. His mother tells Lucy to \u201ctake the darn nightgown to the basement.\u201d She does this in a hushed voice to not trigger Jake in taking back control. \n\nSeeing Jake inaudibly panicking and banging on the door as Lucy descends down, shows that Jake is losing the power to keep those in his life to follow his rules...referring back to what his mother mentions. These fragmented personalities schemed against him to reveal secrets. \n\nI think that\u2019s why the next interpretation of his mother is her dead. \n\nI could analyze the movie for hours, but this scene sort of was the realization of what was really going on and in who\u2019s mind and also just how mysterious the mind and these diseases are.", "Loved the movie, a great respite from my wife shaped loneliness.", "Half way through and I\u2019m giving up. I usually insist on seeing it to the end, but not this time, nothing makes sense.

All have quite sad titles. For example: abandoned friendships, futile efforts at success  and unforgettable mishaps. We can also see \"A beautiful mind\" and the poems by Wordsworth. Perhaps the books and dvds represents his memory and the red labeled homemade ones are his own experiences from childhood.", "I just finished the movie, as in RIGHT NOW, and I have too many thoughts to process. Reading a few of the comments pointed me towards some obvious things that I missed and that's on me. But I really think the movie was a bit of a drag multiple times.\nI was hooked to the movie in the start, then lost interest, then hooked again, then not hooked and that went on for 2 hours straight. \nI know many of you loved it, but I just failed to see the masterpiece. \n\nAlso, I know that it was all in his head, but many many things do not make sense. I like to dig deep into movies, and there are various things that made zero sense to me.", "I haven't read all 3,000 comments here, but have seen none that explain the long dialogues the way my wife and son and I interpreted them after watching this last night. \n\nWe saw them as iterations of a creative process. Like the janitor or Kaufman himself was trying out versions of dialogues. So what we see are the writer's attempts to find the right tone or make choices about what happens in a scene or interaction. \n\n\"What age should the parents be? Maybe middle aged? No it's better if they are older.\"\n\n\"The father's bandaid is on the right side of his forehead. No maybe it's on the left side.\"\n\n\"I like opening with the young woman saying to herself 'I'm thinking of ending things.'. Maybe she's waiting on the sidewalk to be picked up. No maybe they are already in his car on the way to the farm. Maybe the opening line goes like this. No maybe like this...\"\n\nSo we get many versions of both car rides strung together.", "I made the mistake of watching this while recovering from a breakdown. Wasn\u2019t my smartest choice, but very adept at portraying the feeling of losing your mind.", "I had mixed feelings about the film. On a first viewing I didn't really like it much at all, I thought it started strong but lost me from the long car conversation onwards. I thought the pacing was pretty bad, like I said the aforementioned car conversation for 20+ minutes slap bang in the middle of the film just seemed so indulgent and unnecessary. I thought the ideas could have been communicated better than through a long rambling conversation. It seemed so self-indulgent and really tested my patience.  And the end confused me - more on that in a second.\n\nIt reminded me of a few things - Eraserhead, with the awkward meeting with the parents at the start. Except in this it seemed to be more about anxiety surrounding relationships than becoming a father.\n\nAlso reminded me of the Todd Solondz film Dark Horse, with the theme of a loner character who has wasted opportunities he's had - and fantasises a lot about what's happening in his head.\n\nAnd the last thing it reminded me of was the game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. It takes place during a snowstorm, you end up at a high school and there's a twist about the games plot being a collection of fragmented memories. There's also a change in character perspective at the end that makes you rethink things.\n\nI read a review saying the whole film is from the perspective of Jake, not the girlfriend, which is never made very clear. I like surreal films and odd narratives but that just seemed willfully obtuse in a way that was off-putting, which can be said for a lot of the film.\n\nHaving said all that though, I do want to watch this again. I think it's a really interesting film and I'll probably watch it with a totally different perspective the second time around. I keep thinking about it.\n\nOn the other hand, I dunno. It seems to be a super depressing film about a guy looking back on his life and imagining what could have been. It just seemed like an excercise in bleak nihilism, I don't know what else I'm meant to get out of it.", "Hadn't read the book. The first 3/4 of the movie my husband and I thought it was about a woman with alzheimer's who didn't know what was going on and having memories from different times in her life. Then the last half hour of the movie we realized we were wrong and became very confused. After reading what it is supposed to be about I would say that it really gets in its own way. You can something beautiful and artistic and also comprehensible. The \"reveal\" section doesn't hit because it's message is so muddled.", "Basically, this movie really was a waste of time except for the scenes with Jake\u2019s parents which were amazing and captured so much about attachment and aging. \n\nOther than that, I found myself irritated and bored, especially when I found out it was Jake\u2019s fantasy and we were watching a pig infested with maggots kill himself. Do we really need another movie about a white guy\u2019s perspective on how some woman let him down? \n\nIt put me in the mind of what Louis CK\u2019s alone time must be like now", "Charlie Kaufman just has a way of speaking to me. \n\n\u201cEverything is tinged.

Is this some greater truth that I have not transcended far enough to fully realize? Or do we just like it\u2019s vibe?

I could also tell the person who made it was in total control of their intentions. Kaufman is a confident filmmaker. Though his films may feel like brain puzzles, he always has us emotionally invested even when we\u2019re trying to rationally make sense of the plot and its meanings. He never stops thinking the most of us. He trusts us to follow his train of thought even if the path isn\u2019t easy or pleasant. And I totally understand how some viewers might think this film is not for them - it\u2019s a deeply personal experience that will resonate with some people more than others. Even those who enjoyed the film seem to be loving it for very particular reasons and getting different things out of it (and that\u2019s great!).\n\nTo me, this is a story about our inner lives, about the fantasies we create in our internal worlds (minds) to cope, to feel less lonely and more worthy of love - and about the harsh contrast with a reality of buried aspirations, forgotten dreams, and the countless possibilities we renounce with every choice we make. You can either be a Broadway star or a renowned physicist, but life doesn\u2019t give you enough time to possibly be both. You can have all the intellectual resources and highest ambitions at you disposal, and still get to the end with no real opportunities and the persistent feeling you didn\u2019t live up to your potential. You can get caught up on a far-fetched concept of success and forget to cherish what you have. You can let the unresolved issues of a distant past linger on to the point they will define your present (psychologically, time is not linear, but unpredictable and chaotic). You can get so self-absorbed you\u2019ll disregard the most important people in your life and never resolve the complex relationships between you (notice how Jake acts aggressively towards his parents - even ashamed of their \u201cintellectual inferiority\" - but is shown to be devastated at the moment of their passing, or how important it is for him to make them proud of his achievements in the \u2013 clearly imaginary - final scene).\n\nAt the end, the hints that the three characters (Jake, the girl and the janitor) are the same person pay off in a big way. It\u2019s like Kaufman is telling us that we are not alone in our loneliness, that our inner thoughts are shared by countless people, and that we are all united by this great human experience. But this film is not a downer, even though I initially felt pretty low after seeing it. The more I think about it, the more I get the sense that the Kaufman is saying that we have a choice. That we can use our time here to truly connect with each other, to be open and show our true selves, to appreciate those we love while we still have them, and to have the courage to face our reality. Because the comfort of fantasy, he argues, will only takes us so far until it crumbles around us. Sure, it can hurt. But like the characters of Eternal Sunshine... realize when they choose to stay together (fully aware of the pain of an inevitable break up), the rewards of living it and taking a chance are worth it.", "Hey gang. After reading some comments here I\u2019m starting to think this whole movie takes place inside the janitors mind.

I read the story on Wikipedia, it made no sense, then I came here, read what the movie was really about and I am a bit intrigued. \n\nI caught quite early that the Janitor and Jake were possibly the same person, but I did not get in my limited viewing that the all the scenes in the past were fantasy. What REALLY bothers me, is the choice to frame the past events/fantasies from the point of view of the girl. It makes no sense, even when you know the twist, and it just makes the plot and especially the first viewing that much more obtuse and frustrating. \n\nWhy are we watching these events unfold from the point of view of a semi-conscious figment of imagination, if the point of the movie is that they are subjective memories of a real person? If it were from the pov of Jake, which makes more sense, it would have made the story more accessible, which I think is a pro in these kinds of movies, not a con.", "Went into this film similarly to Midsommar; that is to say totally blind to the director/story and expecting a straightforward horror film, but getting something more emotionally destructive that really really clicks with me.\n\nI think its a fairly straightforward film once you \"get it\", but the slow pacing >!and reveal of how it's all taking place in the janitor's fantasy!< turns the experience from an anxious mystery into something way more tragic.

I recommend reading the novel for a clearer understanding of what is actually going on... instead of trying to piece together this loose interpretation of the text.

Lots of great posts in here, especially talking about the plot of the book (which I haven't read), but I see a sort of meta-level to this that Kaufman added which I found very interesting and very sad.\n\n\"Janitor recalls a girl he tried to get with and fantasizes about whether it had worked out\".  Okay, sure.  That's technically the plot, but what really stays with me from the movie is the depression and dread.  I see the narrative as the internal struggle between \"this is what you want\" and \"this is what you deserve\".  This is exemplified by how Ms. Dream Girl, literally a fantasy, is constantly trying to end their relationship, to knock down his ego, to literally leave his family.  Every time things get too \"perfect\" in the fantasy, the neuroses creeps in ... over-correcting details of how it \"really\" is, changing minutia when they aren't ideal or he hits a dead end, etc.\n\nSo on the meta-level, very similar to Adaptation actually, we are seeing Charlie's neuroses and depression about his own abilities and worth.  Every \"ideal\" beat ends up being corrupted by a depressed self-doubt.\n\nIdeal: \"they're intellectuals and they have this great conversation about cinema\" -> self-doubt: \"you can't write good criticism, you're just going to end up pasting in some Pauline Kael review that you read once\"\n\nIdeal: \"there will be this great 'meet this family' scene\" -> self-doubt: \"you'll have to keep inserting quirky weirdness out of nowhere to keep it interesting\" (shown by Jesse Plemons literally nodding to give 'permission' for a conversation to go down a new path)\n\nIdeal: \"you can subvert the book ending and do a self-referential Kaufman thing\" -> self-doubt: \"they already do that in Oklahoma, you're just literally copying Oklahoma into the script\"\n\nI see Kaufman and sort of throwing his hands up and saying \"why can't it be better\" constantly.  There's a universe in which you can just adapt the book - \"it's just a fantasy!\" (not to diminish the book, again I haven't read it) - but by trying to \"Kaufmanize\" it, he is doubting his abilities to deliver and then puts that right into the screenplay.  You can almost hear him going \"aha, but the fantasy girl will meta-fy the story by not playing by the protagonist's rules\" and then thinking \"oh you're just getting that because you over-analyze how that type of device even works, you're anticipating your own Pauline Kael review before the movie even comes out and you're just trying to cleverly acknowledge and get ahead of it\" and then THAT makes it into the script.\n\nI'm rambling but, basically, this really struck a chord with me because I've always related to Kaufman's ability to make you feel internalized doubt and depression.  I think about Eternal Sunshine, where Joel thinks/writes \"why do I fall in love with every woman who shows me the least bit of attention\", and the camera reveals that Clementine is sat much farther away than we initially thought.  This movie felt like he had characters start ripping apart that scene and criticize why it's a cheap device that uses narrative cheats to manipulate your emotions.", "Watching this made me feel like I was going crazy.

For her to already be strong, skilled, and confident, made the only journey the literal one, which was pretty boring itself. \n\nAnd I know people will say \"but she had to learn to be true\". That's bs. There was no internal conflict about her hiding her gender, she was doing that to not be executed. For her to admit that she was a female in order to be \"true\" made no sense. She was there to protect her father, purposefully exposing herself not only put herself in danger but also her family.\n\nAlso, not having any level of introspection or struggle with the decision to leave home was utterly banal. She didn't even have to think about it, she just automatically left. She had no personal journey throughout the entire movie, and I thought that was the worst part.

It's not realistic that Mulan would be this pretty, but it's a mood.\n\nActually the more I think about it the less it makes sense. No other woman in the movie wears her hair down so it's not like wearing her hair down is affirming her womanhood. It's 100% just to look cool in an anachronistic fashion.

It cuts so fast. There should be a slow scene of Mulan putting on the armor, not just cutting to Mulan already in armor.\n\nAt the end of the day I think it's bizarre that it changes the message from \"anyone can be extraordinary\" to \"extraordinary people should not have to hide who they are\".", "One thing no one has mentioned is that the original animated movie wasn\u2019t afraid to have fun with the gender-swapping premise, but this film seems so mortally terrified of portraying anything even bordering on queer that the whole plot point of Mulan gender swapping feels more or less arbitrary and they seemed to skip past that plot point as quickly as possible, as if no one involved understood that it was the premise of the whole film.", "The movie came off as aggressively mediocre to me. \n\nVisually the movie is absolutely gorgeous.

Slow pace could have worked if the dialogue and screenplay were building to anything or if the writing was anything above abysmal.\n\nNot to come off too harshly, but it feels like someone surgically removed all the joy and energy out of the original and this was the result.

Every single actor's performance is so robotic yet somehow hammed up and cheesy that I get mental whiplash anytime someone talks. I have legitimately seen better performances on YouTube. Disney should have honestly let the characters speak in Chinese and put in subtitles, and maybe then we would have some better acting and performances. For example, do you remember how the dad gets drafted to war in the 1998 version and the mom tells Mulan \"This time he won't be coming back\" to make it painfully clear that the OLD BROKEN MAN is going to die in war? No? BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, but somehow some truly dumb Disney writer thought that was great dialogue to include. The film REFUSES to trust its audience to be remotely intelligent and overloads the film with terrible, TERRIBLE exposition and narration. \n\n\n\nThe 2020 version tries so hard to differentiate itself from the 1998 version that it goes full circle to be an ALMOST shot-for-shot remake except every shot has been bastardized and removed of any of its original emotional context and weight. Do you remember how EPIC the it was when Mulan made the decision to steal her father's armor and sword in the 1998 version? You've got that banging synth track with Mulan walking into the temple from the rain, lighting incense for a quick prayer, CUTTING HER OWN HAIR, stealing the gear, looking so badass that it scares her horse before she rides off into the rain? Then her dad finds out and collapses into the mud and rain to try and stop her? That AMAZING emotional sequence is condensed into Mulan picking up her dad's sword, cut to a scene of her suddenly wearing the armor, and then cut to a scene where her family realizing she took it. THAT IS LITERALLY ALL THAT HAPPENS FOR THAT SCENE. It's also followed up with more TRASH dialogue! Disney took the memorable lines \"Mother: you must go after her, she could be killed! Father: If I reveal her, she will be.\" to  \"Mother2020: you must stop her! the Northern invaders will kill her! Father2020: If I expose her our OWN people will kill her.\" \n\n\nIt's like the writers decided to take the script from the 1998 movie and were told to hit a higher word count like some bs high school assignment. ON TOP OF THAT, those lines are delivered SO TERRIBLY that it just adds to how stupid that scene is in the 2020 movie. The movie continuously jerks itself off by adding references and hints to the 1998 version by including blatant lines like Mulan LITERALLY saying to her family \"I will bring honor to us all\" (which gets repeated so much!) and unnecessary musical motifs of the original songs. This is what the ENTIRE film is like and any of the scenes added that are different form the 1998 version are so forgettable that I can't even remember what was added even though I watched this movie yesterday. \n\n\nThis movie's greatest flaw besides being utter trash, is that it is completely incapable of showing the story and relies so much on exposition and heavy handed scenes and musical cues. The entire time it felt like Disney was beating me over the head with Mickey's COVID, Bubonic plague, dick as if to say, \"DO YOU GET IT?! DO YOU FEEL WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL HERE?! DO YOU FUCKING GET IT!?\" \n\n\nThere's a scene in the 2020 movie that sticks out the most to me with this issue where the family guardian is characterized as a spirit phoenix (which btw is historically a symbol saved traditionally for royalty in ancient times but we'll get to that) that shows up to help Mulan when she's in trouble and the 1st time it shows up is so laughably bad. Mulan is dying in the desert and then this terrible CGI spirit phoenix shows up with a gag inducing musical cue to try and inspire its viewers. it's completely asinine and adds NOTHING to the story. It shows up again at the end in the most laughable scene where Mulan has a final showdown with the enemy and it flies right behind Mulan as she gains the upper hand and makes it look like Mulan has phoenix wings...It's as if Disney was trying to emulate the idea of the Grandma-nta Ray from Moana but failed because who cares about some shit CGI dumb ass bird? \n\n\n**The Characters:**\nYO THEY'RE SO BAD. \n\n\n**Mulan** is a sad insult to women empowerment everywhere. Instead of excelling due to her craftiness, intelligence and versatility the movie tells us she's special because she's born with more chi energy - something is usually only found in warriors aka men. By far the most insulting scene with her is during the great battle where she gets separated by the rest of the army into this utterly bizarre setting with thermal vents and yellow ice in the mountains and has a TERRIBLE fight with The Witch character and loses. Except she gets back up 10 second later and rips off all her armor (because as a woman she shouldn't wear armor right?) and rides into the battle to kick ass with great flowing hair and perfec make up while a NARRATOR SAYS THAT BECAUSE SHE'S FIGHTING AS A GIRL SHE CAN ACCESS ALL HER CHI POWERS. Basically you too can be special if you're born better than everyone else. All the rest of you women are stuck being married to bring honor to the family. Sucks to suck amiright Disney?! \n\n\n**The Emperor** - although it made me happy to see Jet Li in a movie again, he was a bad casting. The way he delivers his lines in English is more akin to a warlord than a wise emperor. Wrong vibes entirely.\n\n\n**The Parents** - LAUGHABLY bad. The mom is so cheesy and over dramatic and the dad seems incapable of expressing any emotion other than disappointment and anger....hang on...did Disney actually get this right?! Alright Disney fine. you get this and this only. \n\n\n**Bori Khan** - The main villain of this movie...oh my god he's so bad...Do you remember how terrifying Shan Yu was? Menacing voice, a cold but intelligent and powerful leader of a mongol horde? Yeah this guy is like a whupped chihuahua bitch trying to be tough. His version of intimidating the emperor was to slide his swords in the emperor's face to produce sparks after every sentence. HE DOES THIS LIKE 5 TIMES. It would be comical if it weren't so pathetic. His entire motivation is to avenge his dead dad and get gold...riveting. His first appearance in the movie is seriously hilarious and not intimidating at all. He has the STUPIDEST smile and close up. He looks like he's thinking \"SWIGGITY SWOOTY I'M COMING FOR THAT BOOTY\" \n\n\n**The Witch** - an added character for the 2020 movie that in theory was to act as a foil and contrast to Mulan. Another \"gifted\" women born with immense chi - she works with Bori Khan to overthrow China. I can't even begin to describe how shit her character is written... there are so many mind numbingly dumb scenes with her interactions with Mulan that consist of really shitty writing and more crap exposition. A character that COULD have been so interesting, was poorly executed and is UTTERLY forgettable. What an incredible waste of potential. \n\n\nLiterally every other character is bland, charmless and unnecessary. The solider trio are regulated to comic relief at best with about 10 lines in the whole movie between them all. Not to mention they turn the critical character of Captain Li Shang into two different characters which FAILS in providing the same weight of characterization that Captain Shang did.", "Rented it last night.  That was the most beautiful piece of plastic I've ever seen... So glad we only paid $30 rather than 4 tickets and concessions.  After this and Lion King, I think my family is pretty much done with the soulless, cash grab remakes by Disney.\n\nWe didn't understand that the bird lady was taking over people's bodies.  There were cuts in the film that made no sense... During a battle sequence Mulan is on the floor of the valley, then instantly she's high up the mountain shooting arrows at the enemy.  Then cut immediately to her after battle with her hair down, looking absolutely beautiful with makeup on.  That whole sequence was one big WTF.\n\nOne second she\u2019s talking to the bird lady in the throne room then cut to her running across rooftops.\n\nDuring the boss fight at the end they couldn't figure out what to do with her fellow soldiers so they decided to (for some unknown reason) have Mulan lock them in this corridor with the bad guys in a fight-to-the-death cage match that went on off screen through the end of the movie.\n\nI could go on.. but whatever.  It was not a good movie.", "Here's my take. I'm skipping past all things political here. Yes, the lead actress came out and supported Hong Kong police brutality. Yes, the credits thank CCP organizations that are complicit in numerous human rights violations. This is purely about the movie.\n\n*THE GOOD*\n\nBeautifully shot - You can tell that they really flexed their $200 million budget here. Lots of beautiful, sweeping arial shots of the diverse countrysides of China. Action sequences feel fluid and well orchestrated, and some can even appreciate the rotation of the shots to follow the action.\n\n*THE BAD*\n\n**Actor choice.** \\- Liu Yifei has the expressive variance as a slice of bread. I honestly do not understand why they chose her to helm the film. Throughout the majority of the film, her expression is not one of determination, or ambition, or loyalty, or any one of those good buzzwords. She just looks...slightly annoyed. That's it.\n\nThere are plenty of actors out there who are Asian, speak English well, and practice martial arts. Why her?\n\nNow, I understand star power and the need to draw in audiences with a flashy cast - but the rest of the cast is also criminally underused. (except for that part where you have Donnie Yen flexing his sword play). The most obvious case of this is Jet Li as the king, who displays absolutely none of his martial arts skill other than to throw some ribbons and catch an arrow. (I had no idea he was the king until after the movie, that's how underused he was)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So many goddamn tropes.** The \"I STAND WITH XXXX\". The \"I'm going to say that I'm going to kill her, but I'm not!\". The monologing villian. The obvious sacrifice. Why does the writing rely so heavily on tropes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Transitions.** What the hell is going on with the transitions? So many of the scenes cut from one to another and leave the audience in abject confusion. Also - when did we bring back fade to black transitions. For one or two scenes in a movie, fine - but Mulan uses fade to black as a transition liberally, and without good purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Unclear message.** Devotion to family? What the fuck is devotion to family. Loyalty, bravery, honesty, devotion to family. Which one of these do not belong? Why Disney decided to promote this as the tagline and motto of the film is befuddling to me. The scenes in which Mulan is showing devotion to her family are few and far in between. Indeed, the original animated film made no mention of this because it wasn't core to the movies values. This is an obvious and unnecessary shoehorn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Accents.** The accents are all over the place. Why, oh why did they do this? You have some guys coming in thick with their clearly American accent (Jimmy Wong, Ron Yuan), some with a New Zealand accent (Yoson An), and some with a thick Chinese accent (Liu Yifei, Gong Li, Tzi Ma). The numerous accents of Asian actors speaking English is jarring to say the least, and takes you completely out of the film. Even if I were to play devil's advocate and say that \"Different countries speak English with a different dialect\" and that the Chinese conscripted people from all provinces into it's army, it still makes zero sense to me why a singular village would have multiple different accents. Was it so hard to provide vocal 0coaches to these actors? For fucks sake, at least try! Look at Donnie Yen, who has quite clearly taken a lot of time to maintain his even accent.\n\nI also firmly believe that there is some obvious review manipulation going on by Disney. This film does not deserve 3.5 stars out of 4, [rogerebert.com](https://rogerebert.com). At best, this is a 2 star film.", "I had some major issues with this film. I pushed through but my god was it tough.\n\nI feel really bad for the supporting cast, especially her meant to be comrades. That was just lacking. And I swear they added an extra one and honestly it just made things confusing when they panned the scene to them because they're left as an unknown.\n\nThe music scores.. Even if they don't do the songs they could have at least used musical scores to reference. Like what they did with reflection.\n\nBird lady made no sense. Chi made no sense. Phoenix made no sense - could probably made into a dragon to reference mushu. \n\nAlso thought the phoenix was a kite when they first showed it. So yes CGI was weird at times. Weird transitions during battles.\n\nGood things?\nJet Li\nMulan Voice Actor cameo", "This was the most uninteresting and flat movie I can remember. I would be fucking pissed paying $30 for this", "I had to stop the movie midway after the first fight scene with the \"mongols\" to take a breather before finishing the movie. I gotta put it in quotes because they don't specifically say that it's the Huns/mongols. \n\nAs a comedy it works because no human being would act in any way that any of the written characters do. Everyone is so one-tone; from the beginning to the end no character had grown. There is literally no character growth for Mulan. If anything I felt more insulted that they displayed femininity in the way they showed in the movie. And that's even considering how patriarchal the old Chinese Empire was in ye old China.\n\nThe witch is supremely unecessary and was only used to \"humanize\" this version of Mulan. Because for some reason, women in Disney movies nowadays can do no wrong ever. So instead they made a character of what Mulan \"could be\" rather than showing that Mulan can fail so she can grow to a better person (You-know, like in the animated Mulan where she had really great character growth because she wasn't born perfect unlike 2020 Mulan). You know, like a normal person. So Mulan's character growth is literal exposition dumps from the witch's side of her story. I found myself rooting for no one apart the power off button but I spent money on this shitty movie. \n\nOne specific action scene really, really irked me and that was the avalanche scene. Not really a spoiler since it was a major big turning point in the animated movie. But in this movie... it's like the enemies were literally born and written stupid. How could a batallion of men who have easily raized multiple garrisons/forts be stupid enough to: \n\n1.) Stop attacking the enemy with their catapults. (Knowing they have MORE men than the Chinese army they were fighting.)\n\n2.) Command ALL their archers to attack, what seemed to be only a handful of enemies, the decoy. \n\n3.) Friggin re-aim their catapults (knowing full well that they were using it to combat very distant enemies AND the archers were already piroritizing the decoys) to aim directly at the snowy mountaintop. \n\n*Also the time it took Mulan to flank the enemy makes absolutely no sense considering that the enemy was faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar away and they already took out a few of the Chinese troops with their catapults. For a realistic tone that the movie pushes, it makes Mulan a superhero.\n\nNot only does it no longer make Mulan be the one person to cause the deaths of many of her enemies but it paints their enemies (who at this point was so much of a threat that the whole Empire needed to conscript villagers to fight) in the stupidest light. How can you conquer most of China if you don't even know how far your catapult is going to launch to. And Mongols knew what avalanches were. This was clear in the animated movie. In 2020 Mulan, they looked confused at what was going on. \n\nI normally turn my brain off when watching movies. But even without thinking too much, this movie just kept throwing the stupidest, idiotic, and harmful depictions of characters every second. No character acts normal; no character is smart enough to be a soldier let alone be a commander. \n\nAlso Mulan's sister; absolutely friggen useless. It only goes to show that Mulan is special and if you're not special then the only thing you're going to be good for is marriage and bumping out babies. That's literally the message the movie imparts in the end. \n\nThe direction is also one of the worst I've seen this year. How do you mess up fight scenes so much when ALL the actors have done their own stunts before and unlike a majority of America actors, have martial arts background. The scene where Donny Yen was showing his swordmanship skills to the soldiers was piss poor and also felt like it wasn't needed at all to continue the story. \n\nMulan animated movie: A strong 9/10. Would highly recommend.\n\nMulan 2020: A solid 3/10. I would reconsider purchasing the movie again even if I saw it at a $5 bin.", "[deleted]", "I enjoyed it, just not as much as the original animation. I don\u2019t think it was as bad as people were making it out to be tho I do agree it felt somewhat disconnected and was lacking soul. Some thoughts:  \n\nThere were several scenes that felt rushed and didn\u2019t leave as much impact. The one that stood out to me most was Mulan\u2019s decision to take her father\u2019s place. Idk if anyone remembers but in the original animation, Mulan walking through the rain, praying to her ancestors, cutting off her hair, paired with that background music really gave me chills. But in this live action, one moment she was staring at the armor, the next she is already dressed in it and ready to go. It just didn\u2019t have the same impact :/ To be fair, there were other scenes that I thought did translate pretty well. The avalanche scene for example; I liked seeing how Mulan used her smarts there to outwit the enemy without using some incredible power.  \n\nAs for the addition of the birds... the witch had me questioning, \u201cwhy are you still working with the enemy when they treat you like shit?\u201d \u201ccan\u2019t you just take over the emperor\u2019s body and make a royal decree or something?\u201d \u201cGirl, How did you just die by a single arrow?\u201d I also couldn\u2019t tell if the Phoenix was real or not, but I did end up liking how it was sort of a representative of Mulan being \u201creborn\u201d and accepting her true self.  \n\nIn conclusion, the animated classic is still far superior than the remake in both storytelling and overall mood imo. I couldn\u2019t help but to compare the two during certain scenes, but then again, I don\u2019t think a scene for scene remake would\u2019ve been a great idea either. Overall the cinematography was beautiful and the moral of the story was in the right place.", "Did this movie look really cheap to anyone else?", "For the first third, I was actually kind of liking the movie. Sure, the lack of characters like Mushu or the grandmother, and no musical numbers were a little disappointing. But it was nice seeing Disney do something different with a live-action remake, for a change. However, the second half was almost all wall to wall action. It just felt like an over the top martial arts movie, and not the good kind of martial arts movie. And since it was a Disney movie, the action sequences felt very sanitized. It's amazing how the animated movie manages to feel much darker, than this remake. The supporting characters didn\u2019t really stand out to me either, and I felt like they had way more personality in the original. I thought the witch Xianniang was an interesting villain, but Bori Khan was no match for Shan Yu. As a kid, Shan Yu actually scared me in the original. Bori Khan, not so much. Also, I did not like the whole thing with Mulan having these qi powers. It was like she was born with all of these incredible fighting abilities, and she didn\u2019t have to work hard to become a good warrior, which made her training kind of feel pointless. This movie had a lot of potential, but it ended up feeling very bland and lifeless. I'm not opposed to switching things up, but they stripped away almost everything that made the original so good, and the new additions just didn't land at all. Yeah, I don\u2019t think this is a movie I\u2019ll ever rewatch again. The original is one of my favorite Disney animated movies, and I\u2019ll just stick with that.", "Just saw the movie. I had an open mind and was very hopeful. I was disappointed that they got rid of some core characters and changed it from it's musical genre. Still I was hopeful for the movie, waiting for it to get better.\n\nThere were no true consequences to the actions and no one was ever in any real danger (relevant protagonists anyway) even when Mulan was discovered to be female and they tried to banish her there was no feeling of urgency or anxiety. She asked for death but asked so nonchalantly. uggggh\n\nThe movie had no soul and Mulan barely showed any emotional range the entire movie. It was literally a remake but with little to no enthusiasm. The characters were one dimensional and boring no surprises and very predictable. I had to force myself to get through it cause i always finish what i start. Hopefully they do better with future adaptations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey at least the action scemnes and visuals were amazing", "What a joke! This is one of the most bafflingly awkard, clumsy, and poorly-made blockbusters I\u2019ve seen in recent memory. The strange editing, the flat cinematography, the stilted performances and blocking... the whole thing felt incredibly amateurish. Even the sound editing and mixing was noticeably bad.\n\nEmotionally charged scenes that should\u2019ve elicited awe, wonder, or drama are instead confusing or, at its worst, unintentionally funny. The scene where Mulan decides to take her father\u2019s place in the war begins and ends in the span of two minutes. The weighty decision to run away from home, the family\u2019s shock at Mulan\u2019s disappearance, and Mulan\u2019s struggles to actually reach the training camp - all of it done in literally two minutes.\n\nMulan accomplishing a difficult training regiment felt unearned because it wasn\u2019t clear that she was even struggling in the first place. She was doing just fine along with all the other soldiers because for some reason she has superpowers in this movie. Mulan deciding to reveal her identity and then getting exiled from the army, only to be welcomed back with open arms literally two scenes later with the entire development being over and done with in the span of five minutes gave me whiplash. \n\nBut more than its embarrassing execution, nothing about this movie feels authentic. Its emotional themes, the characterizations and relationships in the movie are just as fake and groan-worthy as its awful CGI.\n\nThis is a lifeless, absurd mess of a film that felt like that scene in The Simpsons where Sideshow Bob kept stepping on multiple rakes that would continually smack him in the face regardless of where he turns. Just when you thought that this movie couldn\u2019t get any more terrible, you\u2019d get hit in the face in the very next scene with another rake handle. Surprise! I can\u2019t believe it got even worse!", "This was just a lose-lose. They\u2019ve stripped all the good parts out of the original animated film and lost Western audiences. But they\u2019ve mangled the so-called Chinese aspects horribly, from hideous makeup (no, upper class Chinese women in ancient times did not look like low rent geishas) to inane dialogue (asian audiences do NOT want stilted pronouncements on family, loyalty, devotion blah blah...) to hysterical costumes (as if a film about King Arthur had Versailles wigs and Greek tunics and Victorian hats, because oh it\u2019s all Europe and all time periods are the same). They\u2019ve tried to emulate wuxia film techniques without any of the wit or style. The film is getting savage reviews on Chinese sites. I guess Disney can just try to blame it all on politicking, instead of it being a shitty movie.", "Very boring and flat movie, reviewers were extremely generous. Sheng was physically misscast IMO. I went and watched the original Mulan right after and was so much more entertained. I did the exact same thing after watching live action Lion King.", "How 3 different versions of Mulan learned to fight  \nDisney's 1998 original - through military training    \n2009 - Father's friends thought Mulan at a young age.   \n2020 ver - \"Your chi is strong, Mulan\"", "I did like the fact they gave Ming-Na Wen (the voice of animated Mulan) a cameo near the end.", "Just saw the movie, it was terrible and a disgrace to the animated classic. It\u2019s baffling that it took $200m to make.", "This movie is was extremely disappointing. Why take the witch angle and she just had magical Jedi chi powers? I\u2019m so annoyed. Mulan was my favorite Disney movie because of the strong will of Mulan. This Mulan didn\u2019t even struggle. Her struggle was being too good. Eye roll", "Personally I didn't mind this movie as much as some people here. The two biggest criticisms I see are the inclusion of the Witch character and Mulan having 'super powers' ruining her arc (and the 3rd being the lacking acting skills of the main actress which... yeah). Those two make sense in context of what I think they were going for: While the 'original' was your typical story about self growth, this one was about  how marginalizing groups of people not only wastes the talent of their individuals, but also turns them against society.\n\nThe Witch helping Mulan made perfect sense because the reason why she was against the kingdom in the first place was that they didn't accept her as a warrior. The only person she felt any kind of affiliation to was Mulan, and when she saw that the kingdom had changed so far that they accepted Mulan as a warrior she saw the errors in her ways.\n\nI was quite happy with the movie pretty much until the Khan was defeated, but that's when the movie lost me a little. After that point suddenly the movie was pushing really hard that the theme of the movie was about family all along, which sure, was an element of the movie but hardly the most important aspect until that point. I feel like this was the most noticeable studio intervention trying to have a more family (or China?) friendly takeaway.\n\nAnyway, for me this was one of the better Disney remakes, for the fact alone that they tried to put a new spin on it instead of doing a shot for shot remake like Lion King.", "I\u2019m amazed by how this felt like a fully Chinese film with American dubs. I\u2019d love to hear the Chinese perspective on how close this film came to the myth of Mulan or whether this felt like an actual film created in China?", "I can finally get this off my chest. Saw a screening in December and, from what I'm reading from the reviews, it hasn't changed much from then (other than finalized visuals). I don't care about if it stayed completely true to the cartoon or if it had mushu. The movie itself is just not good and very boring. Rolled my eyes so many times, especially after each \"loyal, brave, :( true.\" Script is awful and pacing is erratic. Definitely has that Mary Sue issue and, honestly, the characters in this movie somehow discover teleportation or something. The battle scenes defy logic and look pretty, but not realistic which I would say is a valid criticism since they are going for realism. Why you sending 7 people to chase 12 people? Phoenix is super pointless. Vanity Fair review and the Chris Stuckmann review were both pretty accurate to me. \n\nFYI, audience reviews on rotten tomatoes has a loooot of first time 5 star reviews with questionable grammar/typos...", "On the one hand, Disney went in a different direction with the film in terms of story and message. And the \u201ccoming out\u201d metaphor isn\u2019t a bad message to have as a message inherently.\n\nBut given the original message was also about being true to yourself without having Mulan be naturally gifted is something I think is important to preserve and what made the movie special. Then again, I can always watch the original to get that message...\n\nI\u2019m conflicted because Mulan finally went a different direction, but I\u2019m not happy about it, and concerned that if this flops, Disney might think it\u2019s because it tried going a different direction with the story.", "Wow, this was a massive disappointment.\n\nIn the animated original, Mulan was remarkable because she made up for her lack of strength with intelligence and resourcefulness. But they wanted exciting fight scenes in this movie, so they had to come up with an explanation as to why the hell Mulan would have incredible strength and power against stronger seasoned warriors.. how about.. \"chi\"?! So the message of this movie becomes about \"accepting\" the power that she was born with, and not about showing that as a woman she can be powerful in other ways that don't require brute strength, and that that has its own value.\n\nThe acting was terrible overall. I felt no connection between characters, it felt like they were just reading lines to each other.\n\nAlso wtf was going on with Jet Li's voice in some of the scenes? Some really terrible dubbing or something..", "Wow that was incredibly corny. And that phoenix motif, I have no words", "this was disney's most soulless live-action remake yet. no heart compared to the original. this movie was 2 hours and yet i have no idea wtf happened, there was zero character development or introspection. the costumes looked fake and costume-y, just like the live-action aladdin's. i could go on, but i'm just disappointed lol.", "Something about this film felt hollow - the message felt clunky; the narrative felt overly reliant on montage but the montage failed (at least IMO) to capture the character development of its animated predecessor; the action sequences felt disjointed - an amalgamation of period heavy warfare and CROUCHING TIGER physics bending moments, lacking the fluidity and quality in the VFX to create as visually stunning a moment as the film thinks it's achieving. \n\nMESSAGE -- the theme of a woman finding and not hiding her individuality and talent is great...BUT, they frame this the most awkward of ways, in Mulan acting out of reverence to the sitting emperor. Yes, this does appear in the animated version, BUT Mulan's actions in that film feel more geared toward protecting her friends, her fellow soldiers and gives a more immediate connection to frame her actions. Here, the film failed to properly develop her connection with her fellow soldiers. She connects with one soldier - her love interest, which feels like a bit of betrayal for the message of the story.\n\nAdditionally, there's a moment where her father has an outburst early on regarding Mulan's place in the world...and it felt like overkill I remember thinking...like it's trying to hard to drive the point home at a detriment to the father character.  \n\nIn terms of the greater band of soldiers, I honestly could only remember the name of one of them by the end...they lack the development necessary to feel that bonding with Mulan. \n\nThis also bleeds into my second problems with the film: \n\nMONTAGE -- the animated film achieves certain narrative and developmental beats in the montage. Here, the montages (and there's quite a few of them) lack the sharpness and focus of its predecessor. We don't get the moments that make her building relationship with her fellow soldiers resonate. We don't get the moment where she really differentiates herself from the group as a leader (the flag pole sequence in the animation) and in fact the sequence they replace it with (the spear duel) on its own does not achieve the beat it needs to in that moment. \n\nACTION -- lack of fluidity and suspense within the warfare stuck out to me. I think there's a way to achieve a fusion of realistic battle and the surreal physics bending moments, but here the CROUCHING TIGER moments pop up out of nowhere, making deficiencies in (and over-reliance on) the VFX extra apparent. When I speak on fluidity, I'm taking about sequences like the hallway fight in INCEPTION, where the surreal comes naturally from a very grounded physical structure. \n\nSuspence is not milked here either...I honestly cannot remember a moment where I felt like a highlighted character was in danger during a battle sequence. Even the catapult sequence lacked the editing to fully milk the moment - I never felt like I had a physical grasp on their positioning within the groups...also I just didn't feel like the loss of human life that was seen was anything more than meat being thrown on the screen (it either needed more emotional or visual intensity - going with the former considering it's a Disney movie). \n\nANTAGONIST -- I like the idea of the witch being the antithesis of Mulan...it's an interesting addition but I think it drew away from the level of threat and fear felt towards the villains as whole in comparison to the animation. I think what could've solved this would be to draw back on the backstory developed regarding the main male villain - I don't think we needed that meeting scene. I guess it develops the strain between the witch and kahn but it was so quick and clunky, it didn't really work for me. \n\nI was looking forward to this film - MULAN is probably my favorite animated Disney film - I was not a fan of the price strategy as evident by my post history. But I was hopeful this film would really hit for me, and it just failed to resonate.", "Watched with 4K HDR. Cinematography & scenery are fantastic. Story is pretty good - stays true to the original while adding (and taking away) some things. \n\nDislike the idea of chi powers; very similar to Rey's \"natural\" force powers in SW. Overall was a pretty good movie. (7/10)", "The most annoying thing about this adaptation is the fact that Mulan has the personality of a white crayon (along with the awkward directing/cinematography)", "This was so disappointing to watch. The director/screenwriters/costume designers- they were all WHITE, which I believe is where the disconnect happened.  Everyone working on this film should\u2019ve been Chinese or of Chinese descent. It\u2019s so obvious that Disney didn\u2019t give AF about it being anything related to Chinese culture. Everyone talking in English just felt so out of place, some of the dialogue should\u2019ve been spoken in Chinese. I watched a Youtube video of a review and they pointed out that all the characters were speaking in different Chinese accents lolool like what a joke! How ridiculous! And the fact that Mulan already had her strength (or chi) in the first place, instead of working hard and improving at her skills.  Mulan is basically like Elsa where she finally \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d and finds the freedom to release all her powers.  This results in no buildup and growth from her character. Fucking disgrace.", "My biggest gripe is I feel like this movie lost all of the creativity of the animated film. Mulan using rockets/fireworks to cause the avalanche? Using weights to climb the pole? Using her fan to disarm? Dressing the men like consorts to sneak into the palace? This Mulan literally just kicks and punches her way through most of the fights. The only fight close to the original\u2019s creativity was her triggering the avalanche. \n\nIt also feels like her self acceptance was really forced and externally motivated. In the original animated movie, she\u2019s literally scorned and ignored until the absolute LAST second where she saves the emperor, but she never stops believing in herself. In this one, people just believe and accept her without reason? They ban her and then she trots back in with information from who knows where and suddenly she\u2019s leading the army? And she feels empowerment as a woman because... someone told her to.", "This movie should have been made in Chinese and had english subtitles.  It felt like an American caricature of what Chinese culture is.\n\nAlso, a war with no blood? This movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be realistic, or fake so it ended us somewhere in the mediocre middle.  IMO go all out fake or real, not halfway.", "It\u2019s just Disney\u2019s Frozen again but in China. Girl afraid of using her powers and finally facing it and using it to save the world.", "As if anyone was expecting more from Disney. Lol. If you think they're going to deliver quality at this point, I've got land on the moon to sell you.", "This is just a terrible movie. It\u2019s not controversial and therefore worth seeing. It\u2019s just garbage. You don\u2019t need to \u201cprotest\u201d\u2014it\u2019s just complete trash\u2014acting, graphics, fight scenes, writing, everything is TV soap opera level.", "Just finished it. It wasn\u2019t AS bad as I expected, but it was only ok.\n\nDid anyone else see see a theming issue with the \u201cdeath\u201d of Hua Jun and rise of Hua Mulan? Mulan would be dead if it wasn\u2019t for her corset which was an integral part of her disguise. Her disguise as a man actually saved her. \n\nThe battle scene where she gets the invaders to cause the avalanche through cleverness...I get what they were trying to do. But the original version feels inherently more satisfying because she\u2019s making a decision. She\u2019s the driver of the action. While she acts here as well, it feels less satisfying to me because she\u2019s just guessing that the invaders would turn the catapults around to fire. Her fate here was more passive and a gamble over the cartoon version (I\u2019m not articulating it clearly).\n\nA lot of pacing issues too. It felt like it could\u2019ve used another script treatment to really tighten everything up.", "I thought it was ok. It missed a lot of the magic of the original. I know they were trying to go for more realism but I though some of the dialog and story telling of the cartoon was more powerful than the live action.\n\nThat said, I was entertained and never bored. I didn't cry like I do every time in the original when her father says \"the greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.\"\n\nI feel like they tried to get deep with the dialog and just missed. Beautiful cinematography thought. I was truly blown away by some of that.", "So by American standards this movie sucks shit. How did it fare with Chinese audiences? What I mean is there\u2019s a certain level of corniness and cheesiness that Asians love that doesn\u2019t do as well among Western audiences.", "Just watched. I thought it was the best remake yet, but suffers from many of the problems so far. \n\nCinderella: really bland. \nAladdin: bland, some attempt at cultural accuracy. Overall too much of a 2019 imposition of feminist values on a patriarchal society. Gorgeous visuals. Cheesy music but some I liked. \nMulan: same thing, but with action sequences, and a little more innovation plot wise. I liked the more somber tone. Less music. I didn\u2019t mind. I think the lead actress carried her more serious role well. I don\u2019t think she needed to have acted more. I think maybe the movie didn\u2019t know what it was, and who it\u2019s audience was. But I definitely relished the absence of the humor of Aladdin, which sometimes was beyond cheese! \nLion King: watching it right now. A technological marvel, but what\u2019s new? Poses intriguing question though: is an exact remake what audiences want?\n\nOverall I didn\u2019t mind Mulan. It had less problems than the Aladdin remake. But I thought the same as others here, that Mulan was OP like Rey in Star Wars. She was just sort of gifted with in- born extraordinary power like a Princess. Did she even have to try? She wasn\u2019t as strong as the witch Gong Li played, but the witch didn\u2019t even want to harm her (that much). Major \u201cFrozen\u201d vibes. Elsa much? It\u2019s like the villains didn\u2019t try very hard either. \n\nAbsolutely stunning visuals though, and sometimes politically incorrect which I liked. Mulan, a killer? Mulan\u2019s father, who tells Mulan to suppress her gift? Ok. \n\nI think Mulan is a good direction for Disney. 6/10 with kudos. If you liked the Aladdin remake at all I think this won\u2019t be a waste of your $30. \n\nI thought the Aladdin remake was problematic and bland, but also stunning, and benign, and very carefully inoffensive which must have involved major mental aerobics. What came out is often contradictory and robotic, like Mulan, but also something of a feat because it\u2019s not absolutely soulless IMO.", "Non of my Chinese friend like this movie... All negative comments on the Chinese social media.", "I lost it when mulan rode into battle dropping her armour, waving her hair back and forth....and somersaulting off her horse to kick a spear back at the enemy.....", "Went to a test screening for this movie last year and thought it was fine so not planning on watching it again until it's free. I honestly don't remember much except for the witch switching sides, Ming Na Wen's cameo, and Jet Li being dubbed over for some reason. To anyone who's watched it is Jet Li's voice still dubbed over?", "The best part of the movie was being able to openly pan it with my family all the way through from the comfort of our living room.", "i'm reading these comments about over the top and cartoonish action choreography; am I the only one who thought of wuxia when seeing the action? Overall this movie was too sterile and corporate to have an impact but it did have flickers of Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (yes extremely tiny, microscopic flickers, but flickers nonetheless) in terms of epic scale and Chinese lore which I wish they expanded upon in the film. This ain't no A Touch of Zen, but it's at least relatively unique to the live-action adaptations imo.\n\nAlso did anyone catch a glaring grammatical error in the end when Mulan talks to her father? Is it not 'It is I WHO should apologize?' and not 'Is it I should apologize'? Unwatchable. /s", "It   was AWFUL. These critics are out of their damn mind. The score on IMDB is  3.8 and I agree with that range. For me it's personally a 2 or 3, but  a  4 at BEST. There are so many elements that just don't work.\n\nThe   tone is inconsistent. There's no time to breathe as it rushes through   the movie yet still somehow is longer than the original. It gets rid of   some of the best elements and replaces with new ones with NO   JUSTIFICATION or even try to make them equal to or better. \"It's more   mature\" is a complete lie as there is literal straight up unexplained   magic and supernatural elements that don't fit. Mulan flips and jumps   all over the place, has a horse the speed of light by getting from one   side of a battlefield to another in a flash, and the laws of physics   just don't apply to her for like... no reason. Scenes that are fine   animated feel super underwhelming here because the human element you   expect more gravitas. She literally murders maybe hundreds of people   without blinking an eye or thinking about it. You don't get a peak   inside her mind as a character and there is ZERO introspection.\n\nThe   biggest issue with watching at home is having the thought, \"I'd rather   be watching the original\" then realize, \"oh... I literally could with a   click of a button.\"\n\nIt looks   gorgeous though. CGI is pretty bad in some parts. Sound is fine, too.   Costumes are beautiful. However, It's silly and ridiculous in ways more   than the original to the point I TRULY don't understand why they didn't   just make it a musical or have some of the original characters. It's   tied with Lion King and Alice in Wonderland as the absolute worst of the   remakes. I was VERY excited for this movie, so imagine my immeasurable   disappointment when this was bad starting from around minute 2 or 3.\n\nIf   you want to support Asian cinema (ahem... or Disney, really) and if  you  have the money during these times, I say go for it with extreme  caution  (we all have different tastes, after all). But if you're a  broke  family, do yourself a favor and don't waste a dime despite any  begging  your children may do. If your kids haven't seen the original,  have them  watch that instead. But if you simply were on the fence and  looking for a  reason not to waste $30, let this be your sign that says  NO.", "Putting aside the obvious vitriol and public shenanigans around China and this film - the only thing I could praise about the movie was the costume design and \"some\" of the cinematography; which looks great at times although it's in service to nothing. The dialogue is bland, the performances are stilted, the action is wonky and the scale is dwarfed and goes against informing us that this is, in fact, an invading army. Somehow, with all this being said, the absolute worst part about the narrative is its intent to impress upon the importance of Mulan being blessed with a high level of Chi which completely undercuts the central theme of - just be true to yourself and endure - and transforms it into - She was the chosen one all along. 2/10 for me.", "It was OK. Was hoping it went full wuxia. Was surprised to find out jet li was the emperor. Didn't recognise him at all. Did they dub his voice? And that ming na wen cameo!!", "That scene where she reaches the top of the hill with the buckets of water was so strange. At no point did we ever see her struggle in the training (because superpowers) but that scene was framed as a triumphant achievement with everyone looking at her in awe. I was like... um okay? This is just par for the course with her? Why is the music suddenly swelling up and everyone is admiring her all of a sudden?\n\nMeanwhile her leaving her family was depicted in like three shots with no emotional weight whatsoever, when it\u2019s one of the biggest turning points in the entire story. I truly am baffled at the amount of poor decisions made in this movie.", " I feel the reservations I posted after the trailer came out panned out in the end. I feel both vindicated and disappointed.   \n   \nMy criticisms, specifically:   \n1. Mulan is more of a special, magical \"chosen one\" than an everyday person who makes extraordinary choices. This diminishes her power as a role model. Little kids who watch Mulan might think \"I'm not inherently amazing at things. I guess I'm not special like Mulan. I guess I'm more like Mulan's normal sister.\"\n\n2. The fighting is crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon magical-style, which is an issue for me because of criticism #1. It makes it seem even more like Mulan is just inherently magical, rather than someone who developed abilities through perseverance.   \n3. The villains are cartoonishly evil (and stupid), which I feel is dehumanizing (very \"us vs. them\")\n\n4. The dialogue is painfully on-the-nose. (\"you will die pretending to be something you are not.\" \"Yet here I stand, proof that there is a place for people like us\".)", "Watched it with my 9 year old niece. Two biggest problems with this movie were: \n\n1.)**They turned Mulan into a Jedi/Superhero**. Kicking flying arrows in the air into peoples heads and flying around. \n\n2.)I did find some of the visuals impressive but I swore half the time i felt I was watching the world's most expensive shampoo and cosmetics commercial with all those shots of her hair. \n\nI would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in the studio meeting where this was greenlit. They must have salivated at the chance of turning a beloved Chinese female character into a marvel superhero and get at the Chinese box office at the same time.\n\nThe politics that people are mad about aside, **it isn't worth $30** even if you had a viewing party. If you are of Asian origin and want a both good movie and with positive Asian role models for your kids, t**here are dozens of better choices** if they're willing to watch something Chinese/Korean/Taiwanese with subtitles.", "Despite everything about this movie, I still had to check it out simply because of how important the animated version was to me growing up as an ABC. Seeing the family dynamic as a young kid just really resonated to me, that in combination with it being the only Disney movie I knew at the time that had any sort of asian representation. \n\nWhile this live version is definitely lack luster, the not so subtle elements about family still hit me right in the feels and I appreciate that.", "I hear a lot of comments how the film was geared towards A chinese audience but I thought the opposite. It felt a like a mish mash of Western ideas and what they think historical China was in the film. Then I see the director and crew being mostly white people.

There was virtually no character development at all which led to a numb experience in terms of attachment or empathy towards the characters. I didn\u2019t care about anyone in the slightest. The \u201cwitch\u201d was overwhelmingly unnecessary and left the plot feeling clunky and rushed. There was no need for her whatsoever. I don\u2019t even need to get into the utter over usage of the slow motion.

This movie had all the same beats as the original but without any heart or emotional investing the viewer.

Her face is just too feminine (and honestly nothing wrong with that, but for this role in particular), it felt out of place. Even her roles in China are majority her being feminine and a damsel in distress, so why cast her as a hard-working teenager? (She\u2019s 30! Why couldn\u2019t they find an up-and-coming teenage actress who would\u2019ve loved playing the role of Mulan??)\nAlso, she can\u2019t act. I\u2019m not some supernova actor so maybe my creditability is not there, but you\u2019ve got to agree with me that she can\u2019t act. Her face is so stoic and even in that (SPOILER) crying scene with her father, she cries with a \ud83d\ude10face on. Even her dialogue is so monotoned. There\u2019s that one scene where she\u2019s feeding her horse an apple and instead of panning to her talking to her horse, you don\u2019t even see her face. I think the directors had her do a whole voiceover for that specific scene. \nAdding on, the accents of everyone\u2019s English just has me all over the place. Like this is probably just me, but I\u2019ve heard at least 4 different accents. First, her younger sister (in the past) has a sort of British accent. Second, the basic American accent. Third, the Chinese accent in English. Lastly, Donnie Yen just going full-blown Chinese when he said \u201cFa Mulan\u201d (don\u2019t know if anyone else heard that, but I did and it was the best dialogue in the whole movie). My takeaway is that this movie should\u2019ve just been in Chinese, cause when I heard Donnie Yen pronounce \u201cFa Mulan\u201d in the actual way that you say it in Chinese, it just felt... right.

They were trying for a more realistic Mulan but failed drastically at that with the \"powers\" Mulan seems to have and only special people have it.  Scenes,like when she falls off the roof and catches herself,look poorly filmed and edited and it goes on throughout the movie. Acting is meh but I blame the writers and directors not the actors because the way the story unfolds is horrible in my opinion and the writing at times again feels low budget\n\nEdit: reference to BollyWood I mean the scenes where they blow up a car and it goes 50 miles and still drives and kills every one in it's path. Scenes that defy science and real life that were in a movie that was supposed to be based on the actual Ballad of Mulan.

Share my opinions and 2. Inform how** ***Mulan*** **2020 is highly historically and culturally inaccurate.**\n\nFirst, I want to say that I did not #BoycottMulan because Liu Yi Fei, Donnie Yen, and Jet Li are my childhood and I simply wanted to see them in a movie. That being said, I will definitely NOT be paying for this movie because there are certain ideas behind this movie that I do not support. I watched it by borrowing a friend\u2019s Disney plus account who has bought *Mulan.*\n\nSince I already mentioned Liu Yi Fei, the cause of the #BoycottMulan hashtag, let us start from there. **I think it is hardly just Liu Yi Fei\u2019s fault**. I am saddened to see her being the center of blame when there is a much more giant, more painful, and a more disturbing reality that is at the root of all this, and it is not being discussed nearly as much as that one Weibo post (Weibo is Chinese Twitter.) **If Liu Yi Fei is the one at blame, let us hypothetically replace her with another celebrity to see if anything changes. If it were Jackie Chan who played Hua Mulan, it would have been the same. If it were Scarlett Johansson who played Hua Mulan, it would have been the same.** My point here is that no celebrity/actor/company, who has a significant impact on the Chinese audience, would want to speak against the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) because of the fear of being blacklisted by the Chinese market. This is the core issue. I hate police and rioter brutality just as much as the next person, and you and I can sit together and talk about that all day. Still, **it is almost impossible for us**, the ordinary people, **to stop large, capitalist, and money-thirsty organizations like Disney, Nike, and the NBA from submitting to China\u2019s authority and influence towards our economy.** Additionally, there are not many famous celebrities who have publicly spoken about the Hong Kong protests, and Liu Yi Fei, the actress who just happened to get signed to play a role as culturally impactful as Hua Mulan, happens to speak for Hong Kong police? To me, that sounds like the CCP was on her back, forcing her into supporting them, as that is a very common strategy by the CCP, forcing famous celebrities who have a large number of Chinese followers to spread certain ideas. **Stop making this just about Liu Yi Fei.**\n\nMoving on from this political stuff that makes me feel yucky, I would like to talk about a topic that I am much more passionate about: **the misrepresentation of Ancient Chinese culture and history in** ***Mulan*** **is horrendous.** For anyone who learned about Ancient Chinese history or has read \u6728\u5170\u8f9e (The Ballad of Mulan), they would know that, in reality, Hua Mulan is just a simple human being. When Hua Mulan was in the military, she trained harder, worked harder, and fought harder than any man could imagine. But of course, **a western (White American) production team from Disney could not understand how an average girl could combat feudalism and misogyny during Ancient China, so they had to give Hua Mulan some supernatural, fantasy, and Chi-like abilities.** For most western viewers, having Chi must scream Chinese Kung Fu and martial arts, but in Chinese viewers' eyes, **it is a misrepresentation.**\n\nThe story of Hua Mulan is set around the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589 AD). But in *Mulan*, not only do we see sets from the Southern and Northern Dynasties, we see sets (buildings, structures, costumes, etc.) ranging from the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD), the Yuan Dynasty (1231-1368 AD), and even the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD). **This much inconsistency around when the movie is set straight-up shows that Mulan's production team knows little to nothing about Ancient Chinese history.** Want another example of how the Disney production team is ignorant of Chinese culture? There is a part where Hua Mulan unsheathed her sword with the Chinese characters: \"\u5fe0\u52c7\u771f\" engraved on it. The huge issue here is that this is not an actual phrase used by Ancient Chinese people at all. Not even close. Sure, these Chinese characters existed back then but would not be used under any circumstances because they are not of the same vernacular. **After seeing that, it makes a lot of sense to me now to think that Disney probably just google translated \"Loyalty, Courage, and Honesty\" and just slapped that on. Truly ridiculous.**\n\nI watched many Chinese Fantasy TV shows growing up about Ancient China and whatever Disney has just created makes little to no similarities to those memories, to my past, to my history, to my culture. It seems like Disney did not even care about putting in the proper research and a result of that is just a silly product in which the only goal was to please the Asiana audience, and it even failed at doing that. **Having an entire White production team is not how you represent Ancient China. It is just Disney and Hollywood just trying to use casting to appeal to the diverse demographic but not changing the fundamental flaw of its predominantly White business.** ***Mulan*** **is just another complete joke that used actors of another race to tell White stories.**\n\nAlso, stop complaining about *Mulan* being $30+ on Disney +. It is America\u2019s fault that we\u2019re still in the middle of Covid-19, causing movie theatres to lose business, and now Disney has to compensate that loss by increasing the streaming price. America is not the only country where *Mulan* is being shown. Unlike in America, movie ticket prices are normal everywhere else so do not worry, Disney will still make a ton of money off of international profit alone just like always.", "I do enough to support the Uygher genocide just living in America and having to buy things made in China. The least I can do is to ignore this terrible move, also a product of human suffering.", "LOL at Mulan teleporting behind the trebuchets. WTF was that?? Some seriously piss poor editing and directing in this one.", "I torrented this the other day, couldn't even finish the first 15 minutes, garbage film.", "Mulan is how movies will look like if China buys Hollywood.", "It's fine. Like most \"controversial\" movies not nearly worth the fuss. It's a very pretty movie and not devoid of enjoyment, but overall very run-of-the-mill and obvious. \n\nAs a quick note, I've never actually seen the animated Mulan. I didn't really watch every Disney movie as a kid, not because there's anything wrong with them. I might watch it now just to see but if it sounds like I hadn't seen the original, it's because I haven't. \n\nStory is predictable, which is probably fine because most people watching this have either seen the animated version or are young. Sometimes when I know what a movie is going to be there's an aspect I hope for that ends up being my deal breaker. Like if I have to watch this movie hopefully it has this. In this case, I had hoped this would be violent. And I know that's a silly thing to ask for from Disney, but if you're gonna do a live action film revolving around war and battle then it should at least be on the table. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the action in this movie is not at all bloody or brutal. A lot of the most impressive moves revolve around acrobatics and deflecting swords, lots of kicking things and people. Almost no stabbing at all despite sword-based fighting. Also, I don't want to nitpick, but in that fireball catapult scene she literally teleported behind their army. She was looking right at them, and in two cuts she was behind them, totally hidden, Like no one saw her ride her horse around their front. And then she's right in harms way of the avalanche. That part honestly bugged the hell out of me.\n\nSo, that's pretty much all I have to say. There's some really beautiful shots and overall the aesthetic is pleasing, but the story is predictable as hell and the fighting didn't really do it for me. 5/10.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "Honestly, the only way I can believe the storyline of this movie is if Mulan fell into a coma when she fell off the roof and now she\u2019s dreaming.  It was very self insert and we never really saw her struggle...\n\nIt was also if the director had a checklist and every scene existed just to check something off.  \n\nAnd I really hated Mulan fighting with her hair down. And it ended up curled and perfect once she was still.  Have you ever tried to do anything with hair in your face?  Whenever I run, it super helps to have my long hair in a ponytail and Mulan just somehow fights with all her hair in her face!?  In one fight scene it even covers her face!!", "It is not useful to consider this movie as a remake of the 1998 Movie. Most comments and reviews of this movie I have seen are referring to it as a live action remake. Now, of course, this may be what Disney is officially calling it. However, it's not useful to think of the movie as this.\n\nFor example Disney recently made a live action remake of The Lion King which followed the exact same plot as the the original.\n\nMulan 2020 is different. The movie broadly follows the same plot at Mulan 1998 but there are some pretty major differences. Major differences being: new and different characters, not a musical, plot details.\n\nSo, I think it is more useful to think about it as both Mulan 1998 and Mulan 2020 are both different interpretations of the source material of the ballad of Hua Mulan (not that I'm claiming that either are true to the source material).", "It could be my age (40 years old) but this film was so boring I kept wishing it would end sooner.\n\nIt wasn't funny, the action scenes were boring (from a perspective of an asian who grew up watching HK action films) and the acting and movie sets felt very unnatural to me. \n\nI give this movie a 1 star out of 5.\n\nEdit: spelling mistake", "Not that Bad but not good either. The only part I liked was when Ming Na came to introduce Mulan in the ending. This movie got no heart. I hated that they used chi. I like me a good kung fu movie. I'm friggin Chinese but Disney should have kepted it rooted in realism with the exception of having mythical guardians like mushu. If Mulan didn't have chi in this movie, she be a nobody. WTF if I had a daughter, I wouldn't show her this movie because wtf is Chi? The point of Mulan is equality and that women/girls can achieve as much as men and bring honor to their family. This isn't Tai Chi Master (great Jet Li movie btw). I'm sure the actress is okay because I liked her in Forbidden Kingdom. Mulan's character is very stiff and the dialogue in the movie is atrocious. Mulan doesn't talk much  in the first 15 minutes. The chemistry with her father is nonexistent before she is sent off to war. Gong Li's character baffles me. She apparently uses chi to become an eagle. She also killed a shit ton of soldiers and all of a sudden has girl power epiphany in the end. Some backstory would be great but I really didn't give a damn about Gon g Li's character. This is really a shame because I really liked the cartoon movie. At least we will always have that.", "Just finished watching it. I knew it would never live up to the love and nostalgia I had as a kid for the animated one, but I didn't expect it to be so lifeless and flat. Even if I hadn't have seen the 1998 one I'd dislike this one.\n\nWhy did Mulan not just mention the spider or grab it?\n\nWhy is a quarter of the movie just slow motion roundhouse kicks while the victim watches it with zero attempt to move? And another quarter people catching or kicking back projectiles?\n\nHow the actual fuck did Mulan ride her horse around the back of the Rourans (to trigger the avalanche trap) without any of the 50-100 soldiers noticing her? We literally see her riding straight towards them from a short distance and then it cuts to her hiding behind them with no apparent knowledge of her even though every single one of them would have easily seen her without even trying.\n\nWhy did her chest bind stop the metal thing the witch threw at her, but the metal armour the soldiers wear don't stop arrows?\n\nWhy the hell did she remove all her armour and let her hair down riding into battle? Her armour wasn't a lie. It served no purpose other than to protect her. She basically handicapped herself riding into battle. My hair is slightly shorter than hers and I'm already blinded by it when running or just existing on a windy day.\n\nI'm so disappointed by how Mulan is in this movie. In the animated one her intelligence and resourcefulness was portrayed in her actions. Her strength was realistic for her experience and body so she relied on outsmarting enemies. In this one she just does loads of slow motion kicks and we have to have all the side characters tell us how amazing she is.", "Another problem that I have with the film: Battle Strategy.\n\nLike come on, China has a rich history in being extremely successful in war. The most well known war strategy book in the world *The Art of War* is written by a chinese person. So if you're going to have a film based on chinese soldiers then use those the strategies described in that book. Not \"let's give up the advantage of walls and meet them on the open battlefield without a geographic advantage...\"", "Fucking astonishing to think what Upgrade did with $5m and what Mulan did with $200m.

Like clearly you're making this movie with a focus on the Chinese market, casting mostly Chinese actors, and incorporating a ton of Chinese action elements like wire-work. So why hire Caro for the job? She had no experience in this genre and is relatively unknown (especially in China). But hey, if a generic unproven white guy director can be giving the keys to a big-budget action flick, then this I guess is progress that they'll give a movie like this to someone like Caro.", "Wow, this movie is bad.

That's what I think about the remake.", "Just finished watching Mulan and I tried to be very impartial about it not comparing it to the original but even as a standalone movie, it was only okay. I think it\u2019s too critical to say it was the worst most horrible movie. Anyway some of my thoughts:\n\n-visually stunning with great costumes\n\n-I thought the dad\u2019s acting was great compared to everyone else\n\n-LIU Yifei is so pretty but I know her acting isn\u2019t the best and I\u2019m sad to say it\u2019s the same for this movie (I had hope she was going to be better). She mastered \u201cthe emotionless stare\u201d but it\u2019s hard for her to evoke more emotion. Like even when the bird lady died in her arms, she just stared. Oh man that was frustrating.\n\n-Bird lady didn\u2019t need to be in there. I\u2019m convinced they just needed to use Gong Li to get some high ratings in China or something. I\u2019ve watched my fair share of Chinese dramas (xianxia and wuxia) and this bird witch lady did NOT do anything for this film. It made it really odd. Like another commenter said, either make the film full magical or make it full political. Adding this element but taking away the other stuff that made it unrealistic (ie. Mushu, cricket) just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n-literally, the Phoenix looked like a beautiful kite. It didn\u2019t have that \u201cwow! Ancestors are watching over me!\u201d factor\n\n-I had no idea Jet Li was the king. The whole time I was hating on the king for acting so wooden. I felt like he was just reciting lines and I didn\u2019t feel he was this powerful king at all. I was like who the heck is this guy? Whoops... it was Jet Li.\n\n-oh man... I am so disappointed they didn\u2019t show character development and more of the camaraderie between Mulan and the rest of the guys. I literally felt nothing for them and they were not memorable at all.\n\n-speaking of character development, I was extremely disappointed they decided to take the route of making Mulan overpowered since the beginning and she didn\u2019t seem to struggle physically at all during the training which was the whole thing in the animated film. Instead, it\u2019s more of \u201cyou\u2019ve always had that strength inside, you just have to embrace it and be your true self\u201d message. Which would\u2019ve been fine if they didn\u2019t friggin make her so overpowered in the first place! It reminded me of how I felt about watching Captain marvel. Not only overpowered but extremely intelligent in battle. There was no development on how she got to be this way! It all felt like she was born this way and that was it. \n\n-the interaction between the bird witch and Mulan: what the heck? \u201cJoin me\u201d??? This is a telling of Mulan in the army! Not some supernatural chi people trying to recruit others to take over the empire to prove their worth since women with chi are outcasted. What the hell?\n\n-there were too many overused motif\u2019s that kept on repeating in the movie: \u201cbring honor/dishonor\u201d \u201cloyal, brave, true\u201d \u201ckicking the weapons\u201d. It was repeated way too many times that it lost its wow factor or specialness.\n\nI\u2019m just disappointed :( but again, not a terrible film but it also wasn\u2019t great either.

The visuals were cool and the plane crash happening in reverse was an awesome sequence.  I'll give it a 6.5/10.", "I'm not sure if this is unpopular opinion, but that movie wasn't good. \n\nMaybe if I read explanations of the film, I would do a 180 and love it. But as it stands, I shouldn't have to get a movie explained to me. Inception did a good job of explaining what is going on and reading online helped me get down even deeper.", "A lot of people laughing at the \u201cincluding my son\u201d line, but my biggest unintentional laugh was when Sator is showing Kat the drawing by having his boat butler lift up the lid of the serving platter to reveal it.  The only thing missing was for him to say, \u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry...for nothing\u201d", "If your dialogue sounds like people reading a Wikipedia page, it ain\u2019t a good script", "Minor detail I really loved about the Freeport scene. When Blue Protagonist and Blue Neil are wheeling Kat into the burning building, Neil periodically looks over his shoulder. To the firemen rushing forward, the inverted pair would look like they were just wheeling Kat out in a stretcher, with Neil pulling it backwards and checking to see where he was going.", "I would just like to quickly reiterate what quite a few are saying about the inaudibility of the dialogue before moving to my larger points. I know we were in for it when I couldn't understand bits of dialogue in the two scenes (opera and trainyard) before the title card even appears.\n\nThis is a towering movie with the set pieces and locales, and the sheer scale was impressive to see in a movie theater.\n\nHowever, if you've got me for 2 hours and 30 minutes, then you've got me for 2 hours and 45 minutes.\n\nTake the time and give me two minutes filmed in medium close up and close ups (or, at least, not at such a far, voyeuristic distance as the scenes outside the school were shot) of some wholesome exchange with Elizabeth Debicki and her son. I want to *feel* that she cares. Debicki does a great job emoting, but she has to do too much of it through dialogue. What if there were even a scene where she protects her son from the abusive father, Satir? Nolan did a good job establishing pathos between Matthew McConaughey and Mackenzie Foy (young daughter) in INTERSTELLAR, so I know he's more than capable of this.\n\nWhat's happened to the dashes of wry humor in Nolan's previous work? Take the time and give me light banter between John David Washington and Robert Pattinson \u00e0 la Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy in INCEPTION. JDW and RP had great chemistry; lean into that!\n\nEven the first Nolan film to be described as \"constant climax\" (THE DARK KNIGHT) had room to breathe. This needed that desperately.\n\nJDW's character's name is The Protagonist? Is Nolan really using his $200 million high-concept espionage thriller to make some kind of metacommentary? There are shades of what he wanted to accomplish with DUNKIRK, which he said \"abandons the conventional ideas of backstory and dialogue to explain why we should have sympathy for a character.\" He didn't want the soldiers swapping stories about being back home, \"I miss my girl,\" etc. Now, that might work for an impressionistic war film, where we obviously want the protagonists (the Allied forces) to win. With TENET, though, we don't have that framework. You have to give us more than a \"Protagonist.\"\n\nFinally, does anyone else realize how unrealistic it would be for some of the inverted pieces to play out with no one else seeing them? Like, an entire fleet of boats traveling backwards? lol", ".gnihtyna dnatsrednu ylerab dluoc I tub ,taerg saw eivoM", "It\u2019s all well and good using practical effects, but did no one else think it looked fucking awful when you had red/blue team slowly and awkwardly walking backwards in the finale, before cutting to them and having them be at a full sprint?", "Who would\u2019ve thought what made a Christopher Nolan movie good is Jonathan Nolan", "Entire movie- Not sure if an inverted person is talking, or I just can\u2019t understand the dialogue....", "In my opinion, one of the weakest Nolan films.\n\nOvercomplicated and unsatisfying. \n\nIts like Nolan had an idea (the inverse) which was great, and wrote a story around it (which wasn't).

I had a brief 2 minutes where i understood what the fuck was going on. This needed heavy work in the editing room.", "Very cool concept, amazingly put on screen with superb effects.\n\nBut why did the story have to be so cliche? Bad guy threatens to destroy life without proper motivation, good guy needs to stop him but gets sidetrack by beautiful woman he just met, beautiful woman almost ruins everything by getting too emotional at the end, but good guy saves it by a couple of seconds. \n\nBut people run backwards.", "Where to even start here. There's good things, cool things, bad things, seemingly obviously flawed things. Like Interstellar this movie is just so many things that boiling it down to a review seems overwhelming. I found my thoughts while watching to be very contradictory, like I couldn't even decide if I was enjoying it or not.\n\nFirst off, I'll just admit it, I didn't really get this movie. I understood the concept behind the time manipulation and how it came into play, but I had a really hard time making sense of the plot or what the major goals were scene to scene. It felt like there was just a general goal and endless bad guys working against them. I assume Branaugh was just \"private military\" rich but it's never really explained.\n\nI think my main issue with this film is that when there's fighting happening and the concepts at play I'm on board, but whenever those things aren't happening I wanna jump off the boat. I enjoyed the Bond vibe they were going for but the first half of this movie is almost entirely made up of characters explaining things to the protagonist, or us. There's no real detective work happening other than just finding who knows more and convincing them to tell you over drinks, no cool spy stuff like dropping tails or espionage. Even that scene where the doctor explains the concepts was overall just a lot of really cliche trailer bait lines. And it feels like she's giving him a super power, but it's one that's mostly out of his control and is almost never used.\n\nSpeaking of the protagonist, I thought Washington did fine in this but could his character have been written any more boring? Despite a quip here and there he was not really especially intelligent, brutal, cunning, or charming. He was pretty everyman which is weird because he was painted as some sort of special savior. He was a capable fighter who could understand things that are explained to him, that's not really a character worthy of holding up this movie IMO.\n\nI will say that I didn't find the sound mixing to be a huge problem, although there's some obviously flawed decisions like having important conversations while a boat is going full speed. But even with believing I caught most of the dialogue every conversation seemed to be a jumble of hot words like plutonium, Sator, future, algorithm, etc. They explained the plot so often that I didn't have trouble following it, but the minutia of it seemed so unimportant they really didn't need to spend so much time telling it to us.\n\nBut, when the movie wants to be cool it has its moments. The dude getting his face grated, the hallway fight from both perspectives, the literal handful of times the movie had an ounce of humor, I especially enjoyed the car chase scene and I will say I think Elizabeth Debicki is the standout here although none of them were working with great dialogue. But even with all that I still didn't feel like this movie took the time concepts to their limit. I feel like in Inception he really pushed those ideas to the brink of madness. Whereas here the concept is simple enough and once you see it put to use the movie doesn't have many surprises in store. I kind of wish we got that climax scene of the storm on the facility from both forwards and backwards perspectives, one after the other, because I was having an especially hard time seeing how the forward benefitted the backward.\n\nOverall, I definitely didn't hate this movie. I have a strong urge to watch it again to try and catch all the ins and outs I probably missed, but I have an equally strong urge to not sit through all the dialogue again. This is a 6/10 for me. Pretty solid concept and I could really see a lot of people watching this movie and finding nothing wrong with it, but for me there were too many flaws to ignore.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "I'm glad to see everyone trashing the sound mixing, the dialogue, the characters and the final act. But for me the most disappointing thing about the movie was that they never really used the inversion concept in any meaningful way. The protagonist never catches anything outside of the first exposition thing and a gun in a fight scene. Outside of a few people running backward and some explosions played in reverse, replacing the inversion with a time machine would not change the overall plot of the movie at all.", "The car never entered a Turnstile. So, in the forward timeline, why do we see it \"uncrash\" and drive backwards? Wouldn't you just see a confused backwards man trying to operate a vehicle that behaves with regular physics?", "Man, I\u2019m disappointed. I think Nolan went too far on this one. The characters are flat, the dialogue is nothing but exposition which makes it feel stunted and awkward, you could barely hear anything over the sound design (that boat scene...), and not even Nolan seemed to understand what this movie was even about. It was a fantastic showcase of why theaters are the best place to watch films, but that\u2019s all it felt like: a tech showcase. This was more Nolan then any other Nolan film, and I\u2019ve just found out that is a bad thing. If you ever wondered what english sounds like to a non-english speaker, watch TENET.\n\nAt least Dune looked cool tho.", "I\u2019ve never realised up until this movie that Nolan films are filled with exposition. The dialogue was horrible in this! \n\n... \u2018including my son\u2019 ...", "I feel like the film could have been incredible if it gave The Protagonist and Neil some personal, emotional stakes.  \nThey had the Elizabeth storyline to inject some emotion and personal stakes into the movie, but that really should be taken care of by the main characters.  \nIt\u2019s like if, in Inception, Arthur was the one with the dead wife and Cobb was still the main character.  \n  \nBut once I told my brain to switch gears and watch it as a spy movie, where concept and spectacle are more important than deeply caring for the characters, I loved it!", "Nolan is so far up his ass but at least I appreciate the originality of his movies.", " \n\nTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Tenet. The story is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of time travel physics most of the plot will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also The Protagonist's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these scenes, to realise that they're not just clever- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Tenet truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the complexities in Kat's existential catchphrase \"INCLUDING MY SON,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Christopher Nolan's genius wit unfolds itself on their movie screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Tenet tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e", "I went and saw this the other day. It was my first time in a theater since Onward and I was really excited. Inception, TDK, and The Prestige are some of my favorite movies. \n\nIt made me so sad to admit I did not like this movie. Granted, I'm sure if I watch it again with subtitles I will enjoy it more. There was just SO much exposition everywhere that I am not ashamed to say I couldn't keep up. And I didn't think the sound was the issue, just the pure volume of information being vomited out the entire film. \n\nWhen it clicked that the movie would be revisiting scenes with our time traveling characters interacting with themselves, the movie definitely got more interesting. But I couldn't help but think, \"Man, that was a LONG, CONFUSING journey to get to a twist that's been done many times before.\" \n\nIn hindsight I can say I understand the movie in general, but it was a rough road getting there. I didn't think the inverted scenes were cool enough to make up for all the bland exposition. It's been said many times before, but the dialogue was bad and the last scene felt like a paintball match. \n\nPattinson stole the show. The movie should have focused on his character and his relationship with the protagonist more... Then the end of his character would have had more weight for me. \n\nTldr; As I saw on another thread, \"Inception was a complicated movie that made you feel smart, while Tenet is a complicated movie that makes you feel stupid.\"", "Shoutout to the unnamed henchmen who did the bad guys bidding, had literally zero exposition, and made no sense. I\u2019m sure he was in the loop on inversion being the top henchman and involved in all the bad guys antics, yet when he kills inverted Neil he looks very surprised/confused about what just happened. Then for some reason after that just decided not to use any of the other bullets in his gun to go ahead and shoot the Protagonist anyways? He aims at Protagonist, shoots inverted Neil, then forgets to shoot the protagonist. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t know about inversion, which I\u2019m pretty sure he does, his boss says hey go bury this plutonium with a massive explosion in some Russian mining town. There might be stuff happening backwards but don\u2019t worry about it, and he\u2019s just like \u201cokay boss sounds good to me\u201d no questions asked?", "So this film is basically a James Bond version of Red Dwarf's Backward episode, except nobody takes a negative entropy shit.", "I saw it almost a week ago and I'm still offended that Pattinson wasn't on any posters. My boy Neil was the best part of the movie. Fucking blasphemy, he should have been on posters.", "Love that Christopher Nolan is doing all he can to preserve cinema in all form, even older ones. Very cool he\u2019s keeping silent film alive by using Tenet to deafen us, therefore making all future films silent films.", "Did the movie seem uncomfortably loud to anyone else? Maybe my ears just need to readjust to the theater speakers.", "The movie was extremely reliant on dialogue and then it was incredibly hard to understand what exactly was being said. The movie felt like a mess. The action scenes weren\u2019t anything to write home about either. I think it was an interesting concept but could have been much better", "Pros:\n\nEverything Ludwig G\u00f6ransson touches is gold.\n\nNolan's hand-to-hand action scenes have improved immensely since the days of the Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nThe inverting is a really cool visual, especially once the Protagonist gets inverted to go save Kat.\n\nThe performances are good all around. John David Washington is really slick, but not too slick. Robert Pattinson is good, but I felt he could have been used more.\n\nNever heard of Dimple Kapadia before, but she is gorgeous. I hope I look even half that good when I reach her age.\n\nI didn't really buy the idea of a romantic relationship between the Protagonist and Kat, so I'm glad they never went beyond a chaste kiss on the cheek (although I do like a good tall girl / short guy couple).\n\nCons:\n\nThe sound mixing. Holy. Shit. I thought there was something wrong with my theater until I saw this thread.\n\nI thought the pacing was off. We would have scenes where characters are spouting their dialogue like it's a race, the story jumping to a different continent without explanation, and then everything coming to a screeching halt so Elizabeth Debicki can monologue about motherhood.\n\nSome of the dialogue is not great. Some things are over explained or under explained, Kat gets some cringey lines and everything Sator says is a clich\u00e9.\n\nThe final battle is a mess. They cut back and forth between the red and blue teams too quickly to really keep track of what is happening and when. And we see maybe a handful of Sator's henchmen? It seems like they sent two armies to take out six dudes. There are some cool moments - like the blue soldier getting sucked into a wall - but it's mostly very muddled.\n\nHard to say overall. It's a really cool take on time travel with some solid action scenes, but the sound mixing is so, so bad. And when you have a movie with so much exposition you can't really afford to make so much of the dialogue unintelligible. The more I think about it, the less I like it. For me, this might have replaced TDKR as Nolan's worst film.", "The action scenes, the soundtrack and the sound effects were amazing. The plot and writing were so slow at times and hard to understand at others. John David Washington\u2019s character was so stoic through the whole film. We rarely see him crack a smile or come across as human with a backstory showing his reason for being badass. Robert Pattinson\u2019s character was a little intriguing at times and cheesy at others. Elizabeth Dabicki\u2019s character was really good but the \u201cmy son\u201d longing seemed a little stretched over and over again. I couldn\u2019t see Michael Caine or Kenneth Branagh as just them as actors so it was hard to fully emerge with their scenes. I sat through the whole movie and I can\u2019t really explained what was going on with the backwards stuff or even what the movie was about. It wasn\u2019t a bad movie but I\u2019m not dying to see it again anytime soon. Maybe an interesting concept but difficult to pull off? I think Nolan did a great job trying to explain hard concepts in other films like interstellar, memento and inception but this one was tough.", "I haven\u2019t seen it yet but reading all these comments about people not being able to hear the dialogue is unreal.  Why wouldn\u2019t someone in production fix that?  I won\u2019t bother seeing it in theatre now and will wait till I can watch it with subtitles", "The audio mix was atrocious. Not everything needs to be perfectly audible, but when plot/story important dialogue is unintelligible, there's a problem. It strays from artistic choice to stick up ass.", "Fuck that was fun. I missed theaters so much. Had it all to myself too!", "I feel Nolan wanted a movie with the concept of the pincer move, which i love. It's a pretty neat time travel concept that I don't recall being done before. He then felt the need to attach the usual parts of a movie to it, for it to feel whole. \n\nI couldn't give two shits about what's her name and her son. The son had about 20 seconds of screen time. Him being shoehorned in to provide some emotional stakes for the protagonist's romantic relationship did nothing.", "I wanted to like this movie so much, but couldn\u2019t. It was convoluted and worst of all, boring. Inception is one of my favorite movies and this had none of what made that movie work. Mainly the characters. I didn\u2019t really ever understand JDW\u2019s motives. He was only the on the nose \u201cprotagonist.\u201d Like, seriously? I mean, saving the world is a noble cause, but I should care more about you doing so. \n\nIs it even possible for Kenneth Branagh to play a character without an over the top accent? Michael Caine as a cameo is fine and Pattinson was pretty good - maybe even a standout. I didn\u2019t care about the woman that was so central to the movie. Not really at all. She wasn\u2019t interesting and was shoed into an abusive relationship to protect her son trope.\n\nI did appreciate the lack of cgi and some of the thought that went into pulling certain things off, but it didn\u2019t make up for how confused I was.\n\nWhy was a \u201ctime bomb\u201d kept being referred to as an algorithm. Did no one not know what algorithm means? An algorithm in physical form or pieces makes no sense. I feel like Nolan thought \u201cBomb\u201d wouldn\u2019t be cerebral enough.\n\nOverall I\u2019m pretty disappointed.", "Think Nolan did a whole bottle of adderall then locked himself in a room and wrote this in 20m", "\u201cDon\u2019t think about it, just feel it\u201d\n\nThis is an actual line from the movie! \n\nIt feels directly targeted at all of the people who point out the logic gaps in his movies (especially Inception/Interstellar)", "Gave it a second watch today, and I expected some of the knowledge from the first watch-through to grant some explanation and make it a better viewing the second time around, and it really didn't.\n\nOn my first watch-through, I was really disappointed by the lack of explanation given for phenomenon. Literally, the first time the Protag asks someone \"how does this work\", and they tell him \"don't think about it\". I feel like that is the underlying motive behind most of the writing throughout the film: not that there is some reasonable explanation in the writer's mind about how things work the way they do within the movie, but that they just want the world to just move and work a certain way and their viewer's desire for explanation is just not important enough for dialogue.\n\nI feel that this movie drops from \"cerebral thriller\" to \"poorly explained special effects cash-grab\". They milked the sh\\*t out of the moving forward//moving backward effect, even blowing up a building in two different \"directions\" back-to-back. Cool. But the explanation for things was like \"quantum science genius-babble\" at best and.... \"just dont think about it\" at worst.\n\nIn the final climactic battle scene, I kept thinking \"who are they fighting?\" and \"why do they never show who they are fighting?\" It seems like the soldiers are just shooting stuff: buildings, rocks, windows... and the whole plot item of \"The Algorithm\".... what the hell is that? It has 9 pieces, but he has 8 of them already, and if you assemble it, the world's time is reversed and... the universe ends? But not when it is assembled, but when the bad guy dies...

The time inversion stuff is creative and relatively easy to follow (albeit chaotic at times), but the spy elements are a total mess and too much info is crammed into the first act. It's almost like Nolan had this good sci-fi idea conjured up, but since it's not as complex as the dreams in Inception, he instead made the things *around* the idea complex - and needlessly so.\n\nSide note, Debicki's popularity skyrocketed in my country since the film's opening last week.

When Sator dies, his deadman's switch will broadcast the GPS position of the algorithm so that the antagonists in the future can excavate it and use it to reverse all of entropy, thereby ending the past. Tenet needs to get to it first so they can hide it, thereby preventing the future antagonists from using it to end the world.\nSo... why does Tenet need to retrieve the algorithm BEFORE the explosion and before Sator dies? Can't they go back to the spot literally any time after Sator's death, dig up the algorithm, and hide it? Granted it would be a lot more work but Tenet has the advantage of time on their side. Priya says the algorithm is invented \"many generations from now\" so it's not like the antagonists can invert and go back 100's of years to retrieve it, they would die on the way. They can only dig it up in the future.\nMaybe I'm missing something but I'm struggling to figure out where the sense of urgency comes from in the final act.", "Just got out of an IMAX screening.\n\nMixed emotions. As I'm watching the movie, I have enough awareness to say, \"OK, this is confusing / I am confused.\" In that sense, I was frustrated. I tried to just let it slide (\"don't try to understand it, feel it\" well I took that to heart), but it made some of the action and set pieces harder to appreciate as I was trying to make sense of it in real-time.\n\nOtherwise, the movie really is a technical marvel and I'm glad I watched it in IMAX. Seeing the second POV fight scenes were terrific. Still, in terms of \"awe\" -- I think Interstellar achieved that better for me and was more emotional for me since I felt for the characters. This movie, however, is *very cold* with little in the way to connect to them. Builds off similarly to Dunkirk, but I didn't mind it as much in that movie. Frankly, I didn't mind it much either here but it is worth noting nonetheless. Also, I thought it was really silly to just have Washington's character named The Protagonist (minor gripe for sure and I knew that ahead of time).\n\nI had to watch an IGN explainer afterwards which frankly did a great job and it made me definitely appreciate the movie more. I need to watch the film a second time, but it does bring up the question of the quality of a movie if a second viewing is required to appreciate it and in my opinion, if one is needed I think that is a negative and fair criticism of said movie.\n\nThe audio is terrible. I'm appalled and flabbergasted that the movie made on screen without having that addressed. Big negative and I give no pass for Nolan -- the same has been said about his previous films so why the hell does he still do this lol? And finally, the end of the movie is really abrupt. I could tell the audience was put off by it in my theater and frankly it was a bit underwhelming. I did enjoy the soundtrack overall though.\n\nI really, really, really was looking forward to this film. That being said, this is a B/B+ for me which is mainly saved by the technical and sheer balls of Nolan going for it so to speak. Whereas I have reached plenty of Nolan's past films multiple times (not Dunkirk though), this one may got only a one more viewing for me at a later date.\n\nEdit: I wrote the above on Monday after watching it. Since then, I have watched a pirated version and realized two things: first, I appreciate the action scenes even more; the dialogue is still clunky; the first hour is almost all exposition and there's nothing really interesting nor redeeming about that part. Finally, it has to be repeated -- the car chase and the Airport fight scene were the highlights and it kept me on my toes. The rest of the movie has a lot to be desired for. I came out saying B/B+, and then saying B+ and I will stick with that mainly for the sheer balls to go for a movie like this.", "Just got out of the movie and I have no idea what I just watched.", "And the Academy Award for loudest picture goes to...", "This film, in my opinion, was god awful from start to finish. The problems: \n\n\\-we are not given a single reason to give a shit about any of the characters or the success of their mission, apart from the boring, usual, 'if we dont do this the world is gunna end' bullshit\n\n\\-because we ultimately have no character development, and no reason to give a shit the whole film, there is absolutely **zero tension** the whole movie. Why should I give a shit if 'the protagonist' is going through an inverted gunfight if I know, pretty much for a fact, that the world isn't going to be destroyed and there are no other personal stakes for me to care about. Sure, 'Kat' might be out to save her child, but why should I care? \n\n\\-the dialogue felt incredibly *fast* throughout the whole film. Each exchange of dialogue was so rapid, with quick cuts, that you literally aren't given a second to digest anything. It felt like a YouTube vlog the whole movie. I mean, jesus, give a character some TIME to digest what's being told to them.\n\n\\-This last point also relates to the pacing of the film. This film moves at a lightning fast pace. With each new scene, the protagonist is in like an entirely new situation and even part of the world. Given the already 'high concept' nature of the film, this jumping around locations at a lightning pace just overwhelms and confuses the audience.  \n\n\\-the sound mixing was also terrible. My friend said that it would've been better to see it with subtitles on, and I agree, because there are so many instances in the film where you simply **can't understand what the characters are saying** \n\n\\-the central concept, 'tenet' (or whatever time inversion shit the word is supposed to represent) isn't properly explained, and is barely used for the whole movie. It's kind of just chucked in whenever they need a cool scene\n\n\\-the last 30 minutes of the movie was just horrible. There was rubble, explosions, screaming, inverison shit happening. There was just so much nonsense on screen that it was hard to follow, and once again, **no tension**, because there were no stakes. Like, obviously they're gunna succeed in not setting off the fucking doomsday device. \n\n\\-I love how like, 3/4 into the film they're just like, oh shit yeah, Andrei has cancer. So that's why he's doing all of this. Cause if he dies he doesn't want the world to exist because he can't be in it. Like ok? what a terrible way to reveal a villain's motives, and what a shitty motive it is\n\n\\-There are so many other problems, but the main thing is I just left the theatre feeling confused, bored, and unfulfilled. There's no relief in the audience when the characters succeed in the mission, the only relief is being able to get the fuck out of the theatre.", "Cheese grater, jfc", "How the hell do you even write this thing?

In this film, I was constantly leaning to my partner asking \"what's going on?\" LOL.", "Was anyone else's theater playing the movie extremely, extremely loud?

I know perfectly well that character is not the alpha and omega of film, or indeed any dramatic or narrative form.\n\nI can deal with a poorly written movie. While I'd prefer a well written one, obviously, and I love clever dialogue, I'm enough of a devotee of opera to not be bothered by merely functional text.\n\nI can deal with a movie where much of the dialogue is unintelligible. I like Robert Altman.\n\nI can even deal with a movie that has a convoluted temporal structure and little explanation. I love *Primer*: great little movie.\n\nBut *Tenet* asked me to go through all of that for-- dullness. The story was dull; the spectacle was unremarkable; the music was a plod.\n\nOK, we get it: Christopher Nolan saw a Sator square one time, and wanted to make a time travel movie. That's not enough.\n\nAt least Sir Kenneth is helping to pay down Tottenham's stadium debt, or something.", "I brought ear plugs to the IMAX showing just in case and am super glad I did. I wore them just softly and halfway in the ear during the loud sequences and I was able to follow all the dialogue.

Obviously he should save her, but he is also tasked with saving the world, so one of those seems like it should be prioritized.", "For me this was clearly Nolan\u2019s worst movie on first watch. And I say that as a huge fan he\u2019s a guy who has probably made 3 of my top 10 favorite movies (prestige, dark knight, memento) and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of his movies so far.. I did not like tenet. \n\nThe pacing/editing the first part of the movie was just not good, this is kind of a thing Nolan does where he jumps from place to place without showing action in between, but in this case it was just straight up confusing and I really didn\u2019t feel like he gave the viewer any time to get a grasp on the characters or the situation that was unfolding. It took a lot of guesswork to piece together who and what we were dealing with. This really left me feeling like I wasn\u2019t fully immersed in the action scenes because I was still trying to figure out why the action was taking place rather than being able to get swept up in it, I wasn\u2019t holding my breath to see what was going to happen because I didn\u2019t know what was happening.\n\nI just feel like the whole plot that the future had to destroy the past didn\u2019t really make sense to me, among other things. It really feels like a cool idea that I don\u2019t think was presented right. In any case, nice try Nolan, not your best work. I\u2019d never tell him to slow it down or try to make something that isn\u2019t exactly what he wants to make, but I think the best version of Nolan is one who has his grand ideas reigned in a little bit.", "Someone needs to be fired for the credits not rolling backwards.", "dang didn't realize Mahir was Himesh Patel, he was great in Yesterday", "Now I remember why I prefer to watch films with subs on.", "Anyone else's ears still ringing?", "cant wait to watch this with subtitles lol", "I'll actually watch this again, but it will be at home where I can pause, rewind, use subtitles, draw sketches and whatever else I can do to try and completely understand exactly what is happening.  I'll probably spend hours just on the scene where Sator and the Protagonist are on opposite sides of the blue and red rooms.  That shit had my brain screaming for mercy.", "This movie solely exists because no studio is ever going to say \"No\" to Christopher Nolan given his track record. \n\nWhile it's probably my least favorite Nolan film by a long shot, it's still a fine watch, just from a spectacle POV. However it's 100% peak Nolan being way too into himself. If any other director pitched this concept, studio's would be like \"hard pass\".\n\nAlso, the idea that Nolan signed off on the sound-mixing in this film is so appalling lol. It's a movie where you need to hear every line of dialogue to understand the concepts being thrown around. The fact that you can't understand most of what's being said is so mind blowing to me.", "This is the first Nolan film I left the screening feeling largely dissatisfied, and I really wish that wasn't the case.\n\nThe actual idea for the movie, narratively speaking, is genuinely great. And when we got our first major inversion scene on the motorway I was pumped for what I thought would be the whole movie again in reverse, with clues paid off, emotional turning points, and a satisfying finale.\n\nThere was some of that, kind of... but the whole movie was just so unclear and dull leading up to that point that I didn't even care by the time the fun stuff started. The sound mixing issue has already been spoken about at length, but I honestly think Tenet makes a strong case for why some films actually need test screenings. I think WB seeing that 99% of the audience had a problem with the audio would have raised some major red flags with them.\n\nI also think it's weird for a film that asks you 'not to think about' the internal logic that it spends almost an hour devoted to nothing but explanations. Fast cutting does not make a scene any more interesting when you're just being assaulted with emotionless exposition. I think the cast really salvaged this experience for me, JDW and RP had a fun back and forth, and I even found the sheer absurdity of Branagh to be quite fun at times. It also seems Nolan has promoted the dead wife character to an alive abused wife character instead, so that's progress for him I guess?\n\nAll that said I feel like people will give Tenet quite a hard time (myself included) because Nolan has set the bar so damn high for himself. For any other filmmaker the flaws of this film could easily be thought of as its charms, and perhaps they will in time, but it's hard not to feel bitter fresh out the theatre. It actually made me miss the lack of dialogue in Dunkirk.", "Mind = blown. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sator_Square", "the fact that they were able to film a scene with characters going in two different temporal directions is insane to me", "I don't have much to add that people haven't already talked about other than that it is now very clear why Pattinson's character knew so much about Protagonists drink order when they met.", "The \"buy me dinner first\" line was pure cringe. Nolan really just played it straight.", "I feel so conflicted about this movie. I enjoyed it a lot! But I also feel like I have no idea what the hell happened.

I guess I need to watch it again?", "I will need to see it one or two more times. What an absolute mindfuck.

Breath of fresh air when it comes to cinematography and after watching so many unoriginal movies this lockdown.", "I like the idea that you have to literally travel through time instead of jumping to a time. But the whole oxygen thing threw me of a bit. It basically means that if you want to travel 20 years to the past, you would have to have an oxygen supply for that, right?", "Didn't like this movie, I'm sure a big part is because I had mile-high expectations going into this one.\n\nCould not follow the dialogue at key moments, the archetype of this being the opening action sequence in the opera, when most of the lines are given through a Bane-type mask.\n\nCould not follow the chain of causality because I could not understand what was going on due to inability to understand the dialogue.  I would have gleaned as much from the movie's plot had the movie been muted.  \n\nCould not follow the chain of causality because the core premise of the movie seems to be that there is no chain of causality.\n\nLoved Elizabeth Debicki in this, Robert Patterson was pretty good, John David Washington was pretty good as a Denzel-type Equalizer CIA agent, but IMHO such a character felt starkly out of place amongst a bunch of Brits in what is better compared to a James Bond type movie than anything American.  Michael Caine is IMHO too much of a presence in most Christopher Nolan movies to be effective in a cameo role, case in point is how he's ranked higher in the list of cast members than the main villain of the movie, even though he has maybe 5% the screen time.\n\nPacing was frenetic, and in a movie like this, that's a problem.  This movie has a lot of elements of a blockbuster action thriller, and Christopher Nolan's signature focus on novel themes and approaches.  Unfortunately these two elements are naturally at odds with each other, as a blockbuster action thriller's main draw is that you shut your brain off (think Transformers), whereas most Nolan movies require a strong attention span.  Inception walked this tightrope extremely well.  TeneT on the other hand fell way too far into the Transformers type pacing.\n\nAction was superb, the premise is very interesting, but IMHO the execution reminded me too much of the Dark Knight Rises, which I've liked less and less to the point of outright dislike for many of the same problems TeneT has.", "I went to an 8:30 showing and the kid who worked there must\u2019ve thought nobody was in the theater because he turned off all the screens and left with 20 minutes left in the movie.

I was beyond excited when the movie started and thought it would be a bit like Inception.   \n\n\nThe issue was and maybe it's just me that struggled with this. I found the plot quite difficult to follow. There were really cool action scenes but I struggled to understand the film as a whole. The characters certainly didn't help. I didn't feel connected or attached to any of them and the screenwriting didn't really feel like it was engaging. I'll probably give it another shot as I'm reading here that once you've seen it once the film makes more sense.   \n\n\nPersonally, I don't know if I just couldn't even comprehend this type of film and maybe it isn't for me for that reason or if there are actually things in it that don't make sense. The jump cutting and changing between locations also seemed very difficult to feel cohesive. Maybe it's just not for me but I'm curious to hear similar/differing opinions.", "The Biggest Logic Fail is this:-\n\nThe future humans have decided to kill the present humans & reverse what present humans did to the planet.\n\nThey believe that by doing so, it won't affect their existence (Grandfather Paradox) or even if they're not sure, they still want to take chance as their life is already fked up as Earth in the future is not so habitable.

Once they activate the Algorithm, the past humans will be destroyed and the Future humans too will cease to exist instantly because they killed their ancestors and henceforth cannot have been born.\n2.

Ended up loving it. Don't know if it's up there with Inception, for me, but it's pretty close. I enjoyed figuring things out as they went along and didn't really have a hard time understanding the time manipulation. It was like a game trying to put the pieces together of what was going to come back later. The lady diving off the yacht? Same woman who saw the lady diving off it. Neil stops mid chase after pulling the mask off the antagonist? Because he realized it's the protagonist. In the siege scene when the Protagonist gets saved by an inverted bullet?

The movie is slow in parts, the editing Frankensteinian, and the accents all shades of bad - flaws percolating from the script up and no amount of reshoots was going to fix that. However, I can see the superpowered horror film they were aiming for and enough of that is conveyed to make for an okay movie. If simply released on it\u2019s original release date, this easily could have taken money from something like Rampage and even bit into A Quiet Place a little just on the fact of being a Marvel property. \n\nMaybe Fox/Disney (whoever commissioned the final cut) thought that there was a way to bring out the better film that is trapped within the mess, but all their obvious editing just worked to suppress the one interesting angle this movie had.

Some horror scenes from the trailer (like the scene where hands and heads come out of the wall to attack Moonstar) never made it into the movie.\n\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy was a joy as Magik (pun intended) and her fight against the Demon Bear was badass. She needs to be Magik in the MCU.", "There were extremely abrupt changes in tone and pace - you can tell a lot of stuff was excised with nothing to replace it - but it was still a very good movie and the novelty of finally seeing it after all this time added to the fun. It's actually a bummer that they didn't cut the director loose to make it full horror like he wanted, my only other gripe besides the editing is just that it kind of doesn't know what type of movie it wants to be. I'm sad we won't be seeing any more stories from this group, it would have been interesting to see what they did a second time around after finding their stride.", "anyone wanna talk about the use of Buffy in it? i felt like the tara and willow kiss was foreshadowing. and the demons from Hush were similar to the smile creepy things.", "I refuse to believe this movie actually released.

Sam, Illyana, and Roberto are a really cool trio. I wish it had more horror elements, I feel like that\u2019s what the trailers were selling, but overall, it was fine.

Not much of a plot to speak of outside of the setup, but the characters were interesting enough and slightly darker and more hardcore than your average X-Men fair. \n\nThe character drama wasn't amazing. Everyone had pretty run-of-the-mill backstories. I killed my family, my town, my abusers, etc. What brought it home was some solid performances all around. Kind of a shame this release got dicked around so much because I'd imagine if it came out 2.5 years ago when anyone gave a shit about GoT or Stranger Things it could have found a solid audience. \n\nOverall not bad. I think something X-Men movies in general go light on is the bonkers potential of powers so it was pretty cool to see the giant spirit bear fuck shit up and Anya really kick some ass. It was very Breakfast Club/Shining and the horror tones were done pretty well, even though the movie felt kind of pasted together with ADR and choppy scene cuts abound. \n\nI'd give it a light 7/10 just because it's something I'd like to see the X-Men movies go in the direction of.

The rumours of pickup shoots to make it more scary would've definitely benefitted the film because it really shines in the horror scenes (laundry room/tunnels, the priest in shower, smiley guys).

The only character I thought was wasted was the guy from Stranger Thing's country character.  Every other character had a personality and I was genuinely interested in their stories. Magik stole the show for me and I was hoping she'd bring up Colossus but it didn't happen. It wasn't really a scary movie but it has you sucked in some parts.

It has invincible perfect plot armor until the scriptwriter decided it doesn't and then ta-da everything is solved.  \n\nI do think the film would have been very well-served by reshoots if just to make the dialogue sensible.  It's not a bad movie, but there's a better movie to be had with probably about 5 minutes worth of revised lines.

Watered down in production by the studio, which then planned reshoots to bring it back into line with the original vision because of another horror movie that did well (It), reshoots being delayed, and then a corporate buyout where the movie was inherited by a studio that didn't want anything to do with it, with no reshoots done and the movie awkwardly edited into something releasable. And all the while the two studios being indecisive with exactly how it fit into their franchise plans, because of course corporate synergy matters more than having the confidence and faith to produce something exciting or interesting.\n\nThis was a movie that was compromised over and over into there was nothing left, and the result isn't a movie that's outright *bad* but instead plagued with a profound, deep mediocrity that just soaks into every bit of the movie. It comes through in the filmmaking (I was shocked how flat and dry the photography was in the earlier stretches of the movie; it looked more like a network TV show than a superhero movie), awkward editing, the cast (Anya Taylor-Joy is the only one who \"pops\", and Alice Braga's extraordinarily dull villain does a ton of damage by making it hard to get into the drama or tension), the story hints at dark things but never commits to them in a satisfying way, the horror elements are intermittent and unconvincing, and so on and so on. Just mediocre right down to the bones.\n\nI'm not saying this would have been brilliant if Boone was able to do what the movie was originally supposed to be, but how could it have a chance when it got passed around and tinkered with and handicapped for *years*?

Why was this in limbo for so long?", "Not the worst movie of them all, but it's flawed. Very, flawed, starting from its characters.\n\nThere will be spoilers, but here we go:\n\n>!For a movie which has just 5 characters, they really had to their best to make them this flat; I'm not talking about how the character changes their behaviour randomly during the movie, neither I am talking about how some of them are not given enough space to even exist: I'm talking about the fact that we don't know shit about those character. !<\n\n>!Rahne: she was one of the characters with more screen time, but she was uninteresting to say the least; all we know about her is that she is very religious and that the reverendo of her church used to beat her since she is a mutant. We don't know anything else besides that she likes Dani and that she can transform into wolf. She knows perfectly how to travel through the pipes, but this fact is used just ONCE in the movie.!<\n\n>!Illyana: this character was amazing, but I would have loved to see her getting even more screen time, because nothing is told us about what her power really is or what those smiley things she is so scared of really are. She talks a lot to her puppet (who randomly transform into a small dragon for no reason at all), yet we are not told why she does it. Was it to cope with the fear of those smiles? Was it because she had no friends? We will never know!<\n\n>!Sam: this character had not enough screen time to be able to say something about him. He is completely flat, and while we know he is a kind person, we don't know shit about him. I suppose his arm broke due to his lack of control over his power, but this does not seem the case considering he bolts through several walls without injuring himself.!<\n\n>!Roberto: if Sam had not enough screen time to develop his character, Roberto had even less. He changes his behaviour randomly during the movie, his power is unclear (can he throw fireballs? is he more resistant while using fire? Why is there no fire in the last fight?) and we don't know anything about him.!<\n\n>!Dr. Reyes: evil doctor who wants the main character to be assassins. No backstory is given about her except for a small flashback. Her power is not well defined, but it looks like she can create wacky force fields.!<\n\n>!Dani: the reason this movie failed, and the reason this movie won't have a sequel to cover up the previous issues. She is a character with too much screen time, which still has no personality and with a power so unbalanced and ridicolous that it completely ruins every chance for the movie to get a sequel; while every other character has its own limitations and its own weaknesses, she can transform people's fears into reality. Let's just hope she never meets someone who is scared of zombies, or WW3, or any other thing that could destroy the world.!<", "Dear god, the fucking dialogue in this movie.................\n\nI'd give this about a 5/10. A few of the characters were decent, a few were dull. The score was about as non memorable as it gets. The script was sloppy as hell. The overall tone of the movie was bizarre.

I'd put it above the worst Xmen films (Wolverine Origins, Apocalypse, Xmen 3) but below the next tier up.", "I quite enjoyed it. Teenage emotions in a movie with teenagers was no shock to me but I personally think it should have had the same amount of gore as Logan. Really good ideas with lackluster execution and too much camp but somehow the good ideas outweighed the frankensteined beginning of the film. I atleast wanted to see what happened. Far, far, far from the worst X-Men film, it's like the media forgets Origins and Apocalypse exist.\n\nOther than bad accents, I prefer 21CFox's approach to diversity and I believe it was decided pre disney to have a lesbian couple.", "I've seen the movie yesterday and I was very let down. \nI know all the comics, and I loved - I honestly LOVED - the New Mutants-Series. Maybe that's why the movie was such a let-down for me. I maybe expected too much. \n\nFirst of all: I really liked Magik. The girl playing her did a nice job (even if her hairstyle changed randomly throughout the movie), but her attitude was really fitting this charakter. I liked her smile, the way she moved, it felt good. But I was pissed about the hand puppet. \nI mean come on, Lockheed is a real dragon, an alien to be exact, and not a puppet. That he had his debut in another spinoff than he actually originated from is - well - okay I guess, but the way he did was making me kinda angry. \nHe originally debuted in \"Excalibur\" as Shadowcat's companion, and befriended various characters later (with them also Magik IIRC, but even if not they would go very well together). It's just, why he had to be a puppet? With this also there's way to little explanation why Magik even had him - or about her powers anyways. I exactly know all the stuff about her, but my husband who accompanied me and never was reading the comics knew nothing about her and was left absolutely puzzled about her. \n\nNext thing, Wolfsbane. I love Wolfsbane! She's my absolute favourite charakter in the whole X-Men-Franchise and I hoped for years and years she would get a debut in the movies. And then \"THIS\" happend. \nThere where plenty forced looks into her \"wolf eyes\" (that weren't her eyes when she got in wolf form, but well what do I know), her father wasn't her father any longer (her Name is Rahne Sinclair, and her fathers name is Reverend Craig Sinclair, he's her father in all the comics and spinoffs, except for this one I guess), and even her wolf form had the wrong color. In all the comics she's a huge RED wolf, but okay. It's not easy finding a specific colored wolf (or wolf dog), especially if it would've to be pure red. \nAll this things I maybe COULD accept, if they hadn't made the most christian and straightest character in the whole franchise a homosexual all of a sudden. \nDon't get me wrong, I'm all pro LGBT, but Rahne Sinclair just isn't lesbian. She's strictly straight, even preaching to various charakters throughout the comics that they'll go to hell because of their homosexuality - and now they made HER homosexual? Come on.... (That maybe angered me the most tbh)\n\nDani Moonstar had way too much screentime for her flat character, I don't get how she should be the lead character for a trilogy. She felt so empty I don't even can write much about her. \nI get why they choose her for a gf for Rahne, they shared a deep bond in the comics too, but the same as for Rahne, Dani never showed any ambitions/love interests for girls. (Also I missed the winged horse, but that's another story I guess :P ).\n\nRoberto and Sam where all right, but they should've gotten more screentime. Never in the movie it where mentioned that Sam had plenty of siblings and had to work instead going to school because of this (also most of his siblings are Mutants, too, but I get why they didn't mentioned that, it would have been way to much to cover). \nIf you don't know the characters already you don't get Sams or Robertos Powers at all, they're never explained. Illyana herself says she's magic and that is her power, Rahne transforms to a wolf, can see in the dark and smell very good (in the comics she can also lift a car with one hand - that's also why it was so stupid to me that she needed help to carry Dani to the chapel :P ) and also is telling this. Danielles \"Nightmare Powers\" are seeping through the whole movie, you kinda just have to get it. But with Sam and Roberto? Nah, they're just \"there\" so it isn't just a movie about three strange chicks it felt.\n\nAll in all the movie felt kinda weak. I didn\u2019t liked it and I wont recommend it to anyone. Not to the fans because they will be dissapointed, and not to the \u201anot-fans\u2018 because they wont get half the stuff that happens. :(", "Saw this last night at a drive in, honestly it was pretty enjoyable. \n\n\nMy main complaint is that it felt really rushed and I think it could have done with more \"Breakfast Club\" style scenes and moments of lightheartedness, of which there were only a few, and it could have done with a lot more development of the characters. We get their backstory and basic character traits and only Moonstar, Raine, and Ilia got more development than that, and it still wasn't enough really. All the other characters were very underdeveloped but they were still good enough in their scenes. \n\n\nThe horror also was lackluster, more just creepy than horrific or terrifying, but it's only PG-13 so they couldn't have done much. \n\n\nOverall it was enjoyable, had some real emotion and heart (even if a lot of that emotion and heart was rushed) and had an engaging plot, and the action at the end was pretty good, though the actual end was kinda lackluster. Not a bad film at all though and I'll definitely rewatch it on VOD.", "Holy shit, I actually got to see New Mutants, I kinda don't believe it. I liked it too. Wish it came out sooner, wish it had a sequel already, wish we had deadpool 3 and x-force with some of these characters. It was solid.", "Was just a very nothing movie. Not awful, but very boring for the better half of it. Definitely not the worst x-men movie as some have been saying.", "Holy *shit* that movie sucked.  Bad writing, forgettable acting, bad, bad, bad accents, the pacing was nonsense, rife with tropes, - no surprises, nothing made sense, The CGI was good, and the bear looked particularly cool, but Jesus.  What a way to go for the Fox-owned X-men.  \n\nNow to figure out if it's better to watch something that might suck because the bar is so low, or something good to get this *taste* out of my mouth.", "I expected a dumpster fire but I'm a sucker for X-Men movies and keep hoping they'll strike that X2 gold again at some point.  It wasn't the shitshow I thought it would be but it wasn't great. It just basically... is a movie. Not bad enough to shit on but not good enough to praise, IMO. Very thoroughly a YA adventure movie- plop a 12-15 year old down in front of it and they'll probably come away jazzed. \n\nThe story is bookended well by the Native American parable (I googled around for a couple minutes and this is apparently a real fable though it's usually said to be about Two Wolves) and I give them kudos for that main character as well as making her a lesbian. Normally the love interest for these just becomes \"which [cute boy](https://youtu.be/kyx1U9QjWVQ) will she end up with?\" so that was nice to have some different representation, but it could also be seen as ticking Diversity Checkboxes depending on your level of cynicism. \n\nThe accents were all over the place and I had to strain belief a little bit about the supposed Brazilian national who sounds like he was raised in SoCal. But the acting, like the whole affair was essentially...there? Like, it existed. Can't deny that.\n\nThe horror segments were ok, but I would have liked them played up which was a big part of the development hell. I was disappointed in the poor CGI at times, especially of Illya's thin men. I couldn't help but think \"damn, Doug Jones would have been perfect for this.\" It's an X-Men movie so yeah, there's gonna be CG, but that could have been a great moment for creepy practical effects. \n\nAh well, X2 it wasn't. I guess that's the end of the Fox legacy, right? Maybe Marvel will strike gold with mutants.\n\nedit: I forgot I meant to mention there were lots of moments where I noticed poor editing which doesn't surprise me with the behind-the-scenes troubles. Lots of establishing shots missing, poor continuity, etc. But this was mostly early on and I didn't notice it once the story got moving faster.", "New mutants is such a strange movie. The good parts are genuinely good but the bad parts are abysmally bad.", "I actually kinda enjoyed it.", "Movie was pretty bad. They shouldn't have taken so long to develop the horror aspect and the resolution shouldn't have been as easy as calming the bear. What they should have done was have the horror part start at the beginning and made the doctor a scary character. Final boss should have been Mr Sinister. The movie ended up having no bad guy/villan at all.   The blond actress was the worst bad person turned good  character ever  too. Her acting was atrocious. If I have to say one good thing about the movie is that the music was amazing.", "I didn't wanna risk my life going to see this at the movies then and after watching it I'm glad I stuck with that decision. \ud83d\ude02 Best part of the movie was the girl who played Illyana. She had the look and personality of the character to a tee. \n\nIf this is the last Fox made Marvel movie, Kevin Feige can't go anywhere else but up with the X-Men franchise.", "It was Dream Warriors in the X-Man universe. Which is cool, I felt the issues though in the film and that sucked. Also no talks of continuing it on have been made, it was supposed to be a trilogy with the next two being horror films (alien invasion/sci-fi, and apocalyptic horror). I was totally in for that ride of superhero films. All in all, Magik was dope but she almost carried the movie. I wish they would have went more into psychotic disorders like survivor's guilt with Cannonball, PTSD for Sunspot, abuse/Stockholm for Wolfsbane with her religion, trauma for Mirage and Magik (since these two opposed each other a lot, it would be cool to draw comparison with linking issues in different ways ie, Magik talking to Lockheed and Dani/Mirage having nightmares). This being without Dani's powers causing it all, just amplifying it when she arrives.  \n\n\nIt would have fleshed out a much better story instead of a weak version of what I just talked about. Demon-Bear was a horrible final villain but it's linked to Dani. They could have taken a page from Scarlett Witch and allowed her to bend reality and cause Reyes to appear as a strong enemy than she actually is based off Dani's perception of her... but I digress.  \n\n\nIt was okay, a better ending to the X-Men universe than Dark Phoenix but definitely a let-down. I just hope it gets it's sequels and they let the director have his vision without interference.", "I liked it.  It was nothing groundbreaking, but it wasn't bad.  I'm glad that it finally came out and we finally got these characters somewhere other than the comics.  I'm pretty sure 2/3 of the characters in the movie haven't been in any visual medium, maybe not even games.", "Eh, it's alright. I thought most of everything that the film had (score, writing, directing, and cinematography) had a positive and negative to it with the exception of the young cast who all did a pretty good job with what they had. \n\nIt wasn't very scary but they did have some nice setups for certain scares (there was one in particular that could've been very creepy) but they never capitalized on it. The editing was pretty off-putting with weird cuts and just certain scenes that could've had a lot more detail to them. \n\nIt sucks too because I don't think Boone did an outright terrible job with this and maybe given a better budget with a better script, this would've been better. If it was still 2017 and it came out exactly as it did, I would wish for a sequel but that's never going to happen.\n\nSucks because the cast isn't that bad, especially Maise Williams, Charlie Heaton, and Anya Taylor Joy especially. I also think that while not very new with its ideas, it doesn't do a terrible job at showing it and it leaves on a pretty nice note with some decent shots at the end too. \n\nOverall, I wish this film was more then what we got. If it was given a better script and an overall more interesting premise, I think it could've been more effective at setting up something. So while I didn't find it that interesting or scary (being in the empty movie hallways and theaters were scarier) but it did have that potential and it was sadly wasted.", "I actually really liked this movie, probably because I didn't have any expectation since I haven't read much of New Mutants but still enough to know some characters.\n\nYou can really feel a change of pace some point in the movie imo, where it goes from rather slow and more horror to action-packed with cheesy catchphrases. The characters development felt rushed but they were interesting, and I'm happily surprised to have seen Illyana on the big screen.\n\nIt's too bad it's not connected to the MCU because I really liked the characters (and their actors).", "I saw New Mutants Friday and...it\u2019s not that bad. I mean it\u2019s not great. Personally I\u2019ve been looking forward to this since the Animatic leaked. I\u2019ve been following the development of this film since it\u2019s inception so I know about all the deleted scenes and theme changes. The changes definitely shows with this movie...it oddly reminds me of Justice League or rather Zack Snyder\u2019s Sucker Punch. I appreciated the LGBT leads even if it didn\u2019t develop super well. The action and power displays were pretty cool...I just wish we got more context for some of their powers if you\u2019re not already an X-Men fan some might confuse you. Magik in particular (who was played excellently Anya Taylor Joy) basically can teleport and summon a magik sword and dragon...why couldn\u2019t she just teleport away. Maybe Reyes is immune to her powers because she was able to protect Dani from Illyana\u2019s sword. This would have been way better if they fully leaned into the action horror movie they originally wanted to do. Oh and I guess since I\u2019m black I have to address Sunspots casting....I think he should have been darker skinned...no I\u2019m not angry the actor did a good job but I don\u2019t think he quite nailed Roberto as a character. I liked how it tied into Logan DOFP and DP 2 without beating you over the head with it...if others hadn\u2019t mentioned it I would have never connected the dots unless I rewatched the movies all within a set time frame. This was so rambly...like this movie. TL;DR This movie is a 6.5/10 it feels like the X-Men movie we should have got Ten Years Ago...fun fight scenes.", "I loved the shit out of this movie. Not enough to be blinded by its many, many flaws though. In step with the general consensus I gave it a 6/10, but I can like a movie even if it isn't amazing. As with most here, I praise Anna's acting as Magik. Personally, as my favorite comic book character of all time, I think she did the role justice. But the plot's confused, the inclusion of some elements (Lockheed in particular) just don't make sense, and the overall tone of the film shifts between horror, teen romance, and action a little too much. Now let's be fair here, a genre mashup like this is hard to get right and I feel if it were in the hands of someone during a more stable production cycle it would have ended up being a lot better. But I'm going to end up watching it multiple times in the future, most likely, because I'm weird that way.", "I  guarantee their will be a re examaing of this film in 5 years and will maybe find a cult audience.

Also how are people praising Anna Taylor-Joy? She had the worst Russian accent in the world and it took me out of the movie because you kept hearing her struggle with it.

He should have pushed against Dani at least a little. The way they did it, she could have just said 'no' from the beginning. \nIllyana's story was suggestive of human trafficking and that's a real life horror, including it in a movie like this is disrespectful.\nMay have been crossing the line into cultural appropriation with the Cheyenne storyline. I know the original comic writers just wanted to be inclusive but I don't know enough about their culture to tell if it was respectful or not. The accents were terrible (except the people who used their native accents) \n\nThings I loved\nThe design of Illyana's demons was fierce\nThe lesbian relationship was done extremely tastefully.\nAll the mutant powers had great graphics, they felt really great, Wolfbane's transformations, sunspot, cannonball, e.t.c\n\nThe things I would have changed were minor details.

In some ways, yes, in other ways not quite. If you're happy to see both Bill and Ted together trying to recapture the attitude they had in the first two movies, they sort of half-succeed at doing it, despite feeling a little awkward at them being way older now. There are some good jokes that land, but its pretty much close to impossible to recreate the magic of the first two films if you ask me. It's definitely my least favourite of the three.\n\nThat being said, Face the Music is a very easy watch and does have cool references that old fans will appreciate and notice. I wasn't the biggest fan of their daughter characters taking up almost the same amount of screentime as Bill and Ted personally, so whenever it was just them two it kind of lost me for a few minutes with them trying so hard to act like Bill and Ted. I did like the new robot character though and of course seeing old characters reappear and take part again.

I rewatched both originals the past 2 days and had a lot of fun. This last was was still fine to watch as it continued something I enjoyed but it lacked the same magic. Easily goes Bogus > Excellent > 2020 for me and it's not close.  \nMany people hate on the girls for the 'twist' that they're the new Bill and Ted, but I just didn't enjoy their acting. I like Samara in everything I've seen her in but I couldn't tell you a single memorable thing she did and I literally just finished. And while I only know Ted's daughter actor from Atypical where I'm a huge fan, her acting style was my least favorite part of this movie.  \nPart of the charm for me of the original was just these young actors in this cheap film feeling really natural and wholesome. Now it's seasoned actors and 2020 special effects that felt like they were trying to be cheap and goofy on purpose which ruined it for me. Love Keanu and he killed it in the first 2 movies and dozens of roles since, but he was probably my 2nd least favorite part.

Really nice touch", "Is this movie fun and easyish to understand without having seen the others?", "Just finished watching it! The movie totally lived up to the premise of the plot and the entire trilogy. This was a most EXCELLENT movie. Absolutely recommended!", "I absolutely loved this movie.

At that moment I think John would have welcomed reality coming to an end.", "Okay, it's pretty sweet, but am I the only one shocked by how terrible it looked? Both the digital look and the cinematography were so unimaginative and lacked any sort of vibrancy and energy. I watched it after Bogus Journey, which is just an amazing achievement visually, and this was just incredibly bland in comparison.", "It takes about 20 minutes to really get going, but once it does, it's fantastic and hilarious. Anthony Carrigan once again steals every single scene he is in. *My name is Dennis Caleb McCoy.*", "I'd be fine with the Bill & Ted franchise continuing with the two girls.  That's how much I love this comedy.\n\nBilly & Thea's Excellent Adventures", "I have a lot to say about it, and I guess this is the right place to do it. I'm a huge fan of the originals; they were a big part of my childhood. I knew it was going to be hard to recapture the magic 29 years later, but it was totally better than expected.\n\nI like that they addressed all the continuity at the beginning of the film (the biggest one being that the \"sons\" at the end of Bogus were actually daughters). I liked that we got to see Missy and Deacon and Ted's father again. I didn't really like that they retconned most of the future headlines at the end of Bogus, which made them out to be a way bigger deal than is ever acknowledged in this movie.\n\nIt was cool that Billie and Theodora got to have their own Excellent Adventure and travel back in time, bagging famous musicians. I can buy Jimmy Hendrix, Louis Armstrong and Mozart, but I still have no idea who the other two historical figures were. And why is Kid Cudi somehow an expert in quantum mechanics and such a significant part of this? These parts didn't feel as fun as Excellent Adventure did, but I appreciate the fan service. In addition, I feel like they sold the Bogus Journey part short; from the marketing materials, I thought there would be more William Sadler in it. It was great that we got what we did, but it was a much smaller part of the movie.\n\nI have to address the princesses here. They go on their own voyage through time, but we don't really see much of the purpose of this. Also, it's weird that they cast the babes to be so much younger here (I know they were played by different actresses in every film). I think it was also mentioned in Bogus Journey that they were supposed to be a part of the song that saved everything, but I guess that can be explained away by Billie & Thea being the actual \"chosen ones\" here. (It's funny how much of this future Rufus omitted from them.)\n\nAll the other stuff is just kind of weird. When they visit their future selves, they're too drastically different in personality and temperament (29 years later, they're exactly the same, but only 2 years later, they're conmen and liars?). At one point, future Bill even tries to shoot them, which makes no sense because it would have ended their own lives (the buffed-out prison versions actually acknowledge this). The weird thing is that all the future incarnations are aware of the time traveling duo visiting them, which means all this stuff still has to happen in order to maintain continuity.\n\nThe music to save the world (or whatever) certainly wasn't as iconic as the pieces chosen in the first two films, \"In Time\" or \"God Gave Rock 'N' Roll to You.\" The idea that everyone plays instruments and that somehow restores order in the universe (and all the displaced time fragments) doesn't make a lick of sense to me, as sweet a sentiment as that is. I was kind of hoping for a coda to see Bill & Ted one last time, and while it was nice to see the retirement home versions of them jam out, I still didn't feel like I got enough closure at the end of the film. Especially since this is most likely the final bow.\n\nI'm complaining a lot, but these are my initial reactions after watching the film. It wasn't bad; it was fun and weird. Excellent Adventure will always be the holy grail.\n\nEdit: This is the 69th comment. Excellent! *\\*guitar riff\\**", "This was probably the best possible outcome one could hope for in a sequel 30 years after the last one. I really enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie when they were hopping through time, the last third fizzled between hell and the finale. I get the point that they were going for (\"it wasn't the song that made the difference, it was everyone playing it together\") but I really wanted a face-melting 80s/90s inspired song instead of a generic pop tune.", "Loved it. Had way more belly laughs than I expected. I thought it'd be wildly fun, but Dennis and Death had some absurdly funny parts. I feel rejuvenated after. Make sure to watch past the credits.", "I liked it a lot. Perhaps it was nostalgia, who knows. A bright spot on this shitty year. Dennis Caleb McCoy was great.", "This movie made me smile and laugh. It was so positive, fuck I needed it. \nBe excellent to each other", "That was a very fun movie but that ending was way too abrupt", "I hated it, I loved it, It was wonderous and angelic and evil, a beautiful divine hell. \n\nI wanted to think the ending was dumb and silly and such a ridiculous cop out. \n\nBut I can't, that would imply I held the originals to the same standards and I was just a dumb kid. I'm glad I watched this.", "~~Still watching it! Only about 15 minutes in or so.~~\n\nJust saw Rufus!\n\nEDIT: Just finished it! Great movie :D\n\nEDIT2: ohshit\n\n#THERE IS A POST CREDITS SCENE!\n\n>!Involves old and decrepit Bill & Ted in the old folks care center. Pretty funny!<", "This movie is full of cartoony logic it's amazing. Wholesome atmosphere that made me think of the Lego Movie for some reason", "Finally, the timeless question has been answered and now we know Jesus Christ played the cowbell. \n\nI'm sure very few people were expecting this to be anywhere near as special as the originals but I have to say that I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It is still far from perfect or even necessary sometimes, but I didn't hate it. \n\nFirst thing I'll say is that I wasn't totally sold by the idea of the daughters doing impressions of their fathers. I think it would have been funnier if they belonged to a different exaggerated subculture. The Spiccoli/Bill and Ted thing feels outdated now, funny seeing them be dinosaurs but young people aren't like that anymore. I think it would have caused some funny tension if Bill and Ted loved their daughters but didn't quite understand them, much like their parents never understood Bill and Ted growing up. \n\nI also thought the ultimate twist of Logan/Preston being the daughters was both very predictable and almost unecessary. I saw it coming from the moment the future council mentioned the prophecy mentioned Logan/Preston and I think most people will. Which is odd because Bill and Ted still ended up playing lead in the big moment. Obviously the daughters were a pivotal part of that moment, but there's really no concrete reason to pull the last name twist since they were all there. \n\nI will also say that the performances of the past celebrities were all so much more forgettable and less fun than the originals. I mean you can't beat Napoleon at a waterpark or Socrates holding a baseball bat but it seems they didn't even try. Every one of them including the daughters were sharing screentime and not given a chance to shine, and I'm just gonna say it's a shame they didn't get someone who could also play guitar and piano for Hendrix and Mozart. So frustrating because that scene where they played together could have been so awesome if I wasn't distracted by the camera specifically not showing their hands. Remember the Hendrix knockoff in Across the Universe? That's what I wanted. \n\nOkay that feels really negative so here's the good stuff. Bill and Ted has a great message among the films, and that message is not only the importance of positivity but also the power of music to unite and the idea that rock music is what it all was leading to. On that note, I really enjoyed the ending of this movie. I thought the idea that it wasn't so much a song as a musical moment that transcended space and time was really awesome, even though most people wouldn't know what to do with a C Major scale to save reality. I wasn't jazzed that they felt the need to voiceover the point before the credits when they just showed us, but I really liked the scene and I liked the acknowledgement that coming up with the greatest song of all time to unite everyone was an impossible task. \n\nOverall, I'd say if you have an interest in watching this movie absolutely go for it. Taper your expectations and have fun where you can, specifically with Noho Hank as Dennis McCoy. If you don't care for the movies or have never seen them I wouldn't feel bad about passing. Solid 6/10.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "It was pretty fun at parts and it definitely did not suck, which is a great thing.\n\nFeels like a skeleton of a movie in hindsight, though. We're really only looking at about 80 minutes total and it ends too abruptly. I know Excellent Adventure more or less matches it in run time but this one doesn't feel as large.\n\nIt's a decent enough of a film but didn't quite hit on some levels. The weakest of the three Bill & Tedd movies but still okay.", "Biggest disappointment for me is that Bill and Ted aren't metalheads any more. They're just kind of generic.\n\nA lot of the fun of the originals was the idea that metal, which at the time was viewed by the mainstream as moronic and crass, would be the music that united the world. That was kind of the major joke of the series. \n\nThey've gone from name dropping Megadeth, Iron Maiden and Eddie Van Halen to Dave Grohl and Kid Cudi and that's a shame.", "It wasn\u2019t bad so much as it didn\u2019t land. Production values are a step-down from bogus journey. Bogus Journey had so many great set pieces- the mazes of hell, heaven, bill and Ted university, death\u2019s game room. \n\nIn \u201cface the music\u201d there was a lot of green screen in place of sets and art direction was a subpar. I rolled my eyes that a major scene was set in a very generic \u201crich  guy mansion.\u201d  I just couldn\u2019t buy into to the fantasy with the cheap-ish production values. Felt the movie was trying to have it both ways - in one hand it wanted to be post modern and eschew a big Hollywood style production but on the other hand the content of the script was an ultra safe, traditional approach to high fantasy. Idk these two approaches clashed and dampened my enjoyment of the film. The only fantasy stuff that really worked was Kevin Yagher\u2019s stunning makeup effects work.", "Honestly the whole film felt like an eyeroll for me, and I called the plotwist with the daughters \"taking lead\" since the original trailer. Obviously you can't beat the original, but this lacked any soul of the first two films and overall felt like a very awkward experience, like im supposed to care about the inclusion of dennis mccoy or kid cudi (like really? Why him?). i guess im supposed to be glad this is coming to an apparent end, albeit an unncessary one at that, but it didn't sit right with me.", "The moment the studio changed the kids from boys to girls, I already knew they were going to turn half the movie about them and that the ending would retcon the daughters into being the true writers of the song and bill and ted would just be there to say how much better they were than them.  Its sad this is so predictable in modern hollywood.", "Bill and Ted suffers from the same fate the latest Terminator movie did. We\u2019ve been told for years that a certain person is going to fulfill a prophecy and save the world but then it turns out it\u2019s a Mary Sue that is now going to save the day.", "I love the first two movies but I didn't like Face the Music. \n\nIt had a few laughs but the ending was predictable woke garbage. It strips away the accomplishments of the two main characters we've grown to know and love and tells us they're actually the accomplishments of two new female characters we just met. I liked Billie and Thea and would have liked to see them in their own movie, so this isn't an anti-feminism rant, it's more me being pissed off and insulted as a fan of Bill & Ted. \n\nThere are also some plot holes like Ted's dad being at the Battle of the Bands and arresting DeNomolous at the end of Bogus Journey, then witnessing B&T time travelling and suddenly re-appearing with two infants but then in this new film calling B&T delusional for suggesting they time travelled. He's not concerned that Billie and Thea just suddenly appeared in their lives? Also, the film ignores Missy wedding DeNomolous, but whatever.\n\nThe depiction of Hell in this new movie also bothered me. It was all  bland and boring green screen. Michael Keaton as a demon was funny but the depiction of Hell in Bogus Journey was incredibly well done, artsy and creative. I didn't feel that way at all about Face the Music.\n\nThe ending of the film seemed rushed as well. It's like they ran into time constraints and just slapped whatever footage they had together and went with it.\n\nMy favorite part of the movie was actually the robot. He delivered the best lines, IMO.\n\nOverall I would give it a 5/10. Most non-triumphant.", "Making the daughters the focus at the end was predictable and cynical; so many franchises do the whole \"passing the baton\" thing these days and it just feels so damn lazy. Not all viewers need \"family is everything\" truisms.\n\nApart from that the film was fun. Not amazing but a respectable follow-up for sure.", "Do not read the comments here if you have an chance of enjoying this movie. \n\nI am a huge fan of the originals, and it wasnt a horrible way to spend an hour and a half but it wasnt nearly as good as the comments here make it seem. \n\nPersonally I think little Bill was super annoying. She was over acting the entire time. Ted is really just a more (or possibly less) exaggerated character of Keanu Reeves. He couldnt help but act that way. She was trying way to hard to mimic it. It reminds me of Akwafina from Jumanji next level when she is trying to act like Danny Devito which ends up just sounding like an old jewish man for some reason. \n\nA lot of what we see is just cut away for jokes. I dont even understand why they go to hell, or why the robot is so weird. People are saying how much they love it but I thought it was kind of distracting. \n\nAlso thought the song at the end was horrible. \n\nThis was fun enough but honestly will be far more forgettable than the other movies were. They should have just made a movie about Bill and Ted being the heroes and made it simple. There was to much to keep track of.", "This movie was horrible. It wasn't even slightly funny or entertaining. It was bland, boring and fake. Bill and Ted weren't Bill and Ted and their \"daughters\" (which were boys in Bogus Journey) were absolutely cringe-worthy to watch.\n\nThere was no soul, no excitement, not even a smile throughout. It didn't even spark any feelings of nostalgia in me or my girlfriend, who both LOVED the first two.", "I can't believe what I\u2019m reading in this thread because this movie was absolutely terrible and soulless. Didn't make me laugh once, Keanu's performance is terrible, he looks so awkward and can't play Ted at all anymore. Alex Winter still does a good Bill but the movie just fucking sucks.", "Quick question to the people who praised the ending. Do you guys ever get tired of supporting horrible choices in story and casting just so you can run to Twitter and find the only black person you follow just to tell them you support racial diversity in movies?", "The movie was ass. I watched a recent interview w both of them and they spoke to how Bogus Journey was so original and didn't try to rehash the same thing for a cheap sequel and why that was important to the . I genuinely agreed with it and was very hopeful for this film. This movie did the complete opposite and did part 1 and 2 all over again. The daughters getting a band together for no apparent reason, going to hell, etc. kid cudi had no reason to be in this and didn't further the film at all. The movie dragged on for its entire runtime. Everybody shits on passing the torch movies but everyone is praising the two daughters who are  just doing their best bill and Ted impression. I really wanted to love this movie. Watched it with my nephew and had to apologize that this was his introduction to this franchise. Part 2 was such a wild ride and I was hoping we'd get that level of weirdness but this movie just played it safe w an extremely stale storyline.", "So it's not the most amazing thing ever, but it is fun. Death was a highlight for me once more. William Sadler didn't miss a beat. Alex Winter also really brought it again, if anything I feel Keanu was more subdued than anyone else.   \n\n\nBilly and Thea were fine. Everything felt very rushed and condensed with them though and I can't name a scene that has any staying power except maybe the finale which holy shit the movie just *ends* doesn't it? I would have liked a little more time to decompress Bill and Ted finally achieving what they set out to do over 30 years ago.   \n\n\nBut all that aside, my biggest gripe with the movie is my same gripe with almost every movie I've seen in the past couple of years - why does it look so shit? What's with the flat TV lighting, flat camera angles, flat everything? It looks so unimaginative. The only scene with a hint of it is when they're talking to death, but that felt more like \"oh we're in hell so we need some orange accent lighting\" than \"lets get weird with it.\". The heart is there in the movie and the writing, but it desperately desperately needed some vision to go along with it. Dean Parisot also made Galaxy Quest, which is arguably one of the greatest movies ever made and yeah, that's also a rather flat and boring film visually (until you get to some ILM vfx) but there's a LOT to be said for shooting on film with true anamorphic and some real genre lighting going on. This looks like they just shot the film with consumer camcorders on auto mode.   \n\n\nSome really imaginative twisted visuals would have gone a LONG way to making this film better.", "I hate this movie, first is Awesome dude, second is not so Awesome dude, third is Bogus dude.\n\nBill and Ted's Excellent Adventure: Excellent \ud83d\udc4f\n\nBill and Ted's Bogus Journey: Nice\ud83d\udc4d\n\nBill and Ted Face the Music: Bogus \ud83d\udc4e", "Bill and Ted Face the Retcon", "They went back in time to find a drummer and landed on \"random caveman\" in a movie that already has Dave Grohl in it.

But they still have to do it.\n\nSo timeline, our main boy is talking to RP giving him all the info, basically a time travel plot but before our main guy in the first timeline meets him. He doesn't tell him any of this in case things go differently and they don't know what'll happen if a person sees themselves from the future. I think someone mentioned an explosion of cells but I can't be sure.\n\nWhat's the point though? Like emotionally, I get it's to save the world, but if I can't see the consequences or direct result of pain that it causes people, then I can't connect, like there's nothing to hold on to. \n\nI like Robert Pattinson, didn't even catch he was called Neil. I like Elizabeth Debicki, but beyond a couple cliched abuse scenes, didn't feel too engaged. \n\nI really wanted to see the future, where people were sending things back in time, like at some point it's gonna kick into gear and we'll see JDW in the future or someone fighting just before the big apocalypse happens that y'know, causes the inversion.\n\nTheir friendship and that moment where JDW is tearing up at the end when he's gonna sacrifice himself, when I should be emotional instead I'm like;\n\n*'Oh yeah*, was that RPatz that got shot in the head in front of him at the end two seconds ago then?'\n\nIf they'd slowed down and given me that relationship in this film, all the moments I should have been seeing, then it'd have affected me more. \n\nIt's like making a film that you'll understand a second time, but it's like, why?\n\nInception had Cobb, Mal, a bit of humour through JGL and Tom Hardy, and even the emotion of Cillian Murphy, the villain and his Dad. A villain and his Dad had more emotional connect than most of this film for me. And that film still didn't have enough character moments for me, this one has fewer rather than the other way around.\n\nThis entire film should have been full of scenes like Robert Pattinson saying 'That part is a *little* bit dramatic', that relationship should be taking up the *entire* film, not sidelined by it.\n\nI really enjoyed the action stuff surrounding the fire and car chasing, and I do love the concept. It just didn't really have an emotional connect.\n\nIf a film is a running coach who's job is to teach you exposition of how to run alongside and also entertain and impress through their ability to run so you can both get to the finish line, then this one is a coach that runs farther ahead, shouts into the wind for you to keep up and then reaches it before you, and you never learned what you needed to to get proper running technique, and they never slow down, so you give up and walk home without your reaching the finish line.", "I genuinely have a headache after watching. Not because of plot complexity, but because I had to STRAIN to try and hear the dialogue. Still a fun movie but holy shit that sound mix was atrocious.", "I wouldn't say the time inversion plot is that difficult to understand in hindsight of the third act. What I was genuinely confused was motivation of most of the main characters, it all felt so superficial and bordering on parody at times. I think the acting was great all around considering the awful dialogue, but the actual plot which set this time shenanigans in motion was just not very well developed at all. \n\nAlso, I know this is Nolan's style, but the quick cuts between scenes with very little establishing shots really took me out of the movie a lot of times. \n\nThe ending \"battle\" looked like a paintball game. Who is fighting who?\n\nI have to think about this a bit more, but I'm not sure I'd say this was anything amazing.", "To everyone who speaks English as their first language.\n\nEver wanted to know what English sounds like to someone who does not speak it?

I get that fun isn\u2019t Nolan\u2019s thing, but even the big action scenes weren\u2019t terribly compelling. Like at the end with the teams of soldiers just shooting at everything I couldn\u2019t even tell who the bad guys were half the time/where the protagonists were trying to go.

There\u2019s basically nobody to root for, or get attached to as everyone is little more than a walking exposition spouting robot. Sort of makes the \u2018world is ending\u2019 stakes feels pretty irrelevant. \n\nThe set pieces and incredibly cinematic craftsmanship really carry it, but the needlessly overdressed plot and the emotional coldness really dent the film. \n\nOh and the audio mixing fucking suuuucks, like to the point where I would actually recommend you only watch this if you can get it with subtitles.", "I simply love Nolans opening sequences.", "One thing I haven't seen discussed is the actual use of the word Tenet in the movie. It's explained to The Protagonist that it will open essentially a new world to him. Good doors and bad. But then he uses it like twice and it's never mentioned again. I really thought that was going to play a bigger part of the plot.", "Some thoughts:\n- Sweet fuck the sound mixing is bad.\n- I feel like this movie needed to get an Inception type of rewrite.

The Prestige might be my favorite movie. With that said, Tenet was disappointing. It's not a bad movie, but it's just not very good. The plot is convoluted. The explanations don't make that much sense, and aren't concise - something I felt was quite well done in Interstellar for example. \n\nIt feels like a waste of an idea really. Somehow the movie feels rushed. The dialogue is poor. The romance seems quite forced. There is no great twist to uncover and for attentive viewers most of the smaller twists are obvious.\n\nThat said, there are two scenes in particular which I felt were cinematically interesting and well done - the fight with his reverse self and the building retro-exploding and exploding again. It felt like THAT was what the movie should be exploring. \n\nThere's something that bothers me about Nolan. He is obviously quite an intelligent man with clever ideas, and I will always applaud his audacity and I hope he keeps exploring Time as a movie concept. But WHY do we have to keep going to standard movie tropes? Why do we keep having to have guns, and bullets, and explosions? Ever since Inception it feels like he MUST include those things in his movies, and I ask why? Can you imagine the ideas that could've been explored in Inception if the bad guys weren't idiots with guns? Tenet itself could've been a much more interesting movie if we didn't have to resort to this kind of army propaganda. Honestly as I was watching the movie I wondered if there's a studio exec reason behind this. Is it possible that for him to keep having big budgets he must include this common denominator of action-movie tropes? Or is that his preference? I just don't know. The Prestige didn't need this bullshit. Nor did Memento. Nor did Interstellar, and they're all great movies. \n\nAh well, Tenet wasn't bad. Just a waste of a good idea on an average execution in my opinion.", "When Neill said \u201cOne day maybe I\u2019ll tell you my life story\u201d somehow I came up with the theory that he was Kat and Andrei\u2019s son who had come from the future in order to prevent the end of the world and was the mastermind behind \u201cTenet\u201d", "Anyone around here remember that scene with the cheese grater?

It tried way too hard to be complex and the time traveling gimmick could have been explored better. It seemed to me as if it was intentionally convoluted just because this is what one expects from a Nolan flick.\n\nThe characters were bland and underdeveloped. Every time the movie tried to pack an emotional punch, it fell flat for me. Moreover, most of the plot twists are predictable if you are paying attention. For example, when Pattinson didn't shoot the masked attacker during the airport sequence, it didn't take much to connect the dots.  \n\nThat being said, the concept itself is interesting, it's the execution that is lacking. There are some cool set pieces though. The reverse fight scene of John David Washington from the two POVs was great. The score is also pretty on-point.\n\nOverall, I'd say it is a 7/10 movie at best.", "I... Felt kind of let down by this movie if I'm honest.\n\nIt felt like a Nolan movie paint-by-numbers , or something to that effect. There are quite a few weird cuts. I don't think the movie got far enough into the lore after introducing the villain and the inverted tech, it just sort of plateaued.

All the action scenes were exciting and exhilarating, with the Nolan magic added adding to my experience. The story itself is par for the course for action blockbusters, though a bit hard to follow at some points (I didn't understand specific point even after second viewing until reading about it on wikipedia). Performances by the cast was outstanding. John Davids Washington's athleticism was on full display while Robert Pattinson provided great banter and chemistry.

Apologies in advance, I'm not the most elaborate or well-spoken of people. \n\nI thought it was a pleasant surprise when we discover who the \"other woman\" jumping off the yacht is, considering the sentiments Kat expressed earlier in the film. To paraphrase, she said something to the effect of being envious of how free and liberated that woman was. How, in that moment, she wished it was her. To see that it was Kat's future self, but with the experiences she had endured throughout the movie and the development of her character, was a wonderful addition to her story.

And it's in everything, from the way they withold information to the way the audio is mixed so you have to strain to hear every line of dialogue (in IMAX at least).

The exposition scene in the trainyard and on the boat early on were incomprehensible\n\nThe set up with the Russian and the wife felt very Bond, but weirdly soulless.

No meaningful character arcs, no emotional stakes, none of the clarity or focus of his previous work & actively worse dialogue.\n\nCompare the opening to this to, say, the bank heist from Dark Knight. Both are tense & gripping but with the Dark Knight you understand everything that is going on from the get-go. You know what the two opposing sides are and you know their goals. With Tenet, Nolan gives you nothing. It all looks cool but I had no idea who was who or what they're trying to do.\n\nThis is a problem that spans the whole film. I struggled to properly understand the overall mission which was exacerbated by the fact that it was actually quite a dull mission. Typical end of the world extreme peril nonsense that is hard to care about because it's so over the top. It was Michael Bay territory. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more I think the climax is pretty terrible. The final set piece is a cluttered, convoluted mess. Nolan tries to pull the trick of weaving in two narratives into one to create something heightened and dramatic but it just doesn't work. The yacht scenes felt so lacking, I didn't believe the relationship between the characters and I didn't care. The action stuff in the desert was even worse. Genuinely had no idea how to follow what was going on. By the end of it, I was more relieved it was over than happy that they succeeded.\n\nCoherence went out of the window in the 3rd act in this film. The best scenes were the ones where Nolan explored the main concept of inversion in a way that was clear to the audience. The inverted fight in the art depot was fantastic, especially with the way you saw both sides of it. It was actually pretty terrifying seeing how unpredictable your assailant is when they're going backwards in time. The first time the main character steps into the inverted world was surreal and gorgeous. But by the end of film, Nolan just goes too far with his ambition because the end mission is a blob of inverted mush.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty disappointed. I'm probably going to rewatch it and maybe it will improve slightly but there is nothing really to come back to other than to make more sense of the plot. I think Nolan needs to have a completely different mindset with his next film because he is verging on self-parody now.", "Were I the only one that thought that the scene in the beginning at the opera could have been a Batman movie intro and Bane would enter the room? \n\nMy main complain about this move is that I didn't understand Kats purpose. She just felt like a damsel in distress. I heard before I went to see Tenet that one of the criticism that Nolan gets is that he can't write interesting female characters.

Then an inverted shooter points a gun at you and it sucks the bullet out of you, and heals the wound instantly.", "I just came home from it, and while watching it, I'm thinking this is a high concept movie that I need to watch again.  But after watching the movie, I have no desire to ever see this movie ever again, even if I missed out on some of the meaning behind it.", "Wait, I haven't followed any marketing for this outside of the first trailer. Is the main character's name seriously \"the protagonist\" or is that a joke?", "Does Nolan know what punctuation is?

Ow!", "Now everything I want is Robert Pattinson and Adam Driver together in a movie. I don't care how.", "I recently watched Batman Begins and was shocked at how pacey the beginning was. However, Tenet's first 30-40 minutes has been utterly butchered in the cutting room. We are left no time to breathe, and whilst this is intended throughout Tenet - the movie takes joy in ensuring our knowledge is limited - its initial acts are poorly cut.\n\nMore jarring still is the bizarre use of exposition. JDW experiences not 1, not 2, but 3 sage-like archetypes included to deliver information and drive the narrative within the first 30 minutes. A random man on a trawler, Dimple Kapadia providing wisdom and Michael Caine in a frankly bizarre scene in which a replica drawing is used as a plot device to connect the Protagonist to the Antagonist's wife. \n\nI cannot recall a single non-exposition-based scene in the first 30-40 minutes. We travel through the story with no sense, no emotion and effectively no ears due to the horrendous sound mixing. The film takes itself too seriously in thinking it's smart, to the extent where you stop wanting it to be. \n\nTenet has a brilliant concept, it's intriguing, thought-provoking and full of intent. However you can't help wondering if there's a better film in Tenet whilst watching it. Its narrative breaks the 4th wall in wilfully challenging you to understand it. It's a demonstration that emotion and clarity are bedrocks of cinema, and neglecting either too much creates major problems.\n\nI can't help but feel a rewatch will simply ask more questions of the mechanics and narrative. Ultimately I grow tired of plots intent on ending the world, and it feels particularly shoe horned here.\n\nInception and Interstellar stretched the limits of how far we are willing to open our minds to concepts. But this is because they were fine tuned and allowed time to breathe.\n\nThe execs had a clear impact on this film. Its runtime is exactly 150 minutes. I guarantee that there are 20 minutes of genuinely integral footage cut out to ensure that it falls in blockbuster territory. This, in my opinion, killed this film.", "I say this as the biggest Nolan fanboy, but that was absolutely terrible. Utter convoluted nonsense. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the dialogue and acting in the final scene was so awful and out of place. What a let down. \n\nHopefully when I sleep on it I'll change my mind!", "I caught the re-release of Inception a few weeks ago, after not having seen it since it came out, and came away impressed with how Nolan was able to communicate so many crazy ideas and plot threads in a clean and accessible way. One of his biggest flaws is clunky expositional dialogue, and Inception is certainly guilty of that at times, but I got it! I knew enough about the conceit of the movie to get what was happening, I knew what the stakes were for the characters, I cared about them achieving their goals, and the ending was satisfying and pulled it together. All the typical Nolan expositional dialogue served its purpose perfectly well, and the movie holds up great.\n\nSo here we are a decade later and he's made one of the most frustratingly convoluted movies I've ever seen. It's partially a dialogue problem (these characters talk in circles and rarely like real human beings), partially a conceptual problem (there's so fucking many wrinkles in the time-inversion conceit that it just never stops building on itself, never giving you a chance to catch up) and partially an audio problem (totally agree with everyone else; for the first time I regret watching this in IMAX because the sound was punishing and I couldn't even pick out the extremely pivotal dialogue). So you have a movie with an absurdly complicated plot that relies on you absorbing an absolute *fuckton* of dialogue, a conceit that's hard to wrap your mind around visually and narratively and a soundtrack that doesn't make those things easy. This is a bad combination.\n\nAnd it's extra frustrating because I can't call it *bad*, can I? The set pieces are mostly exciting, the score (mixing aside) is great, all the performances hit their mark and there is a thrill in watching all this craziness come together. And there's something I admire in Nolan's steadfast desire to not let blockbuster audiences off easy.\n\nBut there's a difference between not holding your audience's hand and just shouting nonsense at them until they don't know what's what. By the time I got to the final battle/whatever scene I knew the goal (stop the explosion, save the world) but didn't have the slightest fucking clue what anyone was doing or where they were going. The cumulative effect was just sensory overload that completely overwhelmed any connection I could have to the emotional core of the story, or even just a basic level of \"what happens next?\" suspense.\n\nThis is a movie that simply just overcomplicates itself until it becomes a blur of noise and gunshots and explosions and at the end of the day it just boils down to \"good guy stops bad guy from destroying the world\", doesn't it? Or in other words: a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Not much different from any other blockbuster movie (whether it be 007, Marvel, Michael Bay, etc.) except with a veneer of clever twist-y-ness on top of it.\n\nI'm super happy that I was able to see a new movie in a theatre again, and I'm very happy I did, but I don't think I liked it very much.", "This movie was a whole lot of nothing. There were some pretty awesome action sequences, but that's it. The sound design in the film was awful, dialogue was cramped with overexposition  the acting was mediocre at best.

The stakes just didn't feel high at all. \n\nThere were some cool moments visually, but a lot were just concepts that desperately tried to make themselves work in a narrative sense.\n\nI mean who were they even fighting in the desert at the end? 90% of shots were just red and blue team.

I love it.", "Huge disappointment for me, here's why:\n\nDialogue/Characters in general - Nolan missed the mark big time for me with the dialogue for this one. The villain was VERY weak imo and not once felt intimidating at all. Also his motivations were just awful... \n\nAudio mix - Jeeeeez I am glad people are giving the film shit for this, some scenes weren't ***that*** bad but some, in particular the sailing scene, were an absolute joke. I seriously find it difficult to enjoy any film where I am struggling to hear a good chunk of dialogue. \n\nScore - The score was pretty good as is standard for Nolan, however I felt it was much too overbearing and felt out of place in quite a few scenes. \n\nPACING - My god the pacing in the first hour or so was very choppy and all over the place and then smoothed out towards the middle thankfully.\n\nAction sequences - So the kitchen fight scene was great fun however that was the only action sequence I felt was enjoyable in the entire film. The corridor fight scene was just pure Hollywood fighting with cuts every 2 seconds. The final assault I felt had a lot of potential but ultimately fell flat for me, the building being shot twice was cool though. \n\nOne nitpick - When JDW was inverted and the car exploded, this really sucked me out of the movie, so many questions. If the energy of that explosion was truly inverted and froze the car instead how tf does the protagonist survive that? We see the window freeze and the next shot is him on a table looking fine??? Come on. \n\nWhat I did like:\n\nPerformances - The acting was pretty top notch throughout even with the flakey dialogue. The villain I wasn't convinced by however. \n\nVisuals - Some sequences were stunning and some shots in the inverse were really cool. \n\nHighway Scene - Even though the explosion made no sense to me the overall sequence was great to watch, that goes for both versions.", "I understood and took away exactly one thing from this movie; a cheese grater to the cheek will instantly immobilize a man.", "I want to complain about the sound mixing, but honestly I was probably the one who mixed it, but in the future", "Christopher Nolan decided \"Why make a movie that 100% of the people will watch one time when you can make a move where 10% of the people watch it ten times?\"", "What?", "I really enjoyed the movie and will definitely be rewatching many times.

The first half of the movie was a bit hard to follow, but that was mostly made up for the second half of the movie, where all the confusion clears up when they go through everything again. \n\nDefinitely not Nolan's best work. It's basically just Inception (which is a great movie) with a different gimmick, less character and more confusion. I feel like they should've focused less on the romance between the Protag and Kat and more on the Protag and Neil.

It didn't for a moment feel like something I was watching because it was fun or interesting or entertaining. Nolan seems to have gotten so lost in the sheer complexity and wunderbarness of his idea that he's let the film become a chore.\n\nAnd what a terrible sound mix that was.", "I personally feel like this is a perfect movie to debate on whether a movie needs to invoke an emotional response to be good. I liked the movie- it made me think, it was something original, which is not that common and they crashed an actual 747 into a building. What's not to like?  But at the same time, the characters were extremely bland. It's not that Nolan doesn't know how to do emotion- that scene in Interstellar when he goes through his children's old messages still gets me. I felt no connection to any of the characters, but I don't think there was intended to be any connection. I think this movie was a brilliant idea put into action, giving that idea the center stage, and in the process, ignoring any character development, and I respect that choice.", "ngl, this would have been epic as a mini series. Could have taken some time to make the characters meaningful and establish motives. As a movie, it was nice to look at and experience.

Kind of felt like the protagonist died at first and was living in a dream throughout the movie; just jumping scenes everywhere.", "It was fine. The performances were all pretty solid (JDW was very charismatic, Pattinson gave a great performance and Kenneth Branagh was excellent), the soundtrack was excellent and being a Nolan movie it of course looked beautiful. It was also nice to see a Bollywood actress have a substantial role in the movie! The action sequences were great, with that classic Nolan spectacle and carried enough suspense and tension.\n\nBut oh man, Nolan definitely over-extended himself in a lot of ways. It wasn't like Inception and to a lesser extent Interstellar, where a challenging/esoteric concept was presented in a digestible manner. It honestly feels like Nolan was incapable of presenting this idea of entropy and time in a interesting way, and just resorted to poorly written exposition that didn't really do much to mitigate my confusion. Also, is it just me or is the dialogue weirdly bad for a Nolan movie? He's never been great at writing well formed characters or writing actual drama, but it really stood out here.\n\nAlso as everyone says the audio mixing was all over the place. Definitely see this movie with subtitles if it's an option at your cinema.\n\nOverall I'm feeling a 6/10.

I\u2019ll have to watch again to fully appreciate that part", "SPOILER ALERT  \n\n\nI thought it was a really good movie but also incredibly confusing. What we witnessed is essentially like TimeCop and those types of cheesy movies from the 1980s where the protagonist travels through time to stop a mad terrorist, but translated into a more serious tone. Similar to how Nolan translated Batman from Cheese to an action-thriller.\n\nThe movie is basically the origin story of the Chief of Time Police. The whole squads at the end of the movie that assist him are members of Tenet - An organization that a future Him will start. They're a special task force that deals with - and uses - time anomalies in order to carry out objectives. Its implied that they've been around for a long time and their LEADER (Implied to be the protagonist from the Future) has sent them on multiple missions to deal with this kind of operations. Tenet is a slice of their operations and there is a much bigger plot happening in the background concerning secret organizations, cults and in the case of Sator's character, a hidden Devil character that sent the bomb back in the first place. \n\nKat's son is implied to be Neil with a motif shot of him carrying a backpack and walking away - The same shot that informs us that Neil is the man who died in the underground bunker and as the man who saves The Protagonist in the beginning. \n\nA lot of the confusion with Tenet is because its part of a larger canon. Its like whoever wrote it already had a vision of a larger science fiction spy thriller time travel series and decided to use one specific chain of events to tell a movie. The plot is incredibly rich and there are multiple allusions to several organizations in the future with different intentions and Tenet is just one of those organizations.

I thought the first 10 minutes were set up well and had the promise of a quality sequel to Busan. The opening scene was neat, the boat passing under the bridge going into the harbor was a cool shot. It was all okay up to the run-in with the soldiers. From there is was incredibly unconvincing comic car soap bar action with no stakes or grounding in reality, there were multiple villains who weren't given much to do. They should have combined them and I thought the movie made a point of establishing setup with them that ultimately went nowhere. I didn't get much in the way of emotional stakes. You know what's coming for all the characters and there isn't a big reason to care. The initial gladiator scene in the mall was really well done. Thought that was the coolest scene in the movie by far, it just wasn't enough to hold it up. The movie ends with another huge chase sequence that I was prepared to take a nap during. It was just so unfun. I wish this movie was more fun given the direction and style they took it. \n\nIt just kinda felt to me that they started with a more grounded sequel and took a break after page one to do some peyote. The rest is the product of that. It felt like a Frankenstein creation of a couple different movie sequel ideas. The characters in the original we're all archetypal blueprints, but they at least had some personality. The wealthy out of touch dad, the two older sisters, the working badass dad with his pregnant wife, the rich assholes, the high school kids. They all had something to do and be remembered by, even with their broad character tropes. They all had scenes that established them and made them real. \n\nI just watched Peninsula last night and I'm struggling to remember any of the characters. The over the top dumb bad guy. The bad guy who might be a less bad guy but is still a bad guy? The brother in-laws who have one personality trait in common (shared loss) and nothing else to write about for the entire movie. The two girls who can drive car(s). The widow? We never have a reason to invest in their plight, especially when they are given the invincible badass treatment the whole movie. There was just no development at all save for the very last scene which just didn't land with the lack of prior build-up to it. The characters were a fake, rubber creation meant to get from point A to point B, just like the cars in the movie. It was a bad movie that I enjoyed marginally more than its quality, but not by much.", "I feel like I\u2019m one of the few people who loved both Train to Busan and Peninsula. \n\nThey are quite different, and each one is good for its own reasons.

Either one could have worked well as a film, but they didn't quite have the chops to pull off both at once.\n\nA lot of the fat in this movie could have been trimmed, too much time spent developing characters that didn't need to exist like the brother who gets captured and the rambling grandpa. Have the daughters save the main guy but have the mom get captured during the first attempt to sneak into the compound and get the money, she takes the place of the brother as the participant in the games. Should have combined the captain and the sergeant into one character as the main antagonist; he finds out about the money too late but steals the truck in the end. The daughters and the main guy use the zombies to storm the compound and save the mom, leading to the car chase.\n\nThe first half hour or so of the movie I actually quite enjoyed, I really like the mythology of the franchise and the idea that some people managed to survive in abandoned zombie-infested land and learned how to deal with them (the firecrackers and kitted out cars). I even didn't mind the CGI even though the lack of blood with the amount of zombies getting splattered was egregious. But neither villain really worked, and unlike the first film which had tropey but well-defined characters so every death mattered, the audience here is given no reason to really care about anyone other than the mom, especially the brother that ends up accomplishing nothing.\n\nOverall a decent movie but not nearly as good as Train to Busan.", "I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t prolong the macguffin chase. The opening of them silently moving through trying to get to the money was great. They had 3 days to get out they were back in 1 day. The bad guys weren\u2019t even that bad imo. They were just trying to survive in a world that abandoned them so even though movie depicted them as evil I had a hard time sympathizing. The only evil part they did was torture. \n\nI want to see a proper sequel and this could\u2019ve been it. They shouldn\u2019t have split the story 3 ways like that. There was so much I liked about this movie yet so much I thought was really poorly executed.\n\nI\u2019m kinda rambling if you\u2019re still reading.

LOL). then it's about 15-20 minutes of the captured humans vs. zombies cage match (shown in the trailers). then the remainder of the film is back to FAST & FURIOUS/TOKYO DRIFT car chases/horrible CGI zombies being run over. even the zombies themselves seem like an afterthought. in TRAIN there were several great zombie sequences. there's only 1 standout zombie scene and that was spoiled in the trailers.\n\ni actually WAS excited to see PENINSULA since i loved TRAIN TO BUSAN but it's the polar opposite of everything great about TRAIN TO BUSAN imo.", "Cars got more screen time than most of the characters:D", "What a terrible piece of shit.

When asked about how it works a simple \"I don't know\" answer would have been sufficient. Instead the movie falls into the trap of attempting to give us an explanation, which only leads to further plot holes being developed. \n\nAdditionally the idea of testing it on the general public doesn't make sense, if only because everyone gets a different power. This would have had worked better if there was different compounds and they were trying to figure out which ones did what, but that wasn't the case here. Again, it's a poor decision on the part of the writers to try and explain when it wasn't needed. \n\nLast point - some of the scenes just felt cringe. Like the class room day dream part.

I would've been fine with JGL and Fishback's characters pulling some Batman and Robin detective work to bring down the Power network for the whole movie, so the cliche last-minute mad scientist angle was a major bummer.\n\nI'll say the body horror stuff and the \"powers with consequences\" notion was super fun and I hope we get more of that in some kind of sequel.

The action was great and they filmed almost all of the movie in New Orleans and it really gave a lot of the scenes some character.\n\nBut it was just okay.

And this is coming from someone who has repeatedly watched STREET KINGS...\n\nI genuinely do not understand how Ayer could\u2019ve  fucked up this bad. Script is passable, if uninspiring. Acting is solid. But there is ZERO style, momentum, or tension due to the way it\u2019s filmed and edited. HARSH TIMES and END OF WATCH are comparable driving around LA films with barely any plot. Yet both of those moves are well executed and we care about (or at least are compelled by) the people driving around.\n\nShia is good. Whatever.

I know how important acting is to him but it just makes him look more ridiculous than anything.", "After the first act, I was actually wondering why everyone disliked this movie so much. It started out pretty good. By the end, though... *good lord* this movie is bad. I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just make a list.\n\n1) This is the sorta obvious one, but the story is very generic (and made no sense). I'm usually not all that harsh on this topic, because I don't think every detail in a movie has to be 100% logical for a movie to be good. But this one made such a lack of sense that you couldn't even take it seriously.\n\nThe big one for me was how this group apparently took taxes from all the biggest and baddest gangs in LA, but apparently was like... 10 people? You had Wizard (in jail), the main character, creeper, the uncle, and a few other people we see randomly. As soon as shit hit the fan, there was like *no one there* to help. How the hell were they able to keep the entire LA criminal world scared and at bay when a handful of people from Mexico came and destroyed them instantly?\n\n\n2) The dialogue was atrocious. *So many* cliche \"movie lines,\" like the main character grabbing his dead wife, who was laying in about 4-people's-worth of blood, saying \"wake up! wake up!\" \n\n\n3) There were scenes that were so silly that I actually laughed out loud. Like at the end, when they went to get the main baddy, and he was sitting on the bed in a robe, staring at a stock chart on a laptop and typing furiously. Like, wtf, lmao. I guess he was typing \"BUY SELL BUY SELL\"\n\n Or in the final \"fight scene\" when the main character flashes back to that random-ass judo class scene that literally only existed so he could flash back. Then he didn't even use any judo, he just picked up a sink and smashed the dudes head in. Stuff like this was so silly and ridiculous that it took away from any grittiness.\n\n\n4) The main actor was pretty bad. He was alright in the more casual scenes, but it completely fell apart anytime he had any sort of emotional one-on-one scene. That phone call with his dad at the end, or the scene where he was bathing his dead wife... felt a bit like a student film, or a weird TV movie or something. I dont place this issue fully on the actor, though, because I think a lot of the \"bad acting\" in this movie is actually bad directing/editing that makes the acting seem bad.\n\n\n5) Creeper was obviously the most compelling part of the movie, but he honestly didn't do anything. Shia Lebeouf did a good job with it, and it's an interesting character overall. But, there were no scenes where he really said or did anything important. There were a few random flashback-type scenes of him doing some gruesome shit, but it's insane to me that we never really got a scene with him actually being the violent person he is supposed to be. The \nmovie kept just telling us he was a stone-cold murderer, but it never showed us.\n\nIt's crazy to me that Ayer didn't use this character more. The main actor had all these emotional scenes and speeches, and he didn't do a great job. Meanwhile you have Leabouf over here turning in a solid performance, and he basically just stood around, put a few guns in a few mouths, then died quickly in a scene we saw through a cell phone. Like, come on. So much missed potential.\n\n\n6) Direction was pretty bad. There were some scenes of legitimate Ayer-grade gritty realism, which were great. But there were way more scenes with bad cuts, bad slo-mos, forced emotion, horrible music that didnt fit, etc etc.\n\n\n7) The over-use of plot devices is basically absurd.\n\nOh, we need to show that he's a family man. Here's a Quincea\u00f1era! \n\nOh, we need to show that this guy is from the real *mexican* mexican gang, so here's a scene where he sacrifices a chicken and a human female!\n\nOh, we need a reason for him to leave his wife and kids at the hotel, so here's a million dollars in a barrel from a heist 9 years ago that is at his cousin's house for some reason! \n\nLike, damn near every scene was an illogical plot device to force the story wherever Ayer wanted it to go (which was nowhere, by the way).\n\nI mostly feel bad for Shia Leabouf here. You can tell that he actually cared, and he developed this pretty compelling character. But it's just thrown into this nonsense script filled with hollywood cliches and a sea of generic characters.", "Can I just get a prequel of David and Creeper riding around talking shit and collecting taxes?  That was the best parts of the movie.  I want to see that armored car robbery.  All the shit with Conejo? Meh.  I didn't hate it but it wasn't nearly as good as I'd hoped (although, holy shit that head grind out the van was brutal).  \n  \nShia was great but unfortunately totally underused.  Overall I'd give this a 5.5, maybe a 6.  It's not terrible but it misses the mark.  The most frustrating part is that it had all the pieces to be good, they're just poorly utilized or missed opportunities (and that bjj stuff was soo poorly shoehorned in, it was like Ayer saw Elite Squad II and thought, 'I want to do that' but couldn't really make it work).", "I can\u2019t believe Shia tattooed his entire torso for that.", "Did anyone else think that the Bloods risk their lives pretty easy for a guy they barely knew?", "chest tattoo for 10 seconds!?!?", "What was the function of having Creeper in this movie aside from being the \"demon\" on Daniel's shoulder and an exposition dump excuse?\n\nWhy does Daniel train Jiu Jitsu but Creeper has the cauliflower ear? Is Creeper even real, or a manifestation of Daniel's dark side who just also has separate and distinct relationships with everyone else?\n\nWhy does Daniel flash back to his jiu jitsu training when he's getting choked on the floor and then not do a jiu jitsu technique to escape? Does his jiu jitsu school teach bashing people over the head with broken toilet pieces? Couldn't you have left jiu jitsu out of this movie completely? Was it just to remind us that Daniel is a thundering dumbass?\n\nWho is Daniel collecting taxes for if he and his crew seem to be the only people involved in the gang? What threat does the old stanky ass Wizard pose from his jail cell if he also doesn't have any associates on the outside who could presumably help Daniel secure his territory when Conejo invades, and threaten subordinates like Daniel if they don't make their count, which Daniel seems to be terrified of at the start of the movie? Daniel's uncle had to \"put it to a vote\" re: killing Conejo earlier, which implies there's some structure of members higher up than Daniel who would want retribution against Conejo and could help Daniel get it, but instead he goes to the Bloods for help??\n\nWhy are the bloods willing to get involved at all? Why is the Blood leader so incredibly enamored with Daniel, to the extent that he'd accompany him on a  suicide mission against another gang? It seems really implausible that their professional relationship is so good that he'd risk gang warfare with the cartel and his own life for a guy he just kinda knows from work. He didn't even get a laced invite to the quinceanera.\n\nCreeper and Daniel just had 1.5 million dollars buried in a barrel behind his house that, in spite of being drug dealers, they got through an entirely unrelated caper 6 years ago? That seems incredibly convenient. Perhaps he could've used that to hire the Bloods to help him kill Conejo, but instead he banks on their desire to help out of the kindness of their cold gangster hearts. If he paid them, there could've been a point to the stupid \"luckily I have 1.5 million bucks in a barrel\" farce, but nope, it's pointless.\n\nHow do Daniel and the Bloods know where Conejo's hitmen are? They didn't even know that Daniel's crew was dead at the beginning of the scene, but an hour later they just already know where these guys are, even though Diego made such a big deal about how it would take weeks to track him down and how evasive he was just that morning?\n\nIf Conejo wanted to kill Daniel for not kissing his ring, wouldn't it have made much more sense to do it right there at the table surrounded by a dozen guys with machine guns than to wait for Daniel at the repair shop to ambush them? Is he unable to kill without doing a blood sacrifice so he had to get that taken care of first?\n\nHow did this movie get greenlit at all?", "Anyone else laugh at the line \u201ceveryone you love is gonna die bad\u201d?", "As someone who has been starving for new films but can't justify paying $20 for a rental just for myself, I'm really excited this is only $7 to rent.

Visually /stylistically strong with a solid soundtrack and performances by its leads, but completely let down by its nonsensical incoherent garbage story that felt like a blender full of rote LA crime movie tropes. Shia LaBeouf plays his well dressed ice cold killer character Creeper with magnetism and presence. Too bad Creeper doesn't do jack shit in this film besides look cool and act menacing, talk about his Keto diet, brag about banging chicks, get clowned on by David's sister, and then die immediately once shit pops off like a random henchmen in an Austin Powers movie. Seriously, the most criminal thing about this movie is its waste of Shia's character. He got a full chest tattoo for this pile of shit lol. Bobby Soto plays his character David with charisma, but David's bad ass mystic is also eroded quickly once him and Creeper aren't cruising around LA looking cool anymore. I should've known this was going to be shit when they thought George Lopez could convincingly play an OG boss lol.

Or maybe just something uncomplete? \n\nI mean, I didn't think it was horrible. Script and acting aside, it **looked** like something you'd see on page 4 of Amazon Prime. The titles, the color, the editing... It didn't look like 30 million dollars. It almost looked like they released an unfinished version. I've actually really liked all of Ayer's movies so far (not counting Suicide Squad). Say what you will about them but at least you have to admit they all LOOKED really good.\n\nThe script for this movie actually had some cool shit in it. I felt the characters, especially Creeper,  were almost really great, but not explored or handled right. I can respect them killing Shia when they did, I was a shock to see him go, but how much cooler would it have been for him to be there at the end fight? I would have understood more if they built the leads dependence on him more then made him go in ALONE, but instead, he just goes and gets that dude from the beginning to join him. And the twist at the end where Santa Clause, or Ghost, or whatever the fuck Keyser S\u00f6ze's name was turned out to be the leads dad I thought was a cool idea; it just didn't have the emotional effect I think Ayer wanted. (Screenwriters, how do you think they could have set-up/paid-off that better?) \n\nSo overall I didn't hate it. I'll probably watch it again if not just to figure out what happened to it.

That was this movie. The entire reel. From start to finish. A massive tower of shit. \n\nNot even cult status of \"so bad it was good\" could save this disaster. I feel cheated.

Most of the acting and plot were very stale; nothing new, no attempts at reinventing this kind of story we\u2019ve been told countless times.   \nMy biggest gripe was this - I think a lot of us were there for Shia and while he had more screen time than what some of these comments led me to believe, him not being in the final 30 min was a big let down.  What was even more confusing as to why they killed him off 2/3s in, is that he was the only character that seemed to have been given an interesting back story.  The main cast had backstories, but they were all very generic and service level.  Creeper had little idioms given to him constantly that made you wonder who he was.  His diet, philosophy, his partner warning others not to get him drunk at the party, his love life.  Tons of interesting hints at who this guy is and what he could become when he needs to get violent.  No one else was given that kind of treatment, so once creeper was dead I really didn\u2019t care about anyone else that was left and it seemed they built up this badass character to essentially do nothing in the end.", "Biggest takeaway: Shia LaBeouf is AMAZING \n\nSecond biggest takeaway: Ayer needs to spend A LOT more time on his scripts", "Yo I just saw this and I feel so bad for Shia. He went and fucking got a permanent tattoo on his chest with the words CREEPER on it for this? He also had prosthetics give him fake cauliflower ear for what? Like I wouldn't mess with a dude in real life that had it as bad as Shia's but we never even saw him do anything aside from talk about his Keto diet.\n\nMy favourite part was definitely the ending where Conejo is doing some stock trading and just furiously typing commands into his keyboard at 100 words per minute. When David has that random as flashback to his Jiu Jitsu training I thought it would show him controlling his breathing and doing some smart technique that takes Conejo by surprise but instead he literally gets up and bashes Conejo's head in with a sink. They never taught us that at my gym haha.\n\nMan from the forgettable dialogue, cliche gangster tropes, to the whole arc with the black bloods at the very end of the movie- this was such a disappointment.

With slight variations, each character had an identical response to the situation, and after awhile it became boring to watch them each repeat the same lines and gestures.\n\nGenerally, more restraint and clarity would have gone a long way.\n\nWhile watching this film I was thinking of a much more effective movie from the 80s by Austrian director Michael Haneke called The Seventh Continent. If you want a truly bleak and fatalistic film, watch that. Even though it's a great film, I've only been able to watch it twice, because it leaves me feeling physically ill for days after. It\u2019s about a seemingly normal middle class family who decide to kill themselves (young daughter included), and before doing so they destroy all of their material possessions. Unlike She Dies Tomorrow, The Seventh Continent is extremely restrained in its depiction of impending death. Most of what we see leading up to the suicides are the characters robotically going about daily tasks - in the same methodical manner with which they later end their lives. We also never learn why they decide to kill themselves. Yet that movie is infinitely more unsettling and emotionally moving than this one was, largely because it\u2019s so restrained that when the characters finally show bursts of despair it cuts to your core.\n\nThat's also an example of a film that leaves questions unanswered but is still clear. Even though you don't learn exactly why the characters kill themselves, you get it on an emotional level after seeing them go through the bleak monotony of their lives. The problem with She Dies Tomorrow is you don't even understand the character's psychological state on an emotional level.", "I thought the middle half was decently engaging but once I realized that it wasn't going anywhere, I really started to lose interest. This is the definition of style over substance and meandering for the sake of meandering. \n\nHow many shots did we need of Amy lying around touching the floor or wandering in the first 15 minutes, exactly? I'm okay with the fact that we don't know where the virus came from, in fact I'm really glad they didn't explain that. The idea of it being ethereal and unknown is much more effective imo. The problem is, there's no fucking point to anything that happens. Reading the one sentence premise is literally a description of the plot. There's no conclusion, the characters don't grow or change, and I was just left wondering what the point of it was. \n\nThis is the epitome of a one-idea movie, with maybe enough content for a short stretched into an aggressively padded 84 minutes that felt like 2 hours. What feels like a jumping off point to tell a good story (aka the idea of this idea being contagious) is instead just the end of where it goes and what it does. There's no surprises, no payoff, just meandering.", "I watched this because Olivia Taylor Dudley and Michelle Rodriguez are in it. \n\nNever been more disappointed in my life. Now I want a new movie with both of them in it.", "I feel like this movie is about what it's like to be alive and increasingly feeling like we're approaching the end of the world. In the movie the anxiety hits everyone on a personal level \u2013 that they specifically are going to die tomorrow \u2013 but it spreads so rapidly that by the end random strangers seem to have it and you get the sense that very shortly, whole communities and maybe the whole world are going to feel like they're staring down the end, and I think that's more of the big idea here: what happens when nearly everyone can agree that shit is going to be bad. I feel like it's maybe inspired by the imminent threat of climate change and the idea that the world may be unrecognizable or uninhabitable in a shorter range of time than any of us could be comfortable with. And the characters represent a range of responses to that threat: some panic (Jane), some fall hedonistically into bad habits (Amy), some redirect their fear to the next generation (Jason & Susan), and some become just kind of nihilistically chill (Sky & Erin). That's my read on it anyway.\n\nOverall, I mostly liked it. It's funnier than I thought it would be. It definitely feels slight and padded out to the 85 minutes when it probably could have been about half the length but I was pretty taken in by the hypnotic pacing at times.\n\nI see people complaining about the lack of character attachment/development and that didn't really bother me, as this feels a lot more like a thematic piece than a character study of any kind. It never really occurred to me to care about the internal lives of these characters or their development, they all felt more like visualizations of the core idea than actual three-dimensional humans.", "It felt like the director wanted to go the pretentious route, but lacked the confidence to be pretentious.  \n\nA little too on the nose, some mediocre acting and a whole lot of nothing.", "I know they're different movies but I honestly found myself thinking more existentially after watching Palm Springs than this.

It is a slow, artsy-type film, but god damn was I bored and frustrated by the movie. I just wanted something to happen and after the 27th shot of someone just simply repeating \"I'm going to die tomorrow\" I just started to feel like the writer/director didn't actually have many interesting ideas to show on screen.\n\nI'm all for slow, artistic movies that try to establish a mood, and the concept is cool, but I feel like this movie was kinda hollow.

It's definitely worth watching though. And Amy Seimetz shows a lot of promise visually, there's some gorgeous moments here. Knowing what she has been through with Shane Carruth it's obvious this film must have mirrored the pain and confusion she was dealing with in real life, but I'm glad the film is doing well critically and it's certainly a unique experience. \n\nJane Adams is the main reason to watch it, though.

But there lies the problem, i don't think it does it well.\nI didn't feel the terror i felt before by just giving into my thoughts, i didn't truly feel anxious watching this, i actually felt a little bored after a while. There is no real meat to anything going on in this film, it's people repeating the same idea over and over again, sometimes some surreal elements added on top (mostly just different colored lightsources shining them onto the face) and not much else, no deeper discovery, no standout performance, nothing i can hold onto.\nIt truly felt like a 15 minute shortfilm expanded to 1.5 hours, and that's not what you want quite frankly.", "The worst movie I\u2019ve seen so far this year.

That said, I will easily take this over recent movies like The Relic, The Room, Vivarium, or even The Killing of a Sacred Deer. (It has several elements in common with all of these movies.)\n\nThis movie has a lot of flaws - the pseudo star-studded cast and unnecessary cameos, some particularly pretentious lines, what seemed to be a little too much latitude to the cast to improvise, shots that were just a bit too long - but it is extremely effective in creating a mood of tension, dread and uncertainty that transcends whatever mundane or boring aspects are baked into it. \n\nThis movie captures difficult emotions well and is extremely visceral and impactful. It\u2019s hard not to walk away from this feeling something. I know it was made before the quarantine, but this movie somehow captures a lot of the angst people are going through right now because of it.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d give it an 8.5/10.

Shockingly, watching people passively mope and resign themselves immediately doesn't make for riveting viewing. \n\nThe pacing is fucking horrible. It repeats the same operatic record piece four fucking times in a row while Amy does fuck-all but drink, cry and waste the viewers time. It was genuinely miserable to watch, and felt like I was watching some deranged anti-joke dragged out and beaten to death.\n\nThere's no tension. The only threat is what these people might do to themselves, and no one is worth rooting for because these people fucking suck.

There's nothing in the way of violence or scares, with a few bloody images that have basically no impact because of everything above.\n\nIt has one thinly sketched idea it has no real idea how to utilize, and uselessly spins it's wheels from the first 5 minutes onwards. No explanation is even hinted at, and the movie is padded with characters discussing worthless nonsense that has nothing to do with anything on the screen, and aren't even interesting in their own right. The whole movie plays out like a parody of student films, but even those can be interesting or have characters who aren't shallow, self-absorbed cunts.\n\nAlso, there's nothing interesting about flashing red, blue and green lights on people's faces.

Also funnier than I expected.", "[deleted]", "Good fucking movie. Loved the cast, loved how it veered between genres, loved the dark humor.", "I actually really enjoyed this film moreso because I just took the certainty of death as more metaphorical than the actual pretense of the film. I see it more as people deal with those moments of life that are filled with tremendous anxiety or dread, and each character sort of has an actual underlying issue beyond death that is absolutely certain: Amy's generalized anxiety and confrontation with substance use, Jane/Susan/Jason's incredibly destructive and toxic interactions with one another, and Brian/Tilly trying to hold onto a long-term relationship that has long since fizzled out. Taking the film from that vantage point and using the grand concept and unknown of death to portray the uncertainty of what happens when we take a next step in life or move on from something, and the film really worked for me.", "This movie was horrible. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. It didn\u2019t go anywhere. Like, ever. LOL! I don\u2019t know what the hell people consider a horror movie these days. But this ain\u2019t it, chief.

I actually didn't mind the more serious tone and parts dealing with loss. Seth explained the overall idea on the recent WTF podcast. It's more of a film about dealing with the death of loved ones AND the idea that if your great grandfather could meet you today he'd probably find LOTS of issues with his great grandson. The WTF delved deep into the identity and cultural gap. I think it was a harder concept to pull off in the film and it didn't work so well at points. That being said enjoyed it.\n\nI'm also a bit bias because I'm Jewish (non-practicing) and the same age as Seth (and Canadian too) and I felt to some extent it's such a movie that non-Jews might have a bit of trouble identifying with.", "The movie is best when Seth Rogen and Seth Rogen are getting along.\n\nHonestly, the first 30 minutes were really incredible, I was ready to write a glowing review and disagree with the mixed comments on here, then it just sort of meanders for another hour.

He\u2019s Trump? He\u2019s an undocumented immigrant? We hate his ideas? He means well? Religion good? Religion bad? It felt like every 5 minutes they start a new plot line.\n\nHonestly the best stuff is the opening scene shot in 4:3. The cinematography really is great in that, and the journey to America is quite cute. The following scene made me appreciate our modern society, seeing how far his family had come. Then it really goes to shit.\n\nHad it just been the two of them building a pickle business together in Brooklyn, it could have been quite fun.

I think I expected a more conventional narrative where they become fast friends and then fight\u200c, but they were enemies for far longer. Then the Trump allegory came in hot and I was worried that would be the main point.

He's called \"Pickle Seth\", funniest shit I've ever seen.", "I didn't like his movie at all.

Then it became something of a versus movie and it was really dumb after a while. The whole deportation thing really took me out of the movie", "Huge leap in logic in that there was no media fanfare of a guy waking up after 100 years. He would be on every talk show known to man and be a worldwide phenomenon. Ben would\u2019ve toured with him and got his funding. I understand why they wouldn\u2019t want this as it affects the plot. So what they should\u2019ve done was have him wake up and somehow track down Ben without alerting authorities etc. maybe he goes back to his old apartment and finds a deed etc. who knows. But him not being famous took me out of it. Especially when he goes viral for selling pickles.

For a heart felt comedy it made me laugh a handful of times and had some scenes which left me genuinely happy. However with how the marketing was selling this movie I was hoping it would be more akin to Rogan's other bittersweet films like 50-50 or Funny People. With a plot straight out of a Twilight Zone/Black Mirror episode with a few plot conveniences sprinkled in. The short run time felt like things were missing and rather raced to the finish instead of soaking in the complexities that could arise from such a dynamic and the after credits scene which seemed more with the flare of a traditional Rogan comedy felt welcomed and needed.\n\nOver all a 6/10, a rather ok film. Not Rogan's best work but nowhere near the worst film he has made.", "For a movie about a time traveling immigrant preserved in pickle brine, it sure felt low budget. Most of it takes place in Seth\u2019s apartment. I was meh on the movie. None of the jokes landed for me and the sentimentality felt forced.", "I don't think the story beats had enough time to breathe and it felt rushed to the point of it possessing a cartoonish logic and sense of time. However, the film had a really strong sense of self, spot-on social commentary, and a great subversion of the coming to America format.", "Enjoyable movie for me. Doesn\u2019t take itself overly serious and there are some laughs here and there. Story could\u2019ve been fleshed out a little more as some of it felt a bit repetitive but overall, thought Rogen did a good job with his performance.", "I honestly thought they would go on with Ben trying to destroy Herschel's success only to inadvertently make him even more of a success for a little longer. Followed up by Ben's friend trying to invest and screw over Herschel with Ben deciding to help him out only for the reveal of all the sabotage to cause some more trouble between them before things are resolved. \n\nThe plot point of having a friend with investing capability is pretty much just there to have Ben fail and be jealous of Herschel when his friend gets interested in investing into his pickle company. Other than that he just disappeared like if they skipped an entire phase before he talks at the auditorium.\n\nAlso would like for him to have had more of a shock and awe at modern day things than what he had, the seltzer bit was amazing.", "It was worse than I was expecting, but I really enjoyed it for what it is. As someone who grew up Jewish the synagogue scene really got the tears flowing", "I thought this was pretty good until the fight at the cemetery. \n\n Ben\u2019s subsequent vindictive actions towards Herschel were just so unwarranted and petty. Herschel should\u2019ve done more to ruin his life like cause him and his girlfriend to break up (if he had one) or gotten him evicted.\n\nBen is such an unlikable main character since he goes way overboard in \u201cgetting even\u201d with Herschel.", "Movie was fine enough. Had a couple of laughs. Best part was spotting the different parts of Pittsburgh it was filmed in.", "Anyone who's new to Tim Robinson and liked him as the erratic lawyer should check out his episode of The Characters, I Think You Should Leave, and Detroiters.\n\nA lot of his comedy involves increasingly absurd and escalated situations where he gets more and more energetic and ill-tempered.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to see the skit, \"**The Pointers Brothers**\" in the Characters episode, at least. One of the funniest things I have seen in recent memory. :D", "It was better than I expected.

It was definitely stronger for the first hour or so, I'd say though.

He was surprisingly restrained. Of course, first you have to be willing to go with the premise to really get any enjoyment out of it. I looked at it as a fairytale story, because when you start to question the plausibility of not just the pickle brining, but every scenario played out in the film (courtroom, pickle-ing process, rise to fame, etc) - you\u2019d drive yourself crazy. I really wished there were more laughs though (with such a crazy fish-out-of-water story, you\u2019d think it would have been a lot funnier), and that they followed through to the end on at least one of the social messages they were trying to satire (politics, religion, fascism, media, etc).", "I enjoyed seeing Seth Rogen play something outside of his comfort zone", "It's a bit meandering, but it has charm and at least we get Seth Rogen lip syncing doo-wop.", "I personally loved this movie. It made me laugh, it made me cry.", "Decent movie, it's not really \"funny\" honestly but clever and heartwarming at times.  Proves Seth Rogan can act and I applaud him for trying something different.", "Tim Robinson stoke the show", "I like Simon Rich\u2019s books, but his absurdist style really doesn\u2019t work when you try to play it straight in a movie. Very mediocre.", "I\u2019ve come for your pickle", "No spoilers, but I hear this is more dramatic than Rogan\u2019s usual work. Should I avoid smoking weed while watching this?", "I agree with a lot of people here: it felt rushed and at the end I didn\u2019t feel as though I had really been given a lot of substance to feel any particular way about Herschel or Ben, or their relationship. Because of this, when Ben was pulling petty stunts towards Herschel, I was more annoyed than understanding. And the same goes for when Herschel pulls his grand schemes off to sabotage Ben\u2019s life. At the same time, I felt like there were several small moments that made me feel sadness for the characters, particularly when Herschel wakes up in our time and finds out his wife has been dead for many years. And when I saw Ben praying in schul in the \u201cold country\u201d, and he is emotional, that was emotional for me too. I wish we had had deeper moments like these, that really felt true to itself and authentic, versus the sort of watered-down dramedy we got in most of it.

The set up is bonkers but it\u2019s original and offers great comedy potential. But then the movie just sputtered out. Its jokes are fairly bland and predictable and the plot settles into a typical fish-out-of-water story. I did like Seth Rogen as Herschel though. It\u2019s the biggest acting challenge he\u2019s had in awhile and I think he nailed it. I just wish the screenplay was at his level.

Only a few funny moments peppering a sea of mediocre and unnecessary dramatic dialogue. Seth Rogan's impression of a turn of the century Jewish immigrant was barely audible and incredibly flat. The comedic greats have been cutting too many corners this year, Will Ferrell's Euro Vision is reminiscent of this - great concept, horrendous writing.", "This movie has a lot of plot holes but the one I take umbrage with is the fact that no app developer spends five years building their app before deciding on the logo.

I mean it seems like Herschel would have really cared about the whole holocaust thing and been super into like the fact that Israel exists based on everything he has said and done.   Not to mention the whole scene where they go back to Schlopsk - like eastern european yiddish speaking communities do not exist anymore because, again, Holocaust.  And not to mention the \"I have to go back to Schlopsk\" idea kinda doesn't make sense because Herschel could have just obtained Israeli citizenship instead (and like I am not trying to start a political argument about the morality of the law of return but like c'mon that is clearly what Herschel would have done).\n\nAlso like really leaned a bit too heavily on the \"Herschel acts like a racist idiot because he is old\" thing. Like yeah obviously older people have antiquated views but like it was kind of pushing that premise a little hard.  Like not realizing people will be offended by sexism and homophobia ok kinda believable but like what about being a jew from 100 years ago would make him think that telling a bunch of Christians that Mary was a prostitute was going to go over well?\n\nEdit: One more thing, though a bit more obscure - during 1920 when Herschl's town was destroyed by the Cossacks, the Bolshevicks were in the middle of committing what was arguably a genocide against the cossacks so they weren't rampaging countrysides at that time", "It was a decent movie.

Teachers (often priests and nuns themselves) tell them that's only for marriage and between a husband and wife. Then you graduate and find out how silly it all is.

Clearly Karen Maine has a bone to pick with her childhood school. It leads to some pretty cringe scenes imo. For one, Catholic school sex ed class is not like that at all lmao. Maine doesn't even get the Church's doctrine regarding sex correct. The Church does teach that sex should be celebrated within the context of marriage, but nowhere says that sex must only ever be for procreation. The line \"you should check out some colleges on the east or west coasts\" was an audible groan moment for me. As if Karen Maine isn't aware that some of the most debauched college party scenes in America aren't nestled smack in the middle of the apparently boring and worthless parts of the country.\n\nSecond, the film made fun of the Kiros retreat which, I suspect, many of the viewers would have actually enjoyed had they gone on one. We had a Kiros-style retreat at my school and the film nails some of the more surface-level elements. The hugging, the corny songs, the \"live the fourth\" mantra, etc. But the film suggests the retreat is a big farce, put on by fake people covering their anxieties with fake cheer. In reality, at least at my retreat, people talked very openly and frankly about all sorts of things: sex, relationships, problems with their parents, issues with drug abuse, suicidal thoughts, everything under the sun that makes teenagers' lives hell. The one good part of the retreat scenes was the parent letters part, which, in my experience, was a very candid and moving thing to watch in person. People's parents telling them they loved and accepted and were proud of them.\n\nOverall, the movie had some very funny nods to growing up in a Catholic school: Mass in the gymnasium, the altar boy's robe showing his school khakis underneath, the whole vibe of early AOL-era internet, etc. In the hands of a more skilled director and writer, I think this movie could've been three times better and more honest.\n\nAlso for a film so obsessed with its own sense of moral righteousness, the film ends with Natalie Dyer's character letting Wade take the fall for something she did. The resulting message is just a very nihilistic one. Fun movie though.", "Didn\u2019t make me laugh really. Felt a bit more drama than comedy to me. Having been to catholic school this all felt super accurate to how it\u2019s like going to a private school. Natalie Dryer carries this movie with her performance and the supporting characters are all fine too. \nLike many people have said it felt pretty short and like the 3rd act was cut down quite a bit.

This has some of the best reviews of the year so far, but to me it felt like the film is pure mood and not much plot. Also at first it surprised me, when the film just ended, but then I remembered the opening scene with Alia Shawkat and understood what had happened. It's actually a pretty cool semi-open ending (meaning, it's not explicitly shown, what happened to the characters, but heavily implied).\n\nOverall, it's a really good film and I hope, it will be re-released in theatres some time in the future.

Perfect movie to watch with a nice angus burger", "One of the most remarkable things about this film is the negative space in the script- there are whole sections where characters say nothing, because dialogue isn't necessary. Instead, the director chose to show, in painstaking detail, the kinds of micro-interactions shared by characters and the little tasks they do to achieve their goal. When they talk about building a fire, the film doesn't cut to them sitting around a fire later that night, and jump straight into expositional dialogue- we watch the process of them chopping wood, preparing the hut and the fire, and that tells us *so much more* about them as characters.

This film was such a fucking delight from start to finish. \n\nOne of the many things I have to praise the film for is just how well paced the first 20 minutes are. You get Nyles and his problems all laid out just in the opening scene alone, him having everything planned out even before the inevitable time loop reveal (the dance at the wedding was pretty obvious toward that), trying to get at Sarah with his casual wedding toast which leads to them hooking up, and when she jumps into the time loop and enters \u201cthe next day\u201d, it\u2019s so well edited from both of their POV\u2019s, I kept smiling the whole way through as to just how on point the whole opening felt.

It made you sympathize with both of them because you would have to get to a point to be where Sarah is at in being stuck in that time-loop for god knows how long and Nyles having already felt those feelings numerous times. \n\nThe second scene being Roy and Nyles having their heart to heart at Roy\u2019s house. It\u2019s a scene not a lot of screenwriters would add, but because they did, it gave them so much emotional heft as to what they have both been going through and having that understanding of the struggles of being stuck in the time-loop forever.

I guess that means they went to a world where he doesn't know them. I wonder if they got together under normal circumstances?\n\nYeah, the grandmother was 100% in the loop too. She'd already achieved her bliss, spending time with her family. Makes her compliment to Nyles there at the beginning really genuine. \n\nThe bartender was great.

I guess other people like her could've been in the loop too in other timelines.", "\"Guess they come back November 10th.\" \n\nHA!", "I saw the movie and loved it.  I have always loved the time loop movies.  \n\nAnyway, is the grandma some sort of architect?

I'm not familiar with her, but I look forward to whatever she does next.

It's a perfect marriage of rom-com and scifi/time travel.

Easily one of my new favorite movies.", "The top review for the film on Letterbox ([click here to read it](https://boxd.it/XRoVH)) points out that this film uses the time loop concept as a metaphor for marriage, which I think makes the film so much better and deeper. The idea that marriage is essentially living the same day over and over again, and like this movie, living it with the same person everyday. It also makes Roy\u2019s line \u201cthere\u2019s nothing worse than doing this alone\u201d much more poignant, as it can be considered as \u201cthere\u2019s nothing worse than going through life alone\u201d. \n\nI love this interpretation, since it just makes so much sense in the context of the story. A time loop where the characters are reliving a wedding, Nyles\u2019 speech about marriage in the beginning, Sarah\u2019s history and feelings about marriage, and the fact that Roy lives the same day over and over again with his unknowing family. \n\nThis will be one of those classics, that in several years people will look back on and say \u201chow did this not win any awards?\u201d", "Here's the script if anyone wants to read it.

Uses the sci-fi trope very effectively to make a relatable movie about young relationships. Nyles is the stereotype 20-something man scared to grow up and leave his comfort zone of living life with no consequences. Sarah, being more matured by virtue of her more difficult life experience, is determined to leave her past behind and move forward, refusing to just waste time anymore. They escape and take the next step in their relationship by doing something scary with no safety or assurance that it will work.\n\nRoy is old enough to realize that the day he has is perfect, and he comes to peace with it (though I am glad that he escapes in the end). I thought his scene with Nyles at his house is one of the best of the movie.", "This movie is so good.

It's not a real brand of beer - but it IS the Hindu name for the World Turtle. One theory of the World Turtle is that it's an infinite stack of turtles (\"Turtles All The Way Down\").

I finally made it early enough to comment on one of these threads! Something interesting I observed about the movie...do you even notice how an average romcom has little to no backstory about the female lead? And her whole point of existence in the movie is for the male lead to have a turning point? I felt a gender-reversal for that concept with this movie. We got to know so much about Sarah\u2019s life and why she is the way she is. We know little to nothing about Nyles life. The film cleverly makes that point right at the end when they are floating in the pool and he says \u201coh I have a dog Fred.\u201d", "What beer is Andy Samberg chugging all movie? I respect that kind of loyalty and need to try it.", "Watched this last night, thought it was great. Now have a theory.\n\nNot only is Nana in the time loop (which I've seen other people say), but she's been in the time loop for far longer - and that Nyles, Sarah, and Roy have left the time loop before. \n\nIf you think about it, Nyles on the first, original, day, walked into the cave to start the time loop. When he and Sarah escaped, we see from the credits scene with Roy that a version of Nyles is still in the loop, but doesn't remember any of it. Therefore, he would go about his day the way he originally did - which means eventually ending up in the cave and back in the time loop. Then he would, of course, pull Roy and Sarah in eventually, and then they would escape.   \n\n\nThis has all happened before and will happen again. This is the only way to explain how Nana knew Sarah was about to leave - because she knows that when Sarah actually gives a good speech, it's the day she escapes. Presumably the first time this happened Nana was in on it, and made the choice to stay behind, and so that's how she can tell when Sarah is acting differently.", "This is the perfect movie for this summer. Nothing feels like it matters, every day is identical so you just drink all day long, you finally have time to >!learn quantum physics!<...summer 2020 in a nutshell", "I've probably rewatched this 3 times in the last day. It reminds me so much of The Good Place, lots of meta & philosophical cues to follow or rebel against but all worthy of a little googling and reading on. The laughter happens but the writing & lines linger long. \n\nI loved when Nyles said, \"Why go back out there when there's death, poverty, and debilitating emotional distress?\" (non-verbatim). He also valued how pain is still very much felt, and that the day may reset yet pain, whether inflicted on others or to self, time doesn't pass enough for it to heal. *\"Your best bet is to suffer existence.\"*\n\nAlso loved how Sarah confronted her need for escape with good old quantum physics. One can say that this film held up a lot of mystic elements with the cave & all, yet only to be solved with some hard science ^((coughs in 2020)) that was *learned and experimented on,* not just your usual aha! moment that involved a true love's kiss, a survival quest, or a search for some magical key token that will save them.\n\nRoy is such a good rep that it's our own psyche that decides whether the situation is terrible or tolerable. The time loop sure is lonely and filled with angry monsters that haunt every so often, but it's also a constant choice amongst all things. Then Sarah came along, made the decision to leave, and helped those who haven't figured it out yet.\n\nNot a philo major, & would really love some insight on this. Nyles & Roy strongly showed Nihilism, actively destroying each other in their void until Sarah, showing Existentialism, came along. At some point they all met in the grounds of Absurdism & Pragmatism. And somewhere along those loops, love happened. \n\nCould be a commercial happy ending, sure. It really helped my mental health too knowing they've outgrown a terrible version of themselves. But it also felt right to know that the risk they took, took them forward. Humanity is so insatiate that we forget to relish time & how it unceasing it is.\n\nThat and, Andy & Cristin & JK should make a character ensemble series. That on-screen chemistry is worth a million bucks.", "This film is so charming. I haven't smiled about life & quotes about it in a while especially at this time, and watching a technically nihilistic film is the least thing I expect to make me feel good today. \n\nI'm genuinely curious though how did Nyles get into the loop? And his job and family, much like we got a peek into Sarah's & Roy's relationships.", "Is Nana in the time loop? I feel like she is. But I feel like she likes it and doesn't want to get out.\n\nedit: read an interview with cristin milioti and she says it was purposefully left ambiguous whether or not nana was in the time loop", "i read the comments here, and nobody has addressed something huge: It is not covered how Nyles found the cave. My theory is that he caught his girlfriend cheating and went off into the desert and found the cave.", "This was a pleasant surprise. I went in expecting a typical rom com and instead I got this really thoughtful and charming sci-fi romance. The cast made this movie work for me. I feel like this movie wouldn't be nearly as good as it is if they had cast anyone else in the roles they had. The cast was phenomenal. The movie also had a great soundtrack. Really didn't expect them to have Kate Bush in there but it worked. The thing I liked most of all though is that it had what I like most in sci-fi stories. It was very much about ideas and it was thoughtful and at times philosophical but it was always grounded by great characters that you can connect to. Underneath all the time loop wackiness, there's a real story about the fear of commitment or realizing you're  stuck in a rut in life or appreciating what you have or coming to terms with your past. There's all this packed into a fun 90 minute movie and it's quite a feat that it manages to do all that while still being funny and not taking itself too seriously.", "I loved this movie and love the genre in general.  I loved groundhog day, russian doll, and edge of tomorrow.  Anyone have any good recommendations in this genre?", "I LOVED this movie\n\nThe only thing left unexplained:\n\nWhy would Niles bring Sarah so close to the cave to bang? He probably had a million better places to go without risking her finding it!", "Really enjoyed this at Sundance and excited to watch again. Anyone know if anything changed between the premiere and now?", "One of the better movies I've seen in 2020. It was clever, heart warming and made me genuinely laugh out loud more than a few times. I absolutely loved it. \n\nHonestly first movie in a long time where I don't have many complaints. I'm not saying the movie is without flaws but like all the really good movies it was so engrossing i was too busy being entertained and enjoying myself to see them so bravo all involved with the film.\n\nIt somehow also had interesting things to say about the nature of relationships without being heavy handed about it. \n\nAlmost wish there was 5 more minutes to it just so I could spent more time with the characters.", "I enjoyed the take on \"find someone to spend forever with\" type of theme. \n\nWhen Sarah first started getting into the timeloop, she would wake up sad everyday, and later we find out also very guilty. But as she falls in love with Nyles, they start to wake up happy everyday since they are spending it together, even if it's the same day.  \n\n\n9/10 it was fun and pretty much what I expected given the budget and all that. The quantum physics was sort of a cop out IMO, but overall I enjoyed it.\n\n\n\nEdit: I also enjoyed all the Ah-ha moments this movie had as you figured things out. How Andy knew to put the chair behind the drunk uncle, how he knew Sarah didn't have a speech, when you find out the Grandma was in the loop hence why she said Andy's speech that day was her favorite yet.", "I went into this without watching a trailer or knowing the plot, I just love Andy Samberg. I absolutely loved the movie. The moment when he gets shot with an arrow and she is screaming \"what the fuck\" over and over was the first time i've laughed in weeks it feels like.", "Was the selfless act Sarah whispering to her sis she banged her hubby to be?", "I liked at the end of the movie, after just escaping the loop, they choose to spend their first new day basically doing something that they probably did together 100+ times in the 'past'. Shows that their relationship didn't need new adventures or a lot of flash; spending time together was enough.", "Probably a very stupid question, but the old lady who had been to more weddings than you can imagine, were we meant to take it that she was stuck in the loop too?\n\nI'm thinking because of that scene where she says goodbye to Sarah.", "My biggest question is, what happens if one wakes up the other right after they fall asleep?", " In a year where every day of the year feels the same, it's fitting that the best film of 2020 is set in a time loop. Samberg and Milioti are tremendous together, their chemistry is one of the best seen on screen in a long time. The clever spin on the beloved concept is boosted through big laughs and a soundtrack to die for. Instead of focusing purely on wacky shenanigans. I appreciate that the film makes you question what you would do in the character's shoes. We can all get stuck in a rut where we accept that we're shitty people, maybe if we live even the most mundane moment to the fullest we'll learn to love ourselves\u00a0again.", "A small musing. Once they break the time loop, it stands to reason that everyone they interacted with on that final November 9th will carry the memory of those interactions through to November 10th. So they'll remember the moving speech Sarah gave about her sister and telling Abe not to fuck it up or Nyles starting a fight with Ted and stealing his pick-up.  \nWhich also means that Spuds will now think Nyles is his long lost son.  \n\n\n(edited for clarity)", "Oh my god, the scene after they have sex when Sarah is looking at Nyles sleeping and just smiling and trying not to fall asleep herself so it all lasts longer - and then both of them waking up in that warm glow of falling in love, all smiles and bliss - just broke my heart.", "They finally gave the mother from HIMYM the love story she deserved! \n\nCristin Milioti and Andy Samberg had perfect chemistry and this was just a delightful movie.", "This far exceeded my expectations, it's great! Great performances by the leads. Cristin Milioti really stood out to me, I hope she gets more work. With a minimal amount of background she managed to sell me on her character's growth. I don't know if this counts as a breakout role but I was super impressed. Movie had a couple of laugh out loud moments and a surprising amount of depth. Highly recommend this one.", "What was up with Nana Schlieffen? She seemed to know that they were leaving at the end.", "Just wanna say that Milioti nailed every single line reading. She was a treat.", "Wow. What a great movie. First movie I've watched in awhile that I could watch immediately again.

Was Nana in a loop too, and wingmanning for Nyles the whole time??", "Andy Samberg was awesome in this. I almost always find him funny, but this movie required some real dramatic scenes. In my opinion he totally pulled it off. I look forward to whatever he does next.", "one thing that i've been thinking about is how nyles (i keep wanting to call him jake lol) has slept with sarah so many times before, yet it wasn't until this specific time that she got trapped in the time-loop too. at first i was like, what made it different this time than all the other times when every day is the same? probably just plot convenience. but then i realized another decision had to be made by someone else who can affect the events of the day: roy, deciding to drive to palm springs to torture nyles SPECIFICALLY by hunting him. so partially in a way, roy is also responsible for getting sarah into the time-loop.", "I thought samberg gave a hell of a performance in this film. Showed some definite acting chops in this. I felt he nailed the nihilistic attitude\n\nMilioti had a great performance too", "honestly one of the best movies i've watched in a while. i think the last time i felt this way was watching jojo rabbit where i couldn't stop thinking about a film. everything from the cinematography to the flawless, hilarious writing was perfect. i think it's also a plus that i have a celeb crush on both andy and cristin hahaha", "There's an after credits scene. In case anyone missed it.", "the movie ends a bit to soon, I had hoped after the blow up they showed the full day again and see if it worked.", "May we all *find our Irvine.*", "I just love that people are still finding new and creative ways to use this really fun basic concept. I'm sure it'll get old someday, but it's still been really fun since they've been diverse in their handling of it so far.", "A rom-com story that feels prescient given the current circumstances of the world, but also a very fun and inventive twist on the \"Groundhog day\" theme that is becoming a genre of it's own.  \n\nIt's been well over 100 days that most of us in the states have been dealing with the limited outside interactions. From going to the office regularly to working from home, not being able to travel to visit loved ones far away. Day after day, everything starts to blend together. There are two sides to the coin of living in isolation, and they are wonderfully explored in this fun movie. \n\nThe first examination is of the couple living together. At first it's great, you develop you're own inside jokes, try to set up new routines, make the lemonade out of the lemons. Eventually, living with another person may feel like a chore, the honeymoon stage ends. You or the other might say something off the cuff that wouldn't normally bother one but the built up tension of only being with each other leads to hurt feelings. Fights may break out over what feel like small things. But you're ability to make best of it, understanding that this person makes you a better person. Accepting the partners for who they are, flaws and all. Understanding that not everyday is going to feel like you're living on cloud 9, but still choosing this life. In the climax of the movie,  the big speech moment really bring home this point. \n\n>!\"What if we get sick of each other?\"\n\n>!\"We're already sick of each other, it's the best.\"\n\n\nThe other side of the coin is living in true isolation. The feeling that no one can empathize with what you're going through. Longing for someone to share your thoughts with. You try to make the days meaningful as they all blend together. You're mental health starts to slip and you may not have the best coping mechanisms for your new reality. You have to come to grips in living with yourself. Finding beauty in the little things. \n\nCristin Milioti, Andy Samberg, and JK Simmons all play their parts perfectly. The blend of their different styles of comedic delivery with some truly heartfelt moments mixed in. Samberg will not be making the jump to movie star leading man with this role, but his comedic timing is enough to keep us engaged in this story. Milioti held her own on screen in each scene shared with Samberg, able to show off her own comedic brilliance. And of course, JK Simmons shines as the grumpy old man hell bent on torturing Samberg. \n\nIn the end each character is only able to escape after self realization. Milioti understanding that her terrible past doesn't have to dictate her future, Samberg learning that life has value even during times that it seems bleak, and Simmons learning to let the hatred go. Only once all three are able to overcome their personal obstacles are they ready to move on.  \n\nI'm probably overthinking this 90 minute comedy but I enjoyed every minute of it.", "I loved this, and I think the central performances really held it up - both leads are so humanly likable, never too-sweet the way romcoms can try to frame leads, never so frustrating you don't want them to be happy. And it really sets itself apart from other time-loop movies/fiction by not being about moral good or finding something to fix.", "First I wanted to state that I loved this movie, and here are a few questions and thoughts  \na. In the mid-credits Roy meets a 'reset' Nyles, unless Roy stops him this Nyles will probably wander into the cave again and start looping again.\n\nb. What happens if one looper stays awake overnight and the other looper falls asleep and then wakes up eventually?\n\nc. I believe the dinosaurs are real and are/were caught in the event horizon of the time loop and get dragged to whenever the cave emerges\n\nd. I think we're dealing with a Multi-verse situation, and at the end of each loop reality splits", "What a great movie. I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like, waking up, reliving the same day over and over again, not knowing what the actual date was. Feeling trapped, almost quarantined by time ya know? It would make you want to escape.", "I was pretty high when I watched the film but I thought the overall message was profound. Like I know it had that science fiction backdrop, but it was really a metaphor to how real relationships work i.e. going through life without someone might seem like an endless black hole where you're doing the same mundane shit day in and day out, but then you meet someone who puts a smile on your face and gives you a reason to get up out of bed every day. But then it gets to the point where you become scared over the prospect of losing that person in your life.\n\n\nI did not know a thing about this film going into it, but I never expected it to get so existential.", "Haven't read all the comments but I didn't see this come up:\n\nI love knowing that the guy with the guns still thinks Nyles is his son.", "I think the dinosaurs wandered into a bigger and slightly different version of the cave in the early cretacious period and have been treading that same piece of remote desert, day by day, for millions of years. Freezing every day during ice ages, drowning every day when it was an ocean, and now walking every day across the sand. But since they're so remote and it's only for one day, no one's ever seen them except for those two people.", "Only thing I wanted was for when Sarah finished explaining her post-montage theory to get out, Andy Samberg would either finish her sentence or say I know and reveal that he had also in the millions of years he'd been looping before her had learned the science behind it but was too scared to ever attempt.\n\nI just always liked the aspects that time loops provide for acquiring almost superhuman knowledge that Groundhog Day had where we learn that Bill Murray had learned things like the piano and different languages, so it would have been nice if they had a few more of those moments in Palm Springs.", "My takeaway from the film's ending was that it was them finally entering and embracing leaving the time loop. In the scene of Nyle and Sarah camping in the desert and witnessing the dinosaurs, the tent could be used as a metaphor for their pocket of looped space, where inside of it they were close, intimate, confined, and relatively safe. Outside is the unknown, or rather things they don't understand or comprehend because it's not a part of their repetitive routine. In reality, the dinosaurs aren't really dinosaurs, but a representation of what awaits them if they ever get out, and I feel Samberg's \"That's new.\" line with a look of confused bewilderment is evident of that theory. \n\nThe ending, after they blow up the cave and are in the November 10th family's pool, Nyle mentions his dog he'd never talked about in the countless loops he and Sarah experienced. She acts incredulous at the idea that he'd never brought this up before, and they both laugh at the idea of it being a shaggy dog. This thought, that wherever they're at now they're together, and even after spending so much time getting to know each other there are still new things to learn about them, is ultimately what the dinosaurs can be interpreted as. They're embracing the unknown and are going to make the best of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOR Palm Springs is just a spinoff in the Jurassic Park cinematic universe and we're all fools.", "Strangest line of the movie for me:\nNana says to Sarah right after she leaves Roy the message: \"Well I suppose that now you will be going soon, good luck.\"\n\nSince there were almost no \"throwaway\" lines in the movie, it makes me wonder if Nana knew somehow what was going on...which opens up a bunch of other theories about the movie...", "Highly recommend this movie. Do yourself a favour and go in to it completely blind. No trailers, no reviews, no synopses. Get the fuck out of this thread and go watch the movie, emphatic period", "Really enjoyed the movie, but confused a bit on the ending maybe someone can help me out. Is the pool scene when the family comes home at a later date back in their new reality and they remember everything? Then mid credits scene Roy realizes he's in his own loop and that's why Nyles doesn't know him?\n\nedit: ope, just went back and watched the pool scene. missed the line where he says I guess they come back November 10th. got it!", "Theory I had that turned out not be true: The actual cause of the time loop was that beer they were constantly drinking from the cans with the strange design.", "Heard a lot of hype about it, so I checked it out. Was as great as the hype. \n\nThoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Perfect combo of funny, sweet, and thoughtful.", "This was much better than I thought it would be. I liked the chemistry between Samberg and Milioti. Simmons was good too. Time loop movies are always fun. Also Cristin is my future wife.", "This movie actually explores pretty deep existential wonders we all have in a way that was humbling", "Do do you think Roy's son eventually created the world's first dog shit tree?", "Can someone please tell me what was up with the Dinosaurs?", "It's just so fucking charming. Andy Samberg and Crisitin Miloti have such ridiculous chemistry. The Groundhog's Day plot has been done to death at this point but I always love it when it's done well. Here, it is done really really well. I can see why this sold for so much, it would've likely been a big sleeper hit at theatres.", "Andy\u2019s dance scene in the beginning of the movie was hilarious", "I liked this movie. My only issue was the switch of character that happened to Nyles after they slept together. It was to sudden and something we have seen to many times before. \n\nWe had a movie where girl chases guy, and is also given this gift to clean herself up, etc. We dont really get any of that. Once they sleep together it turns into a guy chases girl movie. \n\nAt the end he even apologizes to her but it seemed like she was the one who acted weird and ran away. So it just turned into the same thing. Guy chases girl, has speech, gets the girl. \n\nDoesnt ruin the movie completely but I thought it was a much better movie to experience this from her point of view more.", "Very good movie. A great concept that they pretty much nailed. \n\nTime travel movies usually have plot holes and I only saw one in this one, the goat. The goat should\u2019ve been back the next day after she exploded it, but with no memories of her or that day, since that\u2019s what happened to (at least) Nyles.  They could\u2019ve written around that with her training the goat or some other animal somehow, and when it came back without the training she would know it had worked.\n\nThey did wrap up a grim ending brilliantly. Roy coming back and talking to Nyles 1 may have been enough to alter the timeline so that he doesn\u2019t find the cave. Otherwise, Nyles 1 gets stuck in the loop all over again. Now, the 1 versions of everyone end up back in their pretty shitty lived, but the 2 versions at least get happy endings. \n\nGreat acting across the board. Great writing. I think it was a little too to-the-point with the sci fi elements to encourage the theory crafting and what-ifs that leave some speculative sci fi end up burned in your psyche, but for what it was it was great. God bless them for not just leaving the ending totally open ended with a fade to black after the explosion; that would\u2019ve spoiled it for me.", "I\u2019m a little tipsy and missing my long-distance boyfriend so be nice to me you guys~\n\nIt kind of makes me sad that Sarah just left Niles to be sad/wonder where she was for an infinite amount of time while she learned quantum physics. That\u2019s a lot of pain to go through by yourself. Also didn\u2019t she miss him? That part upset me a little, idk", "One cool thing I really appreciated from this was the discussion on the balance of Nihilism and Absurdism. \n\nOne being \u201cnothing matters so why is it worth living\u201d -like giving up and living in the cycle and the latter \n\nAnd the latter focusing on *making* life worth living. Living through the suffering for the next bite of that candy bar. And trying to make a better impact in you and the environment around you", "I really enjoyed the movie. One detail that had me thinking though, \n\nWhen Sarah does the test with the goat, she says afterwards it\u2019s *gone* \n\nBut when Nyles and Sarah do it themselves, they don\u2019t disappear completely while Roy is still looping; they still exist, but they are themselves before they got stuck in the loop. \n\n*So what happened to the goat?*", "This feels like a movie from 2010. Kinda strange in a good way. Really charming and visually fun.", "If the goat wasn't there after she tested the explosion, why were Nyles and Sara still there, but clueless after they got out?", "Benefit I just thought of: they're probably well groomed on the morning of the wedding. You'd have recently had a haircut, manicure, shave, eyebrows, waxing, you name it, if you were in your sisters wedding that day. They haven't shaved in decades, that's the dream.", "absolutely loved this film. i just gave it a second watch and caught something kind of funny. at the very beginning of the movie, we see Nyles and his girlfriend try to have sex. He ends up taking too long and she stops him because she\u2019s in a rush. a few moments later she says \u201cand this isn\u2019t an age thing because i\u2019ve been with lots of older guys\u201d and he says \u201ctrust me, it is an age thing\u201d (or something to that extent). The screenwriter of the film revealed that Nyles had been stuck in the time loop for about 40 years, making him (theoretically) any where from 70-80 years old. Just thought it was a funny little easter egg.", "Best comedy since Long Shot, both happen to be romcoms\n\nExcellent movie, from start to finish. Particularly loved the random gags, like the best man who\u2019s always scared for some reason, or the kid who waters dog shit. The bride\u2019s father was great too", "Anyone else as upset as I was that they didn't go tell Roy about there plan to leave the time loop.  Nyles had resolution with Roy and then just left him in the time loop.  Once they get out of the time loop they disappear from it like the goat did.  So they just strait up left him there in his own hell.  Really rough ending.", "i don\u2019t see anyone talking about the dinosaurs. when they first appeared nyles and sarah were on shrooms so i assumed it was their imagination. and at the end when the family shows up it pans out and there are dinosaurs in the distance. could the family have been their imagination as well? could the still be stuck in the loop? great movie either way.", "Instant classic. Both of the leads absolutely killed it, the pacing never drags, and best of all, the humor all worked. This has to be Andy Samberg's best movie.", "I have to say, I found this movie to be really clever and charming. But there's one question about sharing a time loop that it didn't explore and I wish it did: what happens when one of them goes to sleep and the other doesn't? Can they be woken up again, creating an alternate version of themselves that escapes the loop (since it's established that going to sleep always restarts the loop)? Or are they still unable to wake up outside their own loop, even if it still happens within the other person's loop?\n\nI suppose it's outside the scope of the story they wanted to tell, but it's like the first question I asked myself as I watched the movie.", "I went in blind, that dance sequence in the beginning was absolutely absurd and scary at the same time", "Excellent.\n\nReally surprisingly good.\n\nA nice film well made with love and detail.  Sweet romantic funny comedy.", "Anyone else kinda dislike how Roy was redeemed so easily? Like I understand his role and message in the story, but I don\u2019t like how he was completely forgiven after constantly *killing* and **TORTURING** Nyles", "I've got a question.  When Roy comes back to find a Nyles that has no recollection of who Roy is, it implies that Nyles is out of the loop right?  So that means it's Nyles from Day 01 where he discovers the cave naturally and starts the loop.  Wouldn't this now occur and bring a new Nyles into the loop with Roy again?", "Hm. I'm only 45 minutes into the film, and wondering what happens if one of them falls asleep and the other one wakes them up?", "This was a cute movie. It didn't really move me in a big way but the premise was pretty interesting and there were some legitimately funny cutaway gags. I had no idea what this movie was about and I'd suggest going in the same because I was totally thrown off by the first appearance of Roy.\n\nSeems like this movie is a really interesting allegory for how people look at low stakes relationships, and in that way I thought it was really good. I think there's something to be said about how Niles has no stakes in his life including the many hookups with Sarah, and how messy things can get when you start to develop feelings (i.e. when he brings her into the world) but you still want to keep life uncomplicated and without consequence. In that sense I really liked the ending and how they forced Niles into a commit or flounder situation. I think getting out of the time loop was a metaphor for choosing to progress a relationship and not just always keep it in the \"hangout and vibe\" mode. Something that maybe hits a little too close to home for me. \n\nI also really enjoyed how this angle of the Groundhogs Day situation was more sci-fi. Once I figured out what the movie was I was waiting for the reveal that they had to follow some sort of rules or, like Sarah thought, achieve some sort of selfless status. So it was a pretty good look when the loop got solved by quantum physics. It reminded me a lot of Safety Not Guaranteed with the relationship and sci-fi twist as well as the leap of faith in the end. That said, part of me wishes they had left the end open like Safety Not Guaranteed did. I think the scariest and most exhilarating part of entering a relationship is not knowing where you may come out and I think that idea would have held better if they didn't have that final scene. Would have been cool to just cut to the final Roy scene after they go in the cave. So that we know Niles got out but we don't how it ended up for him.\n\nAnyways, overall a fun and interesting movie. I'd give it a solid 7/10.\n\nEdit: Been a while since I've done one of these. Been weird without theaters. /r/reviewsbyboner.", "Quick question, does Roy now live in an alternate timeline (when he escapes) as our Nyles and Sarah?

I've read some fantastical theories on how space time has been ruptured to bring along dinosaurs from another era. Which have been most interesting to read. My take is this. The first time Nyles and Sarah see the dinosaurs, they are both high as a kite and are most likely sharing a hallucination. They're happily tripping. However, the final scene pans away to show the audience three dinosaurs walking past the landscape at a distance. I'd peg the final visuals to be a metaphoric representation of how unreal breaking out of the loop must feel like. The initial appearance of the extinct creatures was hallucinatory. Sarah and Nyles have been looping for what appears to be a couple of lifetimes. Now that they have escaped, their actual *yesterday* and the life they lived up to the point of the looping would feel as fuzzy and imaginary as the hazy dinosaurs we are shown in the ending of Palm Springs.", "Thank you. This whole nana thing in the loop is ridiculous. She says she has been to more wedding than he can imagne because thats what old people say its its good writing because oh boy does he know about that.

They just need to do a very specific thing in order to leave the time loop, and the time loop itself couldn't care less about their morality or personal growth or crap like that. But Sarah only finds out how to escape by setting the hedonistic fun aside and focus on really, fully understanding what's going on, and Nyles only can leave by making amends and showing his own growth to Sarah once she figures it all out.\n\nIt just felt like a nice twist on everything, a very non-deist approach to it.", "Damn, that scene when Nyles blurted out to Sarah that they had hooked up tons of times before was so ridiculously well written.

So, I understand why they did it, but I think the main message of the comic was that immortality is a curse. It irks me that they just essentially killed the main character, like if they make a sequel, will she not be in it?\n2. The best part of the comic is when Andy reveals how old she is. She wields her axe and declares that she has been on this Earth for upwards of 6,000 years.

It perfectly encapsulates (yeah yeah) the weight of having immortality and makes you think about the eternal physical and emotional pain that can come with it.

Good.\n\nAnd yet time after time we see these incompetent mall ninjas and rent-a-cops getting into situations where they could've captured all 4/5 of the Old Guards and kept them locked down with no issues. Like the first fight where 20 men were shaking each others hands instead of disarming and securing these supposed immortals. Even if the men didn't know they were immortal they at least should've had orders to stay at the ready, strip them of their weaponry, and lock the bodies in a box. They were under surveillance after all. \n\nAlso, even though the Old Guards are immortal the least they could do is wear some protection. They can experience pain and they know wounds take time to heal but they seem to head into places woefully under equipped. Why not swallow a gps tracker or wear some kind of communication equipment? How about a helmet? They know getting shot in the head will make them drop.... and then get captured. Why chain so many plot holes together? Not good.\n\nI do have to say as far as Netflix movies goes this one is watchable from end to end. It feels like they're slowly improving but they've still got a ways to go.

I coincidentally had purchases and read the first volume of The Old Guard comic and after watching the trailer for this, was really skeptical it would be anything other than bad. I was very pleasantly surprised, and am now ticked at whomever cut that trailer. Not that anyone during this pandemic has anything better to do than watch this new Netflix movie. \n\nSome thoughts: \n\n1. Something that's always interesting about comic to moving picture adaptations is the loss of the comics style. The comic series has such a unique visual style and when you remove it and just make it look like all other movies look, something important is lost in the adaptation. So that is a critique of mine. Woulda been cool if they were inspired by say The Matrix or some other films that have been able to successfully pull off being movies/TV while also being highly stylized. \n2. Something that I don't blame them for not doing; casting actors who really pull off the \"I've been alive for hundreds/thousands of years\" look in their eyes. I've seen a few actors do it, playing a vampire or some other version of an immortal and I find it very helpful and impactful for me to see as the viewer. \n3. The gun and weapon play really dope, and I say this as someone who is very picky and very into action/gun-play/fight scenes. Having the group of immortals fight as a unit in the way they did was beautiful to watch and highly believable after all the time they've spent doing so.\n4. However, did anyone else notice a shocking number of reloads? Normally Hollywood almost never reloads a gun, to the point of disbelief broken to pieces. But it's like they did the opposite in this movie, reloading after shooting just one or two bullets. Also for the amount of reloads they did, they never took or had on their person any spare mags. Going into battle? Grab the SMG or pistol, no spare mags and run in. That's how they did it.", "has no one mentioned how Booker betrayed them due to being and feeling so alone? and then his punishment is 100 years alone?

I thought it was a step better than your typical Netflix original, but some parts of the movie still felt formulaic and bugged me:\n\nThe music: Sweet Jesus, I thought the soundtrack was consistently jarring and awful. Nearly every single Netflix movie is the same. It's like Netflix gets paid to feature certain artists, so they have an algorithm that just picks random moments in random movies to use a certain song.\n\nSome parts of the writing were lazy: The character names were so bad. Like \"Oh this dude is from Boston, we'll name him after Copley Square\". Then \"Oh, this character needs to exercise her free will to make a major life decision, let's name her Freeman\" (sidenote: how did Copley know what her last name was? Did she tell him on the car ride to the Merck building? Doesn't seem like a good idea to let an enemy know your last name if you still have family that you care about).\n\nI also didn't really like the villain, he was OVER THE FUCKING TOP. He felt like an intentionally stupid character from an episode of Silicon Valley, not a real human being. Every single day he wore a different matching hoodie under his blazer. WHAT THE FUCK? Also, the way he snatcheed Charlize Theron's ax and held onto it like a security blanket made me laugh.\n\nThe thing with the baklava also felt silly. Doesn't like 90% of baklava come from Turkey? Why did the team seem so impressed when she guessed that it came from Turkey after she already mentioned the type of lemon trees and shit.\n\nSome parts of the action scenes were also very convenient. Like how the first team of bad guys in Sudan all happened to be out of ammo and none of them reloaded before the good guys came back to life. And then when 3 guards \"kill\" Nile later on, two of them immediately turn around and start having a side conversation about soccer or some shit while the third guard goes to check that she's actually dead.\n\nAfter Chekov's window, my other eyeroll was that the streets and sidewalks were TOTALLY EMPTY while all this shit was going down, but as soon as the team drives off there's like 5,000 British people with briefcases parading up the sidewalk. Do they all go to lunch at the exact same time?\n\nThat said, it's way easier to criticize something than talk about what went well. I really appreciate that it was an imaginative movie and I'd be down to see more in this universe. The person who is constantly drowning in the Iron Maiden was horrific, and the world they lived in was an interesting one. I thought the action scenes were well done (even if Nile totally grabbed the gun by the trigger when Theron handed it to her).\n\nI was also slightly surprised by the twist that Booker had betrayed them.

From that point forward, there was a tension that could be seen on the character\u2019s faces every time one of them caught a bullet, and I felt that tension as a viewer.\n\nVery fine acting all around.\n\nLastly, the setup for the sequel was good. I\u2019m very interested in the character introduced at the end and how they\u2019ll explain her mental state. \n\n\n\n8/10", "Hate it when a film repeatedly inserts pop music into action scenes, and it\u2019s worse if it doesn\u2019t fit.

They're mentally linked somehow (I think), there's mostly utter truth between them, they immediately describe their dreams in a way that looks like centuries of routine, they fight literally as one entity it seems and I just got a major buzz that it wasn't just a normal shoot 'em up kind of dynamic. Don't even get me started at how amazing it is that a gay relationship was front and centered and normalised and not one mentioned made of it except to show it. Andy was both wise and weary and sister and mother and commander and friend...and she was definitely more than just buddies with the crazy lady in the metal cage. That's going to be a good sequel.\n\nNot a massive fan of grown up Dursley though. Didn't do it for me.

They aren't bad actors but there isn't a particularly interesting dynamic happening between them that drew me in or made me care... The fight scenes can be disorienting -- the opening fight, for ex, was so dark, high contrast, handheld and largely shot in close-ups... The choreography didn't seem too crazy but to be honest, I felt like I couldn't see it half the time. \n\nI don't know what it is but I'm not a fan of the cinematography overall. Not a fan of the way the interior night scenes are lit sometimes; Very bland look usually. Not a fan of most of the daytime scenes either. I don't know what they did during the color grade process but the highlights always bothered me... The brightest parts of the image sometimes felt just a touch too bright... I noticed this a lot during the flashback sequences. Felt like it was piercing my eyes if that makes sense...\n\nThe absolute worst part of this movie... THE SOUNDTRACK. I don't know who decided on the music but it was a major MAJOR drawback. Anytime I wanted to get into a fight scene, I couldn't... Because without fail -- the absolute cheesiest music would drown out any sort of tension or atmosphere the movie had built up to that point. Complete waste... Charlize would look SO good in some of these fight scenes -- the rundown church one comes to mind -- but the moment that music kicked in, the movie lost me.", "I came here to complain about the soundtrack.

There were a few passing references to other times or the notion of living forever but IMO it could have been more in focus.\n\nBasically what we got was an action movie where the protagonists can heal themselves.\n\nI know it's based on a comic, but I think this would have been better suited to a series where they could go through a few different character arcs and maybe do some good old \"flashbacks\".", "I feel like this movie could have set up a pretty decent franchise by starting in the beginning or near beginning era with Andromache.

And more past scenes of every character may be.", "Just saw it today, this could have been better as a series and not a 2 hour long film even though they're setting it up to have a sequel. We're not given much backstory to help us feel empathy toward the characters though we've seen glimpses especially with Booker and his struggles of seeing his children grow old, get sick and then die, we see his motivation to why he was persuaded to betray his friends. I also like how they had made Andy's character killable as the other characters now have more than them running in chaos and not giving a fuck because they cannot die, now they have Andy to protect. We saw that in the last part of the film on how they made themselves human shields for Andy.\nThe script is nothing to be desired for but we can live with that what I cannot understand is the soundtrack.

The music really had a lot more to be desired. Loved the story and the concept, I must check out the comic now.", "Beginning is awesome (and fight scenes in general). Than the movie is just straight generic. Shame b/c the premise is actually awesome but Netflix fashion, something is always off with their movies, in this case it's like they went 5 maybe 6/10s than said fuck it let's go grab beers.\n\nThe soundtrack though, wtf was in charge of that? That damn near ruined the movie alone, that had to be one of the worst background soundtracks ever, didn't even fit scenes.\n\nSomething about this just seems better fitted being a TV show, which would've been pretty damn cool. Seems I'm not alone in that thinking. That, or as a true movie release with the budget and better fixes for the writing etc, as the story/premise is pretty fricken cool with potential. But, as usual, it's gimped as a Netflix release.", "We watched it last night, haven\u2019t seen the comics and just chose it randomly. We both liked it, I enjoyed Charlize Theron especially. Unlike some other commenters, I thought the soundtrack was great. 8/10 from us.", "I enjoyed it quite a bit. Action movies aren't supposed to be on the same level as Goodfellas, so I never get down about the quality of the acting or writing. My only desire would have been to have a \"heavy\" on the team.

But since it's based on a comic book, I don't mind that there isn't", "Even though they set it up for a sequel, I\u2019d much rather take the story backwards to be honest. Given how old Andy is I would love to explore her past and see how she discovered her immortality, what she did with it, who she met, how she changed over time etc. I found the tiny snippets of Andy and Quynh one of the most interesting parts of the film, especially with the witch trials. \n\nI enjoyed the action sequences and think Charlize did a great job since she did her own stunts, but I agree with other posters who have said the random pop music was jarring and out of place. \n\nI liked the team overall, but gotta say, Niles\u2019 acting and line delivery... not feeling it at all. Totally unconvincing.", "Saw this movie yesterday on Netflix. I feel like it could've benefitted from them doing a few more passes on the script to tighten things up and fix some errors, because overall the plot was lacking and the structure was just bizarre.\n\nFirst problem is that the there's two characters dueling to be the main one: Andy and Nile. Andy, because she's the leader of the group and we start by following her and her team as they get a 'job' to rescue Sudanese orphans who've been taken hostage (how Andy - a thousands of year old veteran - would be naive enough to think the CIA would care at all about Sudanese children is beyond me, but that's an aside). We get fed some bits of info about the group but it feels very in media res here.\n\nBut then we get to Nile, and it's the perfect fish out of water setup, to the extent that I wonder  why they didn't just start with her and introduce the group through her eyes. And they do, to a certain extent, but now we've already been introduced to Andy's group so all the wonder has deflated. I did like the plane scene, though.\n\nSo we have the classic YA 'young girl is recruited into mysterious organisation' setup, but we've already established Andy as the MC so now Nile feels like an outsider. It makes it hard to find a focal point and is mainly the reason why the first half of the movie fell flat to me. Plus, Nile's character (as a result of the story structure) has so little time to develop that we don't even see her interact with any of her family, and barely with her military friends. What does she want in life, what are her goals? We don't know. There are also some other things to nag about in the first half, like Andy walking off a train in Sudan (in the middle of nowhere) and ending up suddenly in Afghanistan with no explanation.\n\nThe rest of the plot is serviceable, even if it's not very original, and it draws some very narrow moral lines to make the bad guys actually bad (because of course it's bad to experiment on people against their will in order to make an immortality treatment you can sell for profit. But what if it wasn't for profit? And what if they asked if they'd subject themselves to experiments willingly?)\n\nThe fight scenes were generally all right, as well as the performances. The film could've used some levity (the premise is pretty wacky, after all), and it was in dire need of more and extended flashbacks to the far past. Highlander was much better in that regard. \n\nAs a last note, the  Quynh story made me really upset with the movie. Don't set up such a big part of the MC's conflict and then only use it for a sequel hook! What the hell??\n\nOverall, I give it a 5/10. Not really super excited to see a potential sequel, but with the state of Hollywood right now with the virus and all, I guess I can't be picky...", "Rather enjoyed this. I thought the cast were all great and that \"hes not my boyfriend\" speech was beautiful.\nThe music threw me off a bit, and Merrick seemed a smidge hammy.\nBut all in all im very much looking forward to part 2", "I mean i understand they need to set the new immortal up as a loner and isolated and so on. but it feels so odd to me that the fellow marines, her friends, reaction to her surviving miraculously is to be.. what, disgusted? afraid?\n\nlike why?? if my closes friend whom i've been in life and death situation with, someone i literally held their throat close hoping they will live, did manage to pull through and heal like fucking wolverine, i would be ecstatic. \n\nthe human reactions in this film makes very little sense. its conflict for the sake of conflict rather than anything reasonable.", "Fun popcorn movie you shouldn't look into that much.\n\nWhat happened to Quynh is horrifying.

During the raid that took Joe and Nicky? Probably before that happened, so did he give their location away? \n\nHim being a traitor really sucked but I don\u2019t know how I feel about the 100 years punishment. The whole point of him wanting to end immortality was because he was alone, and the other two dudes wouldn\u2019t understand because they had each other, so why make Booker live alone again?

They were duped because that rescue mission was deemed \"legit\" by him. They've been living in abandoned churches and mines, not in skyscrapers or penthouses. I think that's enough to show what they think or how they live.\n\nAs for the use of gears or armors for protections, I'm gonna be honest. If I could run headlong to bullets and knowing I'd still be alive afterwards, you bet your ass I would lmao. It was also shown with Niles putting her hand on the fire. I think they literally just don't care anymore. It's their motto. If it's their time, then it's their time.\n\nAlso that whole soulmates thing with Nicky and Joe? Absolutely fantastic. I want that kind of love too.\n\nTldr, I've greatly enjoyed the film. Charlize Theron is amazing.\n\nEDIT: I read the first 5 issues of the comics and I got the tech stuff right lol.

It didn't glorify them, and showed how fucking miserable they all were. Villain was terrible and lots of awkward dialogue out of charlize.\n\nIt should've been more art-piece, leaning towards the horror aspect and ended with them pouring over the board, realizing everything they've actually done was truly for good.. It would've been so fucking brilliant. We don't need to see the rest. Maybe the punishment scene between booker and andy.\n\n..But then they ruined it with the epilogue.

Especially since the current technology we have couldn't even begin to provide an explanation or  a cure.\n3. Was Andy the first or was the other woman that she got hung with the first immortal?\n4. I did not like Nile but she grew on me\n5. I would've shot Copley at least once, ( not a question)\n6. Booker's reasoning of betrayal was so weak minded. If you're going to be  a traitor don't immediately regret your decision as soon as you get caught.

I liked that the action felt more like a war movie battle than the big crazy CGI scenes most action movies depend on today. I also loved all the characters. I just wish there was more time to learn about them. I could watch an entire prequel about Joe and Nicky. It would also be cool to learn more about what they\u2019ve done in history and all of the knowledge they have.

Charlize just doesn't seem to give too shits, and the new immortal character has such a bad actress. The dialogue half the time is cringe, and with such empty delivery from the actors.\n\nAction was generic, and the plot is so predictable and by the numbers. And they barely give enough time and development for the immortality aspect despite it being the entire appeal of the movie.", "With the ratings and hype it was getting I expected it to be far better.\n\nIt wasn't terrible but it felt very mediocre. Kiki Layne was pretty terrible imo, her delivery and overall acting was really poor. Merrick was also a bit too over the top to be believable \n\nCharlize was solid and the action/effects were really good. All that aside it's a 6.5/10 for me", "I guess I got what I expected, a corny, very predictable action movie with pretty questionable acting that overall kept me reasonably entertained. \n\nDid they ever discuss what would happen if someone got their head cut off or body chopped in half? I was expecting Nile to at least ask about that since it was on my mind the entire movie. They could have at least had one of them rocking a prosthetic limb to answer the question if limbs/heads being chopped were permanent or not.

The movie effectively drove home how much of a curse it was. Copley's findings about their impact on the world was a cool way to explain why they existed. \n\nMy pet peeves were mostly minor:  Merrick was cartoonishly evil (it'd have been way more interesting if he was actually altruistic in the \"greater good\" sense instead of financially greedy), dialogue was a bit tryhard at points, and it seemed unrealistic that the immortals wouldn't have had developed some sort of organization filled with people like Copley to support them and build up substantial resources to ensure that they wouldn't have to worry about an iron tomb at the bottom of the ocean. \n\nAll in all a solid action flick, and I'm actually kind of psyched for a sequel!", "I like that they move so gracefully and coordinated during fighting.

The 'locked in an iron cage under water' was genuinely thrilling and horrifying, and I thought the movie was going to go deeper into those sorts of ideas. \n\n\nUnfortunately the \"youngest pharma CEO\" was an extremely limited plot point and villain. It would be more interesting seeing them try to change the course of history for the better and perhaps make mistakes - like a butterfly effect type of thing. \n\n\nI thought the choreography was fine, despite making the soldiers seem like dummies. And as many have said, the characterisation just didn't go deep enough despite there being plenty of opportunity to do so. \n\n\nThe music was *garbage*, end of.

They kind of assume that maybe the audience will already know what they\u2019re talking about, or at least do the research before/afterwards to understand the technical wording behind naval warfare.\n\nI prefer a movie like this. First 10 mins set up the plot (albeit I didn\u2019t really think the love interest subplot was gripping at all), the whole hour and 10 mins after that is straight \u201cedge of your seat\u201d action, then the last 10 mins a bit of a breather to understand what just went down.\n\nI loved this movie, honestly. It\u2019s a very no non-sense \u201cget into the action and pay attention to what\u2019s going on\u201d type of movie that doesn\u2019t let up. Even if there isn\u2019t much characterization at ALL, I think that\u2019s what makes it unique. \n\nThe Germans taunting over the radio sounded hoaky as hell, and that\u2019s about my only major gripe with this movie. BUT sometimes they might\u2019ve been able to do that, and especially because these submarine crews could be out on missions lasting weeks to months hulled up in a tin can underwater, I can see how they might go a little coo-coo in the head.\n\n8/10", "I just saw this. TL;DR: Highly recommended. Go get the free Apple + trial and watch it. Watch Das Boot afterwards for the U-boat perspective.\n\nI'm an active duty USN surface warfare officer and have served on two destroyers. I'm also a big naval history buff. No movie has captured the feel of fighting from the bridge of a surface combatant like this. The movie authentically captures the feel of the Battle of the Atlantic and the desperate struggle to escort a convoy through U-boat infested waters. It's almost like a horror movie as the characters try to fend off invisible predators all around them. I've read the book (The Good Shepherd by C.S. Forester, of Horatio Hornblower fame) and the movie is very true to it. The book's constant but accurate use of helm orders and contact report bearings is difficult for a layman to follow but it was well depicted in the movie and I'm glad they didn't dumb it down. I highly recommend it.\n\nOne complaint I've heard before about this movie is the dramatization of the U-boats taunting the escorts on the radio. This is depicted in the book so it's not a Hollywood addition. I don't know if this actually happened, but the Talk Between Ships (TBS) radio was unencrypted VHF (a precursor to modern day bridge-to-bridge radio) and it is plausible that a U-boat could have found the right frequency to transmit a message. I doubt it really ever happened but it's not completely impossible.\n\nThe book is a great read too and I recommend it for a captain's perspective of fighting WWII on a destroyer. For a junior officer's perspective, read The Caine Mutiny. The best destroyer combat depiction is probably The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors, one of my favorite books.", "I really enjoyed it. The background with Elizabeth Shue should\u2019ve been either expanded or completely cut. There was nothing of substance there as is.", "Did anybody else feel deceived when the movie opened up with that complete drag of a scene in the hotel lobby, only to follow it up with 70 minutes of non-stop naval warfare?\n\nI thought this movie was absolutely fantastic.  I think Tom Hanks' character was a little too specifically-Christian to not be based on a real person.  It was like the only aspect of his identity.  That's my only real complaint though.  Tom Hanks and big ships - what a homerun concept!", "Solid 90 minutes of intense WW2 Naval action, 100% recommended for anyone with even the most mild interest in the subject. \n\nI really appreciate that the film doesn't waste time trying to be a deep, dramatic masterpiece, it knows you're here to see Destroyers and U-boats blowing the hell out of each other and by God that's what it gives you. That's not to say that there isn't any merit in our human cast, there most certainly is, but the focus is firmly on the relentless ship-vs-ship combat and it's done incredibly well. \n\nCould it have been a better overall film with a 2hr runtime in order to flesh out the characters and story? Possibly. But this is definitely a  good example that not all films need to be so complex. \n\nIt's fun, the soundtrack is great and it does a great job representing an often forgotten part of the war. If by some divine miracle it gets the proper cinematic release it deserves one day, then come hell or high water I'll be in line to see it.", "Good action packed movie. Anxiety kept me on edge the whole movie. Tom hanks spectacular as always.", "With some editing, this could have been a great horror thriller. Just rename it \"The Pit\", and focus on subs taking out ships in the middle of the night,  without knowing where they would be next. \n\nSwitch some story telling to make us care about those other ships, and keep the awesome, creepy music whenever the subs were on screen and you have a solid war horror movie.\n\nAs it was,  lots of action but no depth. It was boring because I knew Hanks would live and it was more of seeing how the submarines would be destroyed.", "I\u2019ve watched animated films starring Tom Hanks longer than this film, but it didn\u2019t feel short. It was a very tight film, it introduced the main character, it tossed you into the action, and didn\u2019t let up until the end. It told a very specific story and didn\u2019t linger on details. You can make of that what you want, but I think it accomplished what it wanted. \n\nThat said, I have a hankering to watch Das Boot now.", "Fucking loved every second of this film. Tight, tense and immensely exciting. Wish there were more movies like this tbh.", "I can't speak to the historical accuracy as I'm not familiar with U-boat tactics, but I can speak to the realism of bridge/helm orders. It was DEAD on. I was a surface warfare officer (ship driver) and they nailed it.\n\nHe even used the more obscure rudder orders (meet her which means put on opposite rudder to stop the swing of the ship, ease the rudder which means cut the rudder angle in half).  \n\nThey also nailed the absolute onslaught of information you get while \"fighting the ship\". Input from combat, input from lookouts, input from engineering. When you're trying to keep a tactical picture in your head it's SO draining to take all of that information in and stay mentally on top of it. And to do it for 48 hours straight? Fucking crazy. \n\nOne of the ships I served on was so damn old that we were STILL using sound powered phones just like their phone talkers.", "Thought it was great. I'm seeing a lot of armchair technical-advisors complaining about the accuracy, but it seemed to get the point across pretty well to me.\n\nThe idea that these guys were trying to target subs in the middle of the ocean with a pencil and paper while explosions and gunfire are going off around them is pretty astonishing. Really gave me a new perspective on WW2 Naval warfare.\n\nIt also did a good job showing just how small that ship was. Hanks could be anywhere in about 10 seconds, reminded me of when I toured a ship as a kid and even then thinking \"wow, this is cramped\". And they lived, fought, and died on those ships for weeks or months.\n\nHistory in general seems to be taking a beating right now, so something like this is a nice reminder of how easy we have it today thanks to the bravery and sacrifice of those that came before.", "Fantastic film, had me on edge the entire time. The work put into the lingo and communications between everyone on the ship and even other vessels and the commanding of the ship and all the strategy and tactics of battle shown were insanely on point and you felt the seriousness of how dangerous of a situation they were in the entire time. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how our men could have done that back then, I could never have been as strong enough of a person nor have the mental fortitude to have acted and maintained myself in that manner and have commanded a vessel like that in the middle of a battle. \n\nImagining the real thing is almost incomprehensible. \n\nThis was a fantastic example of what our soldiers went through to protect us.", "An amazing film, one of the best paced I've seen in a while. I'm sad that I couldn't experience it in a proper theater and even more disappointed to see so many comments saying their sound mix was off.

And a few more dialogue lines about \u201ctoo rough for hot food.\u201d Etc...\n\nSure it leads up to the cook being killed and buried at sea, and captain misnaming his replacement.

So refreshing to NOT have character development and tired storytelling tropes.  Just great ships and men doing what they can to survive a terrifying situation.  They could have taken the pre-war \"girlfriend\" scene out and added a little more \"destroyer crew life\" and it would have been even better, but I suppose people are critical enough of the lack of backgrounding.  Yeah, there was a lot of CGI, but that's the deal with naval movies; without it they're just way too expensive to make.  Solid 9 out of 10 from this ship fan!", "I personally loved it. No wasted time explaining who a certain crew mate was or his background of being from Kansas. This was a WW2 about the treacherous crossing. If they hadn't given a name to anyone and went by ranks I think it would have been better. These captains and crews weren't the front line fighters normally celebrated but they escorted all of them over to the fight. It's a simple representation of those guys who took the first shots to ensure the legends we know from military history got to the battlefield and not at the bottom of the Atlantic. It makes yah want to know more about this battle, which I have found not alot of normal folks know even happened.", "War movies with Tom hanks never disappoint. \nThey just show the action and desperation rather than character development.

It was almost constant action, which is exactly what you want from this kind of film.\n\nI have two minor objections. One was the Elizabeth Shue character. I love Elizabeth Shue, but her character added nothing, we didn't get to know her at all, and I think the story would have been better focused purely on the men on the ship.\n\nThe second is the text at the end that says \"during the Battle of the Atlantic...72,200 souls were lost forever.\" It was pretty jarring after the references to the afterlife in the funeral scene: \n\n>\"We therefore commit the earthly remains of [sailors] to the deep, looking for the general resurrection in the last day and the life of the world to come, through our Lord Jesus Christ; at whose second coming in glorious majesty to judge the world the sea shall give up her dead, and corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him shall be changed and made  like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself.\"", "Was the audio kinda fucky for anyone else in the beginning?

I have the benefit of a projector, and the large screen really made the rolling of the destroyer feel strong.

With the enemy AI difficulty set to \"easy\".  German U-boat commanders wouldn't surface and use a deck gun against destroyers.  Their torpedo fuses were pretty good.

That 1 out of 1000 depth charges that finally gets close enough, or some tiny fault on the submarine.", "This movie was a pretty decent, enjoyable watch. Basically does exactly what it says on the tin, which is fine.\n\nIf an entire movie of WWII naval battles with questionable levels of realism sounds interesting to you, you will probably enjoy it.\n\nIt's not going to break any new ground, you basically don't know anything about any character except for the fact they are in the Navy, and you know what?

It side-stepped the expectations I had of it, in a good way.\n\nI loved how much of the film was set on the bridge of the ship, the \"technical\" dialogue, the way Schneider staged the action.\n\nIt has problems - the VFX was pretty woeful, that sci-fi sound effect for the U-Boats was weird, and the entire Elisabeth Shue angle should have been done away with.\n\nBut it worked as a whole for me. Some war films have cutout characters and call that development.

Tom Hanks is great- no surprise there - and one can surely understand his disappointment that this film didn't get a theatrical release, but after watching *Greyhound* I'd say that was probably for the best as it works well as a companion piece to HBO's *Band of Brothers* and *The Pacific* as it's very simple and straight forward plot doesn't have the larger scope of other war films such as *Saving Private Ryan* or *Hacksaw Ridge*.", "The captain gets a delicious looking hot meal with hot coffee while rest of crew looks on hungrily.\n\nRight then - Contact !!

I'm unsure how successful the dialogue was with its adherence to naval vernacular. Usually I'm a stickler for terminology without layman-bombing the audience but this one left me kind of cold. I couldn't really tell you a strong trait of any of the characters due to how strictly the script stuck to the lingo. Even a movie like Deepwater Horizon was able to let character moments shine in the writing while dishing out the oil-rig language.\n\nEdit: One thing I did appreciate about the end though was a nice show-don't-tell moment where Tom Hanks is looking on the jubilant convoy with the triumphant score playing the background and on the surface it's supposed to feel good but Hanks has a very somber look on his face against the sights of so many men celebrating his efforts. The title of the score playing is, [\"But At What Cost?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpGQZ0Jbcnc) and that was absolutely what I felt at the end and what I'm sure Hanks' character was thinking as well.", "I really liked this. Story of the few days told solely through the battle actions. There was like zero extra fat on this movie. It maintained an intensity and called attention to even the brief down moments. Tom Hanks was great obviously. Music was great. Cinematography and just general appearance of the movie was outstanding i think.\n\n\nCouple thoughts, my dad was in the US navy on repair ship around late 60s. He would have loved this movie for sure.  Second, everything about what these guys would do in that WW2 era, with the technology they had, the total ship effort in maneuvering and attacking in these naval warfare scenarios, just absolutely mind blowing. I can't imagine the first hand intensity. It's just all awesome to me.", "If you liked Greyhound, I noticed that the second season of the German/Amazon Prime series \"Das Boot\" is available, wherever you may find it.", "Stephen Graham struggled to shake his scouse accent. To my American friends, is the accent as bad as it sounds to an Englishman?", "I wanted to enjoy this. But, what in the.. ships turning on a dime, Germans taunting on the radio, ugh.. no character development...\n\nI'll stick to Das Boot (directors cut) and Hunt for Red October.", "A movie with Tom Hanks playing as a guy that does his job and goes home at the end.  So if you like Sully, The Post, Bridge of Spies, etc (all of which I enjoy), you'll probably like this too.  It's very dry (ha) but it's only 90 min so it doesn't drag.", "This is probably going to be a super unpopular opinion but I didn't find it to be all that entertaining. I think the root of this issue is that the characters, for me, weren't really characters that I cared about (I think there's a word for this but I can't remember what it is). Because I didn't care about the characters, that led to many of the scenes that were tense for others to appear as not tense for me. In movies that had characters I cared about, during tense scenes I would actively be thinking, \"are they going to make it out of this alive? Will the antagonist win? What's going to happen next?\", whereas with Greyhound, I didn't care about the characters and by extension I didn't care about what happened to them. With the tension of most scenes in the movie being taken away, the rest of the movie appears to be boring, and overall it wasn't a pleasant viewing experience.", "How accurate/authentic was this movie? Did U-Boats surface that often? It appears they could only be detected near the surface.\n\nA sub that is undetectable at night and needs visual confirmation is a far superior enemy than surface ships that only have near range guns and depth charges.\n\nDid the US/UK not have any subs?\n\nHow did they have time for full honor burials with full stop in the middle of a danger area just hours from safety?\n\nThe allied convoy should've been easy pickings?", "Others have already pointed out a number of glaring issues with the movie that I too experienced and ultimately led to an underwhelming experience. But the biggest issue for me was the difficulty in understanding the communication between the sailors. I'm pretty sure most of the audience had no idea what or where the ships were... so ultimately all the tension and great sound effects were wasted. A wider lens to track all the ships and give a wider view would have helped follow the ships.", "Tom Hanks\n\nTomhanks \n\nTohanks \n\nThanks", "Seemed short but I think it did a decent job of conveying what it was like to do that job in that situation", "Not sure what that scene was about with the uboat attacking a destroyer using its machine guns. The uboat deck guns were useless and couldn\u2019t take down anything... my grandfather told me a lot of stories about how he had to handle the deck gun and it was so underpowered. He was commanded to shoot down airplanes a few times when they were under attack and he told me the bullets would pretty much bounce off the airplanes. He got shot a couple times by the airplane fire, all shrapnel from the exploding 20 millimeter rounds(poisoned with nasty shit too), except for on that got him on the hand and he lost his thumb, index, and middle finger. Told me a bunch of stories while I was a kid of him on the uboat. Liked the movie and Tom Hanks wearing the WW2 helmet is always great!", "I really like the score that would play when they would see the German Sub. \n\nThe intensity of this film carries the whole thing because there really aren\u2019t any characters in the film.", "This is like the smart version of those dumb Netflix action movies where plot and character development are thrown out of the window and the focus is on the action. Not my thing.", "It was underwhelming. Was expecting much more on this end. \n\nEnded up not caring for any of the characters.  Eventually was hoping a rouge U-Boat would have sunk the greyhound at the end, because it was too drawn out and not fitting for what was previously shown.\n\nlike the woman at the start, with no emotional attachment, it seems that scene was foreshadowing the whole movie.", "He is a bit old to be playing a Navy Captain. His first command in his 60s, he is at the age of forced retirement.", "What was the point of \u201cEvie\u201d? I wasn\u2019t remotely invested in their relationship", "I really liked this movie.  This isnt a movie about characters this is a movie that wants to give you a good idea what it was like for these sailors.  \n\nThis is a very quick movie for a war film.  Drops you right off almost right away and doesn't let up.  Alot of exciting action scenes show off the brutality of the situation these guys were in.  \n\nThis is my favorite WW2 film since Dunkirk", "Enjoyed it, but wouldn\u2019t be unhappy with another 30-40 minutes for character development. The action was fantastic.", "I agree with the wide range of shortcomings - implausible behavior, poor character development, etc.\n\nHowever several have mentioned u-boats going on suicide runs against surface ships - that's not really what they showed. In both cases they showed the u-boat forced to the surface by fire - depth charge from Dickie in the first instance, 5\" shell in front of the conning tower in the second. Now whether forcing two subs to surface in such close timing is plausible is a valid criticism, as well as why the subs would not just run rather than try to fight it out. Also one could question why the Corvette Dickie was unable to hit german sailors on deck without cover at close quarters meanwhile getting holed several times from same gunners. Granted this Corvette was much more lightly gunned than the Destroyer, but they still out gunned the sub. So criticism is due, but on the right things.\n\nOne thing that left me feeling doubt was a commander 50-60 yrs old getting his first command? Was the navy so short on officers that they would do this? The conversation at the beginning made it seem like he was in the navy for a while, not recently joined because of the war. So what? a second officer on a larger cruiser or battleship? At 60 moved to a destroyer? They were building a lot of ships at that point, and I can't see such a senior officer not going to something similar to the size he previously served on - not moved down to a destroyer on convoy duty. And he did not have shoes that were broken in already from his last ship?\n\nNone of the characters were given any depth - but for the mess steward who we saw had compassion towards the captain.  They touched on the captains faith, and his conflict with sinking subs and sailors - but they did nothing with it.", "From a historical perspective (a real nit), is it accurate to portary a Fletcher class destroyer doing slow convoy escort in the Atlantic?  My understanding is that Fletchers were basically purpose built for escorty duty and other related tasks in the Pacific.", "Not gonna lie - the German taunts legitimately pissed me off, I probably would have gone full 2009 Xbox live vulgar back at the German Uboat Captain.", "Quite convenient how none of the U-Boats fires their torpedoes at night when it'd be a guaranteed hit, and only do it in daytime when they are very close, to make sure the ship can see and turn to avoid them.\n\nDoesn't feel accurate at all.", "I just watched this.  Absolute shit.\n\nThe idea that a German uboat commander could call up a destroyer--underwater even!--and taunt him with prank phone calls was as laughable as it was an insult. Thomas Kretshmann was taking the piss to be sure.\n\nAnyone who knows anything about the War in the Atlantic knows this movie was beyond unrealistic. Uboats do not just surface in point blank of multiple destroyers/corvettes.  The movie sort of shows why, but even then the unrealistic battles just went on too long.\n\nThe caricature of \"tallyho, good show\" Brit on the radio was almost as cringe as the uboat captain.\n\nJust ridiculous, incredibly disappointing. I am saddened that people's ignorance allow this film to get anything other than a very low rating.", "I liked the movie. But what I didnt get: why did the subs go to the surface all the time during the movie, so that the superior turrets of the destroyer could attack them?", "I was really disappointed. I had really high expectations due to Tom Hanks and the WW2 theme. Also, Das Boot is one of my favourite movies. I was expecting this to be the allied version of Das Boot or something. Except the movie was just an action flick. \n\nIt felt like there was no ebb and flow to the movie. Just a steady stream of action. No buildup to crucial parts of battles. It made the whole movie feel flat. Maybe it was because I had just watched Sicario, which was the literal opposite in terms of buildup vs action.\n\nAlso, the whole German taunting bit was a total joke, not to mention the whale sounds when showing the uboats.", "Excellent film that I definitely enjoyed. Intense and accurate in that it just tosses the viewer into the vernacular of the battle, but Hollywood enough to entertain, ie the surfacing u-boats, taunting etc. Great cinematography, great acting. I listened to it on headphones and it sounded perfect, so I wonder if the audio issues some have had are related to the fact that maybe it was mixed poorly for things that weren't headphones. Strong recommend!", "[deleted]", "I get it's a business, but it's fucking lame that it's only on 1 streaming platform. This feels like an indy film in select theatres.\n\nHaving it on multiple platforms would replicate a WIDE release.", "This was dreadful, what the hell was Tom Hanks thinking? There is no realism, no real plot or characterisation. Its not even a good depiction of the Battle of the Atlantic. I really don't understand how Tom could get involved with this after the really good quality WWII stuff he's done.\n\nThe scene where the Germans taunted them over the radio made me laugh out loud. Why was Toms Destroyer charging around doing its own thing? It was established early on that he wasn't in command of the convoy yet the movie constantly shows him giving arbitrary orders to any ship nearby and even contacting the admiralty. The ships bridge had more RGB than my PC. The German U Boats seem more intent on committing suicide than attacking the convoy. I could go on.\n\nReally, really disappointed in this.

People think they are so clever by saying the founding fathers were terrible people. They lived over 200 years ago, times were different. Some of their actions seem unfathomable by today's standards, but the incredible things they did to form America cannot be denied and their stories should be told.

Besides, the constraints of the stage and live performance really give theatre a different vibe from movies.\n\nI am lukewarm on a lot of musicals, but this is definitely one of the top few I have seen.  The music is not really my style (too poppy), but it worked well in the context of the play, and the acting, choreography, and story were all excellent.  I would rewatch it in the future.

Rose Byrne was the MVP but she was given way too little to do. Steve Carell was really good and surprisingly despicable as the de facto liberal good guy.

There is also a secondary message about the inordinate amount of attention we give to national politics and politicians versus the lack of focus we give towards local politics, and I know that I felt suitably chastised enough to look up my own towns upcoming elections for municipal office.\n\nIn terms of acting the movie was decent, I think Rose Byrne stole the show. It definitely feels to me like Stewart was more concerned with getting his message out there than he was with any fancy camera work or editing and something about the earnestness of that drive complemented the central themes of the movie.\n\nThe movie is a $19.99 rental, I got it on Amazon.

Carell is great, Byrne is great, Davis is great, Cooper is great. The commentary on the absolute brain-dead idea of PACs was great. I thought it was awesome. I grew up with The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, this was a refreshing nostalgia trip to a different time when Stewart was on TV saying 'Hey, this whole system is a problem, not just the people the system is promoting.' \n\nThe cherry on top for me was Sasso and the other dude at the end of the movie having a nuanced and educated discussion of the failings of Zimmer's (Carell's) actions. Its another 'Fuck You' to the political establishment that thinks anyone outside of liberal metropolitan areas is an idiot. \n\nThis movie really tries to stick it to the entire political process, Democrats included. In fact, I think Stewart was intentionally making Byrne's character, a representation of the Neo-Republican party, seem *more* interested in reality than Carell's character, who was convincing himself that something other than victory was important. Davis' monologue about election finance and all is just proof, to me, that Stewart was trying to critique his team more than shedding light on his opposition.\n\nI personally think that some people have more a problem with this movie pointing out flaws in the left wing political process, than they do with the actual content of the movie.", "Watched this today and didn't care for it that much.

It kind of bummed me out realizing that something like this could actually happen. I'm not from the US, but have a cursory knowledge of the current American political climate. I'll agree with critics that the movie's satire is largely toothless, but I think I appreciate that.

Steve Carell is stellar as the liberal elite, sanctimonious douchebag, who patronizes and condescends his way to virtue signal his heart of gold. You can tell that Jon Stewart specifically wrote the part for him because it highlights his strength as actor - he's able to play up the unlikeable traits of this character while leveraging his inherent vulnerability and charm. Rose Byrne is a lot of fun, and seizes every opportunity to hog the spotlight and she's definitely the most entertaining character. Chris Cooper is playing a classic Chris Cooper type, offering a lot of gravitas and soulful kindness to an otherwise pretty cynical narrative. Mackenzie Davis plays a pivotal character but wasn't actually given much to do for most of the movie, except to exist as a bit of an exposition dump.\n\nI think the screenplay is clever, and the jokes mostly landed quite well for me, thanks to the talented cast. But I'm not sure if the whole thing was executed/directed as well as it could have been. I just feel empty at the end of it. The movie definitely suffers a bit of tonal confusion and it's difficult to reconcile the glibness of the primary characters and the ultimate good-natured intention of the story.\n\nI think overall, my only lasting thought is that Carell and Byrne have fantastic chemistry and deserve another go together in a better movie?

She really elevates whatever she\u2019s in. Will Ferrell is an Icelandic version of his goofy Semi-Pro, Blades of Glory-type characters, but it works here.

It's tough to not have a tear in your eye by the end of the film. I thought the comedy was actually really funny especially the bits related to the contest itself (such as Edinburgh hosting the contest meaning that the UK actually won the previous year). There is also a lot of great fan service with some excellent cameos in a scene I've already rewatched a couple of times now. \n\nAnyone who is a fan of Eurovision will certainly enjoy this and anyone who likes to take the piss out of Eurovision will enjoy this just as much. For those unfamiliar with the contest it does quite a good job at explaining the concept overall with enough humour to make it a good watch, especially if you enjoy a feel-good story. Will certainly be rewatching and recommending.", "What\u2019s wild is that Iceland\u2019s entry for 2020 was actually a pretty fun song and I think had an actually solid chance of winning had it happened.", "I enjoyed the fuck out of this.

The final scene as the credits rolled of them singing (you guessed it) YA YA DING DONG! was enough to get me really emotional.", "You know what? I thoroughly enjoyed it and was laughing and feeling the feels throughout. Rachel McAdams deserves to be such a bigger star than she is (especially comedically). One of Ferrell's better \"man child\" performances, and that he cedes a lot of it to McAdams is a credit to him.\n\nAs a big fan of Icelandic music, loved the (I think) parodies of several real Icelandic artists, as well as the actual soundtrack.

I was not expecting it to be a cinematic masterpiece obviously, but it was a pretty funny escape.

Scott\u2019s arc is his journey to find the will to be a better version of himself which, as he states in the next scene with his mom, will be a constant struggle for him. That\u2019s why the silliness of the tattoo\u2019s ends with the tattoo of his family and Ray together. It\u2019s a literal visual representation of his struggle to be his best self. What people seemed to have wanted with that tattoo scene, with Scott instead showing that he can be serious about something and act in favour of his better self, not only does happen in the scene, but also in the following scene when he and his mom finally have an honest talk about missing Stan, and at the end when he finally tells Kelsey that he loves her. Those are the first times in the whole film where he is actively expressing himself to others, despite his mental health. He begins the film lamenting that he is unable to properly express himself and thus not being deserving of love, yet ends the film being able to healthily talk about his grief with his mother, and express his love to Kelsey. Whether he had potential to be a good tattoo artist or not wasn\u2019t the point. It was about whether he could express his feelings and thus, care about something enough to actively pursue.\n\nIn all, I actually really loved the film. It is definitely Apatow\u2019s most mature effort, and I found it surprisingly poignant and wise, and it had a strong visual confidence with Robert Elswit\u2019s textured and dynamic cinematography. The world felt so rich and lived in that the length didn\u2019t bother me, just because I loved the characters so much and liked chilling with them. And the performances by everyone where phenomenal, especially by Davidson, Powley, and Burr. It may be my favourite film of the year so far, as well as my favourite Apatow effort.", "Was this the best of the Apatow films? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t Judd\u2019s film, this is Pete\u2019s film. The one reason I love watching an \u201cApatow film\u201d is because he wants to tell the stories about his friends. 40 Year Old Virgin was for Carrell\u2019s career, Knocked Up was for Seth Rogen, Funny People was for Sandler coming back into the realm of stand-up and a dramatic role, Trainwreck was for Schumer and for Hader, and this one is for Pete.\n\nI have a lot of respect for Judd because he doesn\u2019t have to make movies about the people he loves working with, he can easily just make a movie about whatever with a whole new cast he\u2019s never worked with, but he\u2019s not like that.\n\nSo to see him making a movie about Pete and telling a version of his story while having that Apatow feel to it, it made me feel good to watch and I loved it. \n\nEspecially the last half from the fire station to the end credits, that whole last half had so much heart to it that it made me tear up a couple of times. The tattoo, Scott\u2019s apology to his mom, his admittance in missing his dad, and with that final shot of him looking up at the skyline and Pursuit of Happiness begins to play, it wrapped up a lot of those beats and it made me happy to watch. It felt like a story that Pete wanted to tell everyone and was very giving with a lot of it.\n\nI didn\u2019t care about the length of this movie (don\u2019t know why so many people do), I thought it was great. It\u2019s not perfect, but I really enjoyed it.", "I think it was a perfect Friday night movie.

I loved it more than I thought initially, and gave me a fun yet fulfilling journey. Great movie, check it out guys.", "I liked this movie but I feel like if a few things had been changed/resolved it could have gone from good to great. \n\nScott's friend Igor realizes that it's wrong to tattoo a kid but then shits on Scott for not wanting to break into a pharmacy.\n\nTomei's rant toward Burr's character after the pool incident feels like it comes out of nowhere. I understand she was mad at him for putting his hands on her son but the 'you don't make any sense' rant was strange since before then everything seemed hunky dory with them.\n\nThe fighting for tips thing was too unrealistic to be believable or even that funny. His mom isn't wondering why he has black eyes and barely any money?\n\nKinda wish something would have been more concrete with Scott's direction in life. By the end he seems to have matured after getting some closure on his dad, but he's still a shitty tattoo artist with a shitty dream.

Really funny, really relatable. Heartwarming as well. Literally my only complaint is how dirty he does Ray's (Bill Burr) back tattoo. I mean holy shit, Ray trusted him to make a decent tattoo, and Scott totally took advantage of that and completely defaced his back with horrible ink jobs. I was expecting the tat to be really good to show the progress that he's been making but I suppose that scene was trying to tell something different. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps it was saying real change takes time, and maybe what happened was more realistic but still it kind of felt pointless to have Scott in the same sort of situation as the beginning of the film.

He has a rawness/realness. \n\nBill Burr and Marisa Tomei are magic. The movie takes advantage of what they do best. Their scenes together are adorable. \n\nSteve Buscemi and Pamela Adlon are also always fun to see. \n\nThe movie is long. But it's presented on streaming platforms. With everyone binging on Ozark and Tiger King during Covid, I don't see how this is that different from watching 2 episodes of something. The characters and slices of life were entertaining, so I personally didn't mind. \n\nTo me, it ended perfectly. It would have been lame and too neat to see a flash-forward of Scott running a tattoo shop or marrying Kelsey. I like the open-ended route.

I know that Apatow gets criticized for having his films run too long but the film went by quickly and I enjoyed every moment of it. Davidson was unexpectedly really good and Bill Burr steals every scene. Didn't realise this was inspired by Davidson's life and his real dad. Added another really emotional aspect to the movie imo. \n\nAlso easily the best looking Apatow film. The natural lighting and handheld cinematography works so much better than the usual stiff, overtly-lit sitcom look.", "i loved parts of this movie.\n\nThis is Apatows best film since Funny People- and really shows you how far he's come since that one.\n\nBurr was great here, despite that facial hair lol.\n\nI liked Pete Davidson, though he was much better in Big Time Adolescence.\n\nIt felt difficult to really sympathize with Scott at all in this, as the movie really meanders and takes its time. Just when you think Scott turns a corner, he's right back doing the same shit he was doing, making me question what his \"journey\" was supposed to be?\n\nI was totally ready for them to swerve the fireman stuff with him realizing his dream of being a tattoo artist - and that never happened. Nor did he pursue firefighting. Or College. He just kinda...accepts...something? his life, i guess? \n\nhis girlfriend is treated as a literal non factor through most of the film, so i didn't really care- nor did it make sense- when he pursued her. I did not buy that the theme of this movie was him accepting love or romance in his life. It was clearly his daddy issues and moving on with his life, finding a path to take like his father did- instead he just decides to get a girlfriend...really? That was the takeaway?\n\nThe movie has lots of funny moments- Burr and Pete's fight, with Billy Bitch Tits random bullshit he yells, is the highlight for me. Maude Apatow is great, Marisa Tomei still holding it down (s/o to them for actually making me buy that she's a mother figure while still being pretty, take notes MCU)", "I found it enjoyable nothing more nothing less.

It meandered a bit, but that felt intentional, since the protagonist was also drifting.

When he goes to meet up with Kelsey, he still pretty much makes the moment about himself instead of making amends for taking her for granted. \n\nI guess it's redeeming in that it portrays personal growth realistically. You can't really expect someone like Scott to change so drastically in such a short time.", "Add this to the list of movies that cut out scenes from the trailer: when Pete's walking bill burr's daughter to school and thanks her for listening and treating him like a person\n\nEDIT:  multiple scenes actually, like the fireworks and what looked like a disco in the background", "I think it would have been better if tomei played more hard to get and burr wasn\u2019t so quick.\nThe relationship moved to quick.\nChemistry was weird\n\nAnd I don\u2019t get burr kind of hiding the fact that he knew the husband\n\nAnd buscemi not telling him about working with him\n\nAnd pete & his gf had no chemistry.

Wouldn't say it is Apatow's funniest movie but its certainly one of his best. I have a problem sometimes with his movies dragging before the third act and sort of meandering to the end. Felt this didn't really have that issue at all, you COULD maybe argue that a bit with the whole tattoo on Ray but felt that still had a concise direction.\n\nBe pretty honest I was always indifferent to Pete Davidson. Didn't think he was anything all that bad as people said but also didn't think he was amazing. You can see the care he put into this role even if he is just sort of \"playing himself\" I actually thought his scenes with Ray's kids were some of the best parts of his role. Burr was amazing. Thought his character was perfectly written and acted for him to do his thing within the role(LOOK BOTH WAYS!) but also stretch him a bit emotionally. Marisa Tomei was her usual incredible self, I really liked the scene where Scott came back home to see her just having fun and doing her own thing, you really in your head thought man she deserves this.\n\nI did like the technique of this being mostly ambiguous of time. It's soundtrack was not current nor were there any jokes that were obvious to the now(One World Trade and the Hulk hands for boxing but him wearing the  Illmatic and Ghostface shirts could be from 94 or now). That feeling of being in that age and not knowing the direction you want your life to go is something from every generation so felt that was a good choice for them to take.\n\nAlso final thought...Action Bronson cameo 10/10", "I was expecting something along the lines of Napoleon Dynamite. And up until the scene where he gets dumped in the pool it was just idling along, feeling all a bit random and drawn out.\n\nBut the character build up had drawn me in emotionally which caught me off guard. The scenes in the firehouse and the bar were superbly done. The interactions and ad lib flowed so well. By the final scene I was an emotional wreck.", "Bill Burr was fantastic and the main reason I checked it out. I thought a lot of the plot regarding Scott becoming a tattoo artist, his friends going to prison, his sister going to college, and his relationship with his gf were all disparate parts of a disjointed movie. The movie really shined when Scott was in the fire station with the other guys. I think there was a solid story in here, but the meandering detours into other parts of the story detracted from the movie. I also thought the reveal of the shitty tattoo on Bill Burr's back of their family was so corny. What about Bill's two kids?\n\nI haven't seen much about this, but the editing in this movie was not great. Maybe it's due to Apatow letting the actors have the freedom to improv. But the repetition of back and forth shots between two characters in a convo was very noticeable. And it was switching a little too quickly after a line was spoken. I thought it was especially bad for the scene between Scott and his sister after the college party.", "In my opinion, that tattoo being shitty and something that Ray would hate was a bad choice. The tone building up to what it could be had you expecting something heartfelt and meaningful but the actual outcome felt out of place.\n\n I totally thought the tattoo reveal would show us that he actually has potential to do it for a living, but it was garbage and left the ending feeling incomplete in the sense of wondering wtf he\u2019s going to do now. If that tattoo would have been good it could have ended with us knowing that tattooing is what he\u2019ll be doing after the events of the movie. The movie ended with Scott still being nothing. Isn\u2019t he going to be moving out? What the fuck is he going to do?!?\n\nI keep telling myself that he went and got an SNL job while his girlfriend was taking the test.", "I'm surprised so many people didn't like it. I thought it was amazing.", "I really like Pete Davidson, but if you\u2019re on the fence and not sure if you want to spend $20 on The King of Staten Island, check out a movie called Big Time Adolescence instead. It\u2019s streaming on Hulu for no additional charge, and it is almost the exact same movie. Davidson is actually even better in it, because he doesn\u2019t get overshadowed by heavy hitters like Marisa Tomei.", "So after watching the movie I gotta say there are some really good things about it and some bad. Spoilers to follow.\n\nGood: \n\n 1. Pete Davidson is very good in this. Yes he plays himself but as a person he has a self deprecating honesty that is relatable to a lot of people. He's a screw up that pushes people away because he's afraid that he'd be hurt if he got close to somebody and something happened to them (aka his firefighter father dying).\n\n 2. I enjoyed the Staten Island setting, all the accents, and most of the performances from Pete's friends plus Bill Burr and Marisa Tomei. Apatow is always good at getting realistic portrayals from people.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n 1. Like all of Apatow's movies, this one is at least 30 minutes too long. There's a large part of the early build showing Pete being a screw up that couldve been trimmed. The movie hits a lull until Pete moves into the firehouse and starts bonding with the firefighters.\n\n 2. The movie is wildly uneven. One scene Petes mom is incredibly kind and caring to her son, the next shes slamming doors in his face and laughing at him. They build up some belief that Pete's sister is going to have to come home from college and stop Pete from ruining their moms relationship but this is never realized. In one scene Bill Burr sees from his son that Pete can actually draw well, but then we see what Pete has tattooed on Burr's back and its all trash minus the sentimental family photo.\n\nOverall its a typical 2008 to now Apatow movie. It has heart, realistic performances, and makes you root for people but in the end the movie never knows what it wants to be. We never see Pete attempt to be a fireman or a good artist despite teases of it, Bill Burr's character really isnt looked into beyond that hes an ok guy, and I can say theres multiple scenes that wouldve been better off on the cutting room floor.\n\nOverall it was enjoyable.

Always rooting for Pete!", "I saw the trailer for Big Time Adolescence and thought \"wow that looks funny!\", while not paying attention to the name of the movie. Then I read a YouTube comment about Pete Davidson's new movie \"The King of Staten Island\". Then I thought they were the same movie... So I was expecting a funny, relaxing movie and instead got this emotional, serious, heart-breaking at times, movie.\n\nBut I LOVED it! Thought it was very well written and I thought Pete was a fantastic actor. Loved the ending. Thought it was gonna have a super happy ending and instead got a realistic, but optimistic ending instead. Awesome movie.

Just liked the commercials.  Going to discuss some plot points here without spoiling any ending or anything, so read at your own risk.\n\nThe movie was the first time I've seen anything on a medium that I can use as a reference to people that want to understand why I have weird darkass humor and why I have trouble with relationships.  My mother killed herself when I was 6 and my dad split when I was 10, and it fucked me up in weird ways, and I see a lot of similarities in the character, which I assume in some parts is a reflection upon/inspired from his own life experience.  I really enjoyed the film and have a deep appreciation for him making it.  \n\nThe scene where he did the \"your dad\" jokes, specifically, was something I've done with my brother since we were teenagers(but your mom jokes because fuck my dad).  My brother hates it, but I revel in it.  I've never seen anyone even talk about that kind of thing, so I was surprised and somewhat excited to see it.\n\nJust kind of cool to have a similar story represented, as dark as it is.", "I just got chills when Kid Kudi's Pursuit of Happiness kicks in at the end while he looks at the sky and where the twin towers would've been. Read in the Imdb trivia it was to pay tribute to Davidson's real dad. So much love put into this movie. Absolutely fantastic. It's 2 for 2 for Davidson following Big Time Adolescence. Hope he keeps up the good work.", "Can someone get a hq screen grab of that last shot?", "I just watched it, I loved it.\n\nI was unsure how I felt with his friends ending the movie >!in prison!<.  If it's to explain him moving on with life then I get it, but a little more closure would have been nice.", "What the fuck happened to richie. The character essentially just disappeared with no closure. Did he end up being a snitch ? I think thats what was implied.", "I loved it.", "Billy Burr is the GOAT", "My brother was a firefighter, he died with 9 other active duty in a work related incident. Honestly, this movie was pretty spot on. I could relate to everything, especially the ending. Hopeful for the future, yet unsure of where to put your energy. I understand it wasnt for everyone.  But for me, it hit home.", "Can we talk about Kelsey?  I know she wasnt supposed to be a focal point, but god DAMN. What a bad bitch. Knew how to deal with confrontation, knew what she wanted, was chasing her dreams of maling the place she was born better. I wanna be her when I grow up.", "Pete Davidson is gunna be everywhere soon. And you know what, I\u2019m cool with it. Between this and Big Time Adolescence, he\u2019s been rock solid.", "I think the 3rd act is by far the strongest part of the movie and the long journey through Pete Davidson's brand of humor is worth it for the finale.", "I'm about to watch it tonight but man, I had no idea people hated Apatow so much. I haven't seen all his movies but as far as I remember I've liked every one I've seen. Why do people hate him so much? Also I'm seeing a lot of complaints that his movies are too long but I've never felt that other than funny people, but even that was a really good movie. \n\nAnyway I guess I'll see", "I feel like the odd one out for not enjoying it. Had high hopes going in, and the movie started out really strong but completely lost me at some point. It felt 40 minutes too long, and a bit more random and shallow that I expected. I'm sure this movie was cathartic as fuck to make and the performances throughout were stellar, but the movie itself felt really lackluster.\n\nMaybe I'll appreciate it more a second time.", "Not a typical Apatow film, that's for sure. \n\nHe says that he really cares for his characters and that's why he makes his films longer, lol. It was the case in this film all the way.\n\nThe film has a few jokes, and I'm not saying a \"few good jokes\", it literally barely relied on jokes. \n\nPete Davidson was awesome as a dumbass. I think there's a lot to unpack in this movie. Will watch it again 'cause I really enjoyed it!", "Really enjoyed the movie. I felt that the film did a great job of balancing the humor and the drama aspects of the film.\n\nThe cast did a great job also. I personally didn\u2019t find the movie too long because I felt the cast did great enough where I was interested to see what would happen next.\n\nDefinitely recommend this.", "Kinda desperately wish the first half was a bit tighter edited, but the endless summer vibe it's going for works so it's easy to forgive. This is easily Judd Apatow's most interesting film too, it's weird seeing someone try to do that low budget indy look who's made so many bigger films. He almost manages it too.", "I found the film very genuine. I lost my dad at a young age and have felt some of the feelings Scott shows. Wanting to learn the rated R version of who his dad really was, using humor to cope with the loss, and always trying to live up to a sometimes unreasonable expectation. The scene at the end with his mom, where he says he really missed him was powerful, cause I know how hard that simple notion can be to say out loud to somebody.", "I really liked this movie. Not as \"funny\" as Apatow's other movies, but still some funny scenes. More importantly, it was a good movie that got pretty emotional. 8.5/10 for me", "Just finished the movie and while I found some of the performances (Davidson's in particular) to be lackluster I do like the overall agenda the movie had.\n\nMyself, like a lot of people, expected there to be a magic turn around in the third act where Scott becomes a firefighter/great artist/whatever but I actually really like the route they went with instead. Scott was still a deadbeat and had done the bare minimum to start to redeem himself by movie's end.. he didn't really do anything to deserve a more optimistic ending but that's sorta the reality for people like him who are wasting any and all potential.\n\nThe movie suffers from a lot of Apatow-isms but at this point in his catalog it would be more surprising if it didn't have the same fallbacks. Ultimately I think the movie is worth watching but really suffers from Davidson's poor performance, he seemed like a good fit for the character but his comedic delivery just doesn't do it for me.", "It was far from a technical masterpiece but the emotion of the story engaged me more than I had expected. This movie had me laughing continuously and also had its moments that got heavier than expected without overdoing the drama. Easily 7/10 quality. My only major criticism is that the story seemed to bite off more characters than it could chew and I felt a lack of resolution for some of them. As a last note, the Action Bronson cameo nearly had me on the ground I was laughing so hard.", "I\u2019d say worth the $20 rental if you\u2019re a big time Pete or Apatow fan, otherwise worth waiting for a price drop or streaming. I don\u2019t need movies to hit plot points on a formula but idk, everyone always says Apatow can cut 30 minutes and that theory really showed here when a ton of the situations/people introduced went no where. \n\nI suppose you can argue that\u2019s what life is like, and that the meandering feeling paralleled Pete\u2019s characterization, but it still fell a little short of my expectations.", "I absolutely adored this film. People seem to not like Pete Davidson but i believe it\u2019s because they only know him from SNL. I think he\u2019s got good range and a lot to say. I was excited for this film but only in a \u201chave a few chuckles on a Friday\u201d way. But it ended being a great coming of age story from a different perspective than we\u2019ve ever seen I think. They fleshed out the characters really well and the humor really came from the heart. Also Ol\u2019 Billy Back Tats really dug this role I think and put his heart into it. Everybody did it seemed (I have a new appreciation for Davidson and am excited to see what he does next) Freckles is having a big day too with season 4 of F is For Family coming out today. Also....Nobody\u2019s gonna mention Dylan Maxwell from American Vandal being the young firefighter they fucked with for being emotional? Took me a second though too! I\u2019m happy I watched this and if you\u2019re on the fence give it a shot.", "I honestly thought this was great, especially starting with that great opening scene. \n\n\nAlso Billy Hollywood should be in the running for an Oscahhh!", "I have to say... I really enjoyed the movie, unexpectedly. It also resonated with me as someone who also lost a parent (mom) at a young age, and the journey towards healing is just as hard.\n\nCertainly found myself tearing up a little at parts. I think there's something personal that I felt that goes beyond the acting, particularly by Pete.", "I loved it.  I cried at the end when pete is looking out to where the twin towers were where his father died.  I thought it felt very real and personal.  Even the end he is taking baby steps - there is no big Hollywood ending.  I love that the people and setting felt real.", "Is it one of the greatest movies ever made? No. Is it gonna win an Oscar? Probably not. Did I enjoy it a whole damn lot? Yes. Did it warm my heart a little in these rough times? Absolutely.", "If you liked this but wanted to laugh more watch Big Time Adolescence. Shout out MGK as the tattoo artist lol.", "I really enjoyed it and related to Scott (Pete) in a major way. I found my step dad dead when I was a teenager and I had trouble letting my Mum go when she started dating him. He became my pal and we bonded over baking together. My main question is- where do I find the yellow shirt and black shorts with smiling mouths come from? I really loved them and want to buy them", "I enjoyed the movie. As is tradition, another Apatow movie that went on too long. As someone that knows SI very well, the whole lowlife friends in the basement smoking weed, talking shit and pipe dreams of a future thing is so true. It's very hard for some to get out of it.\n\nI just have to say the actress that played Kelsey was absolutely terrible. Tried way too hard on the SI accent and couldn't even get most of the dialect right (easiest word to tell the accent is \"tawking\", and she pronounced it \"talking\"). Decided to google her with the guess that she wasn't even from the US and BAM, England. Maybe Pete had some input and told Judd that no one from SI, or even Brooklyn/Queens, was to be cast, but that was a God awful casting decision and to me it really killed some of the movie's authenticity.", "Got around to watching this last night, was much better than I expected.  When I saw \"co written and starring Pete Davidson\" I didn't really expect too much, even with apatow.  But it was a solid movie.  Was it great? No.  Pete was better than I expected (only ever seeing him on snl) but the movie was carried by Bill burrand marrisa tomai. Everyone was good though, even mause apatow.... Who made me feel realy fucking old because I thought she wa slike 15....because she was a kid in I love you man.... Like 11 years ago..... Aha. \n\nI did like how the ending, although a little lackluster, wasn't an \"everything is good now everything worked out\" ending.   Apatow needs to edit better though.  The movie didn't have enough going on for a 2hr+ movie. \n\nWas it great? No.  Was it good? Sure.", "I don't like that Ray doesn't take responsibility for his actions. Scott may have started the fight, but Ray did not act like the bigger person. He throws him in the pool and then lies to his mother saying he never met Scott's father only for him to reveal to Scott that his father was an asshole. And then when Scott's mother gets mad at both of them, he goes and blames Scott for it all. I do agree with Scott in that it's pretty lame for his mother to want to end up with another firefighter after what happened with his dad.", "The robbery subplot probably should've been cut. Felt like a lazy way to get his friends out of the way.", "I really enjoyed the movie, even though it didn\u2019t look like I would at the beginning. It starts a bit slow, and all over the place, but once you get over the hump and you see Scott evolving into a man after getting to know his father a little bit through the eyes of his friends, and having a father figure in Ray (killer performance by Burr) it hits you right in the feels in a very different and unexpected  way..\n\nMovies don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy of your time. This one certainly isn\u2019t, but it\u2019s a well choreographed journey and it gives a lot of smiles and tears. \n\nLife is a circle, and the beauty is we get to live it!!", "LOVED this movie\n\nSo much heart\n\nPete was good\n\nMaude Apatow was a surprise too\n\nA- overall for me", "I just wish there was more of a definitive ending? The classic staring up at the sky in the big city with newfound optimism and the world at his fingertips  doesnt work when Scott experienced zero character growth.\n\nA last second twist of him signing up to take the city test as the first step as him joining FDNY at least would have been something or a call from MGK saying \"how come you never showed me that Ice flash cartoon you drew\". Or even a marquee for an upcoming open mic comedy show sign up here  that he was looking at and showed interest in. Something. Anything. \n\nIf he closed his eyes on a highway and slammed into the back of a car he would have died the same jobless loser with no aspirations as he was during the first scene", "I really enjoyed the movie in the moment, and laughed a lot, but the farther I get from it the more problematic it becomes. I feel like Scott never really grows or changes very much, he's still essentially homeless by the end of the movie, hasn't started or developed a career, isn't going to school, etc. \n\nAlso there are a number of subplots that just get dropped such as:\n\n* Did he get fired from his restaurant job?\n* His stoner friends are all just in prison now?\n* Rays kids disappear\n* We don't see Scott's sister after the college party, and he never apologizes to her.\n* His waiter friend Zues from the beginning of the movie\n* His art skills? He draws one awesome comic-book character and then that goes nowhere.  \n\n\nIt's waaaay too long. Coulda cut 30 min.", "The I fell into a thorn bush had me crying with laughter. Such a Bronson type of humor too. I think he improvised a lot of his lines.", "it's like a coming of age movie, except the dude is in his mid 20s and not teens #millennials", "Was really genuinely surprised by this. I was innudated by this trailer countless times on youtube, making me skip it constantly and dredging up no interest to see it on my part.\n\nBut I'm glad I did. I found the movie really whimsical and touching, thought the main characters arc was really well done. I think it might be my favorite of Apatow's, and didn't even notice how long it was. I was ready to watch more!\n\nIt's not perfect, it got a little over the top with what his friends got up to, and some of the personal growth scenes were a little too on the nose, but others, like his entire relationship with his gf, were divinely subtle.\n\nI give it an 8/10", "Judd Apatow just isn\u2019t making hits like he used to. It wasn\u2019t terrible, but it wasn\u2019t very funny or a classic.", "The performances were funny and I enjoyed the movie but I expected something a little more structured from Apatow. The movie went on and on and left some things feeling incomplete. The final scene felt sort of like an \u201cok let\u2019s just end it here\u201d sort of thing.\n\nI love an upbeat comedy and in that sense it was good, but the plot and character development left something to be desired.", "I think this is great but King of New York is at least four boroughs better.", "I enjoyed it. It was easy to watch, the performances were solid and it was funny at times.\n\nIt was too fucking long though just like every fucking Apatow movie.", "The mom exploding at Ray doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me. Especially when he explained himself and she just said \u201cyou don\u2019t make sense so shut up and never talk to me again\u201d", "I\u2019m such a sucker for all Apatow films. They\u2019re just such nice, funny, relatable, feel-good films that always manage to stay memorable, and you can chat about all the funny moments with your friends that have seen them too. This was a nice addition to his filmography, an 8/10 from me.", "It is a long movie, but it felt like scenes were missing.  We should have seen Scott tell his mother about Ray's issues instead of just seeing Ray complain about Scott telling his mom.  The breakup feels more random than it should.\n\nA lot of the sister stuff could have been cut, particularly the college party scene.  I think Maud Apatow was trying to do a New York accent, but it didn't work at all.  \n\nConsidering his love life, Pete Davidson must have serious game.  I wish we'd seen that instead of Scott the schlub.  I'm not saying I wanted to see Scott fuck around, but I think he must have some charisma and be more of a pursuer.  If they'd shown that, I'd have a better understanding of why Kelsey was so hung up on him.\n\nThe movie would have worked better if Scott had done a decent, not amazing tattoo for Ray.  I think Scott using Ray as a human sketchpad was supposed to be really funny, but it was just selfish and cringeworthy.  \n\nIn short, liked it but didn't love it.", "I'm not normally a Pete Davidson fan at all, but this movie was really fucking funny. Finally a proper return to form for Apatow after the disappointments of This is 40 and Trainwreck.", "I wish they would have used actors who could realistically be firefighters. I mean they had Steve Buscemi as one.", "I did not expect to like this as much as I did. I also didnt expect it to make me emotional. Pete Davidson was genuinely great. The ending scene really got me for some reason, that glance up at the World Trade. Also, Bill Burr was so good in this, I hope he can land some more dramatic roles, I was so invested in him throughout.", "How are people watching this? Are y\u2019all really shelling out 20 bucks to rent this thing?", "Honestly I really liked this. \n\nI think it was a really beautiful film with some funny moments.", "Does anybody know why they decided to have Scott\u2019s Dad die in a hotel fire instead of during 9/11 like Pete\u2019s dad?", "I don't understand why this film is called \"The King of Staten Island\" I understand it takes place in staten island but I don't fully understand the King reference\n\nIs scott a \"king\" because his father was a fire fighter?  ...Or because he's finding himself and coming of age? Doesn't deserve to be called a KING   \n\nThe movie should have been called, \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" fill in the blank", "qwertyuiop", "Pretty good film.  \nAfter covid happened they probably should have cut this into a 6 part TV show.   \nThen we would be praising it for its short length, not complaining about how long it is", "Wasn't that bad but I do know this:\n\nApatow seriously needs an editor and Pete Davidson isn't the best actor. Also, the movie was needlessly long. Could have cut about half an hour or more from the movie. Burr took way too long to show up and half the movie was just scenes. What I mean by that is it was just people eating, then partying, then filler scenes, then people eating, then people eating. The pacing was weird and overall it wasn't all that funny. \n\nI did laugh pretty good at a few parts, I know that for a fact, but for the life of me I just can't remember *what* caused me to laugh so much. Maybe the way people were eating? I don't know. I did like the kids in the movie and they were pretty funny and I don't usually like children in comedies too much, but they were good. \n\nThe story felt too small for an almost 2 1/2 hour long movie. It had the Funny People problem, where Apatow just goes on and on with needlessly long scenes. \n\nOverall, I'd give it like a 3/5. It was entertaining, but just too goddamn long. Also, props too the Kelsey chick. She was really good and it's nice to see and English actor play trashy East Coast chicks like in this and White Boy Rick.", "Big time adolescence was the better 2020 Pete Davidson movie but this was fine", "[deleted]", "I really enjoyed this film but I\u2019m not sure about the romantic ending. I felt like it was totally out of the blue and not really developed well.", "Honestly I loved basically everything about this. Probably tops Funny People as my favorite Apatow film", "I really liked this movie and Big Time Adolescence.\n\nI've always liked Pete Davidson but after watching his interview with Charlamagne it made me see a different side of him.\n\nI think this man deals with a lot of pain as a result of losing his father at such a young age on 9/11 and I like seeing him finding ways to cope with it. He said he made this movie to help him close that chapter of his life. I wish this man nothing but eternal happiness.\n\nIf you haven't seen his interview and you're interested in understanding his story better I implore you to lend your eyes and ears.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/bJbqiHbusKY", "What's amazing about the final shot of the movie.\nOur main character is staring Into the distance at the court house, and in the background showing the Freedom Tower.

But we so often forget the people they left behind. \n\nAnd here's pete telling the story of the city of where most of those first responders came from, Staten island.\n\nMake no mistake, Staten island is exactly how its depicted in the movie. Its where alot of lower class people live. \n\nThat's why so many of the characters in this movie seem lost. They live in a city with not alot of Opportunites. \n\nJudd Apatow and Pete Davidson did an amazing job showing the community where the first responders come from, and asking the question of why the youth of this community lives in the poverty they do.", "Loved this movie. It reminded me of myself and some of my friends that were stuck in a weird place after school in a small city we hated. Watched this right after Big Time Adolescence, so glad it ended more upbeat. Also felt Pete Davidson was paying homage to his real father and mother.", "[deleted]", "Honestly really loved it. Incredibly heartfelt with lots of good funny moments. Definitely recommend it.", "I guess Im one of the only people here who didn\u2019t like it. I thought Pete Davidson\u2019s acting was distractingly bad. His character was not likable at all, and not in an interesting way. \n\nIt was painfully obvious how amateur he was. Like there is a scene with him and buscemi, which appeared to be improv, and Pete was just giving one word answers, which kind of killed the flow of conversation. \n\nBill did well, I could tell he was acting in a lot of the scenes, but his improv was on point and funny i.e. \u201cyour face is on a nickel in Bolivia\u201d\n\nTypical of apatow movies, I think about 30 mins could have been edited out.", "Pete Davidson just makes me cry man, he\u2019s so funny yet so relatable troubled and depressed he makes me feel understood and this movie was amazing, I loved it all", "It\u2019s definitely a good drama but good lord Pete\u2019s character was unlikable. He wasn\u2019t like a charming doofus you root r to get over his problems. He does a lot of genuinely reprehensible shit that\u2019s hardly addressed again. It\u2019s less a character growing drama and more of an exercise in seeing how many other characters can forgive him. \n\nHis friends took the fall for the robbery, helping him get away scot free\n\nHis fuckbuddy forgives him for using her with one heartfelt talk\n\nHis mother forgives him for so much, despite the scene where she insults him to his face while high\n\nHe causes a hit and run that is never addressed again\n\nThe firefighters are kept in the dark of what a piece of shit he has but because of his Freudian excuse, he\u2019s given understanding by Steve Buscemi. \n\nThis is an A- movie hamstrung by the sheer unlikability of its protagonist, knocks it a whole grade down to a B-. Not every character needs to be likable but you gotta give me something to like.", "Pete Davidson was surprisingly good. I don't care much for Apatow dramedies and this was no exception, less selfindulgent than Funny People or This is 40 but still a rambling mess - I see a lot of people in this thread loved it and that's great - i didn't care for it at all but to each their own.   \n\nThere's probably a very good movie to be made about a young adult who's been allowed to wallow in self-pity by a parent who's overwhelmed by their own but I just didn't think this was it.", "This film resonated with me so much. I have a massive crush on Pete Davidson and already knew his backstory and why he is the way he is, but it distressed me how much of myself I saw in Scott and how he's like every  guy I've dated.\n\nIt made me self-reflect in a way I never have before and I think that's why the film leaves many viewers unsettled, they're unsure how to process it.\n\nPete was playing an amplified version of himself, even Judd said he's hardly a dick in comparison to his character. To think he's experienced the unimaginable toll of losing a parent at a young age - especially under those circumstances - and still come out wanting to contribute to the world, not let his demons overcome him, and try his hands at one of the most cut-throat, ego-crushing, relentless industries (as a teen no less!) is something else; I admire him now more than ever. Paired with all the gossip site fodder and critiquing of his appearance that he has to deal on a daily basis while battling his various health concerns, it's gotta be tough.\n\nThis film is unapologetically raw, puts Pete's worst traits under the microscope and yet I'm an even bigger fan of him after seeing it. I think the reason Pete's so endearing is the fact he's comfortable being vulnerable, talking about the not so glamorous aspects of his life, which is a rarity in Hollywood.\n\nThe only thing I struggled with was the ending when he blurted out to Kelsey that the reason he treated her bad was actually because he loved her (??) Now, I get the whole 'people not knowing their self-worth and being self-destructive in relationships' trope, but his relationship with Kelsey was represented way more fuckboy-like and to be like 'sorry for treating you like shit, I'm actually in love with you' felt a little undercooked from a writing perspective, but that's my only real criticism.", "What a fantastic movie. I\u2019ve always loved Pete\u2019s brand of comedy and I was laughing the whole way through. It got a few tears out of me by the end.

Yes, the main important villain was a rich white dude (and I get it, wealthy imperialists make the lower class fight among themselves), but the cannon fodder is a group of people that basically have as much claim to the gold as the bloods do. Clearly the movie is concerned about the way the US used and abused black Americans during the conflict, but it seems like it doesn't care much for the Vietnamese who faced the same sorts of manipulation and oppression. It pays lip service to the concept \"The American War turned families against one another\" but by about the half way point it kinda just drops that compassionate comparison. Suddenly it's \"Bloods good, Vietnamese bad.\" and never provides a real resolution to the notion that the two groups should by all rights be on the same side.", "I understand everything Spike Lee wanna says for black people throughout the film, and Vietnam is only the background for the whole story. But as a Vietnamese, that background is very wrong, unrealistic, illogical, and shows that his crew was too lazy and did not do enough research about Vietnam.\n\nThe bar scene is cliche. Apocalypse is a real bar, and disabled kid like in the film is unlikely to get inside. Why is he disabled though? Because of the war? He was born in the XXI century. And how the hell can he get firecrackers? They are banned here for years. A beggar like him can afford firecrackers just to throw them at random foreign guys? That scene is bullshit, though I understand Lee wanna portrays their trauma.\n\nBefore that a little bit, the cheers scene is cliche. We did that in many propaganda films. So it may be big for Americans, but not so much to Viet. It feels even forced. We moved on.\n\nTo the floating market, why trying to sell chickens to tourists? That is laughable. How did he know these characters were GI? Once again, it was very, very forced and unrealistic. We moved on from this phase long ago and do not bear hatred towards Americans.\n\nVietnamese in the film are stereotypes. Who are these guys with rifle in the jungle? Cops, military, ex-military? No. Stereotype villains? Yes. I doubt that the government allow people to run around with guns like that, especially involving foreign people (I am talking about these French). You would say they paid under-table money to get into the jungle, and acquire some stupid paper showing at the beginning. No! If the government knows about the area, with these gunners running around, these four guys would never be allowed inside, even with a lot of money. \n\nYou can say what you want, but the Vietnam background in the movie shows that Americans hasn\u2019t moved on and still keeps a lot of prejudice towards the country. I appreciate the messages for black people. But other than that, it is a failure. \n\nOn social media in Vietnam, Da 5 Bloods has become a laughing stock.", "How old is anyone in this movie supposed to be? Vietnam War was like 50 years ago. You telling me that guy's daughter he had with the Vietnamese lady was anywhere near thirty?", "The film was... ok, but my biggest problem is that it lacked any subtlety at all. It seems like Spike Lee must not put much faith in his audience\u2018s intelligence, because everything was explained, including actions, thoughts, and feelings of every character. A better filmmaker would have found a way to deliver their message through better dialogue or story, but these characters straight up pontificate every time the director wants you to know something important about them.", "I'm kind of mixed on this, I liked the performance by the actor playing Paul but there are just parts of this that make no sense, like they go to all this effort to recover their friend's remains and bring them home and one of them is blown up, burried and seemingly forgotten about straight away and another is murdered in some location unknown to them. One of their main goals is to bring their comrades home back to US soil and they end up exchanging him for another two who die and stay there and there doesn't seem to be any scene or beat where they seem to regret it.", "I loved it.

Chadwick Boseman and Delroy Lindo were amazing in this movie.", "Solid first half at least.", "Spike Lee has a few gems and a few bombs in his filmography, and this joint feels like a compilation series of both.\n\nThe first half of this film was very solid. My biggest gripe is when Otis goes to see the girl -- the acting in this scene from her was bad beyond comprehension as to how she got hired. Everything else I highly enjoyed and the stylistic choices I found to be very suitable. The aspect ratio switches, the choice to keep them old in the flashbacks, everything had me hooked. Funny enough, I actually stopped this movie midway through because I had to go to sleep and I picked back up on it today.\n\nAnd honestly I wish I stopped there. The very MOMENT this movie goes to complete hell is when the first guy blows up. It felt like the cheapest route to go narratively to raise the stakes and keep conflict. At this point, I was like \"why the hell couldn't they have just gone home and spent their money, happy ending?\" I liked the scene of getting the son off the mine, and I wish they switched that moment around so it could be the last thing that happens when they're in the jungle -- it would've been a great climax -- then they go home and I would've felt very satisfied. I would've felt they found the gold in an oddly easy way, but hey, better than what happens next. But nope, more unnecessary emotion porn needs to occur.\n\nNow we have to deal with the landmine experts, the soldiers searching for the gold, Paul going apeshit, a double cross from a French man, and a big shoot out that results in most of them dying, and for WHAT? What did any of that add to the film? With the main message being about the war haunting these people and the torture it puts on others, everything had already been said. It turned into a cheap action movie with the dumb twist of Paul accidentally killing Norman too -- WHY? Can't he just be fucked up for the sake of being in a fucked up war, we have to add some guilty conscious bullshit too?\n\nI'm not sure of Lee's intent with the second half. Was it supposed to feel like a nightmare? Like a bad drug trip? If so, he succeeded, but what is that trying to convey? How is it suitable to fit with the first half of the movie which felt fairly by the numbers for a Lee movie?\n\nAnyway, Delroy Lindo was fantastic, but this movie needed another rewrite, and if not, at least another draft of editing to trim this thing at least 15-20 more minutes down. I didn't HATE it, but I am very disappointed because it could've been great all around. Instead, they threw on an extra hour and a half for what felt like no reason.\n\nFirst half -- 8/10. Second half -- 4/10. Overall -- 6/10", "I really loved the scene where the vietnamese kid threw firecrackers at them and they all instantly got down onto the ground with their hands on their heads.

When the character with the pigeon feet was walking backwards holding a gold bar above his head, I knew the time had come, just because of the way it was shot/edited. I think it would have been better if they'd excised the 'landmine removal crew' entirely.

I may have stuck it out, but I was watching it with someone else who felt the same way, so we felt the need to turn it off.", "By the time Jean Reno appears wearing a MAGA hat and a shootout begins that should, frankly, be beneath a film like this, I kind of made peace with the fact that it would never rise above 'pulpy shlock with some potent social commentary'. It's fine. Whatever complaints I had, I'm familiar enough with Spike Lee style at this point to know that he's a little extra, always will be and there's no point whining about it. Delroy Lindo was incredible and will win an Oscar for this role.\n\nEdit: One outright negative I will talk about that has been mentioned elsewhere in the comments - this film's depiction of Vietnam as a country today is fucking bullshit and felt borderline irresponsible. I realise Spike Lee just wanted to make an entertaining movie that focused on the experience of black soldiers, but when it comes to the Vietnamese people, you have to make a choice - either present their country as a lawless hellhole and them as stereotypes, **or** constantly use archival footage and photos of their slaughter. You can't have it both ways, and the latter comes off as exploitative and disingenuous when taken with the former. I respect Spike Lee intention to depict the horrors suffered by America's black soldiers, but it rings hollow when he does the same old American colonialist bullshit and uses the country as a hollow backdrop and the people as props for the story he wants to tell.\n\nBut here I am complaining about Spike Lee's style exactly like I promised I wouldn't when I initially posted haha", "Clay Davis searching for gold in Vietnam with Lester Freamon?

It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect from a Spike Lee Vietnam film, in the best way possible. Some scenes are predictable, some themes that he wanted to get across are too spelled out and are only sometimes distracting, but overall this is an important, powerful movie that I highly recommend. \n\nThe editing choices made throughout the movie are unique, but they work.\n\nObviously, given the timing of release, this will be a huge hit, but I could see this being a film that will be remembered for a long time.", "The mine scene was the dumbest thing I\u2019ve seen in cinema in a while. \n\n*watches someone literally get blown to bits from a mine on a mine field then immediately turns around and steps on one*", "I'm sure out of the 2k comments on here, someone's brought it up, but I really liked the use of Aspect Ratios.

There's a lot I didn't like about this movie but hilariously the movie corrects itself. \n\n1. Weird drastic shifts in tone / Amazing message!\n2. Generic lifetime movie music / The BEST use of Marvin Gaye I've ever seen. Amazing Capella choice. \n3. Generic forest and hotel sets / Beautiful cinematography.\n4. No explanation for the Trump supporter and it feels forced / Surgically compares the today's situations to the '60's.\n\nI felt I was watching a combination of Tropic Thunder, City Slickers, Apocalypse Now, and Born on The 4th of July.  I'm trying to make sure that I'm not biased to liking this movie because of what's currently happening in the U.S but I think this is just one of those films that shines exceptionally when it works but still has some major problems.  I really really wish Spike Lee was more consistent but he's also clearly a genius.", "I stayed up late to watch this last night and wish I hadn't bothered.\n\nFrom the director's credentials I was expecting a poignant, relevant tour-de-force of social commentary. What I ended up watching was more like a poorly lashed together and simplistic adventure movie with some social issues nailed on in a failed attempt to give it some gravitas and meaning.\n\nHistory lesson aside the film is poor. While I did find it reasonably engaging at times the storyline is basic, often predictable, clumsy and relies on a raft of ridiculous concidences in a failed attempt to make it \"work\" (quotations because it doesn't work at all).\n\nThe acting is often a bit ropey, the characters somewhat one-dimensional and stereotypical. I found the use of the same actors in the flashbacks confusing since they looked pretty much the same despite there being around 50 years separating the two sets of events.\n\nI didn't find the content of the story itself conveyed any particular moral message and found the main storyline of effectively a load of blokes going to retrieve gold they'd stolen diluted / undermined the moral high-ground demanded by the film's historical content.\n\nThat said I accept the suggestion that taking the gold was somewhat legitimised since it belonged effectively to the oppressors of the protaganists; although you could also make an argument for it belonging to its intended south-vietnamese recipients who were effectively paid off by the CIA as a convenient ally for fighting their ideoligical war. Perhaps that's another somewhat deeper angle - that despite the passage of time two groups of people once explolited by a world superpower are still divided through conflict over the riches it used to do its bidding.\n\nBottom line this appears to be a film of two distinct parts; a really low-grade adventure flick that misses the target on most counts, interspersed with a serious history lesson on oppression and exploitation that carries a heavy moral message.\n\nWhile I can appreciate the desire to convey the historical / moral message in an accessible mainstream film, its gravitas and legitimacy are severely undermined by attaching it to such a mediocre and clumsy vehicle as provided by the fictional part of the film. It seems that the historical content has been added to this treasure-hunting caper in a misguided and somewhat tasteless attempt to give it some legitimacy, which largely fails.. to the extent that combining the two seems disrespectful towards / devalues the serious moral argument it's trying to push.\n\nIt seems almost akin to editing a Carry-On film with historial cut-scenes of the women's rights movements and trying to sell it as a legitimate analysis of gender inequality, or perhaps trying to push a Roger Moore Bond film as a serious deconstruction of geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe grounding of the film in the historical interludes suggests it wants to be considered a serious commentary on war and race; however falls well, well short of this and comes absolutely nowhere close to the classics of these two genres.\n\nRemove the historical references and the director's perceived gravitas and what you're left with is a 4/10 at best, straight-to-video quality, instantly-forgettable caper that would have been too long at 90 minutes - let alone its sprawling 2.5hr duration.\n\nWanted to like it, instead found it misguided and disappointing. Really can't understand why it's had such good reviews in some quarters, other maybe that due to fear of criticising it given the current relevance of the message it tries but fails to deliver..?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the upvotes - nice to see I'm not alone!", "It feels like I'm the only one here who wasn't bothered by the CG blood. I mean, c'mon, is it really that big a deal?", "I can understand some of the knocks against it but I thought it worked well as a buddy squad movie about comradery and friendship. I liked how Vinh and the minesweepers became part of the squad and how the old guys still knew how to throw down Rambo style when the bad guys tried to jack their gold.", "Can someone explain to me what happened to this movie? I was looking forward to this movie, and the critics are going ballistic praising it, but I was ultimately let down. I agree fully with Spike's message but it was about as subtle as a jackhammer in your living room. Give the audience some credit Spike, or he must think his audience is dumb as hell. It made the dialogue in the movie seem so unrealistic and sometimes corny.\n\nI would've excused all that considering the good message he was trying to get across, but then the mixed messages later on in the film?? I mean I am all for realism, and showing how f'ed up and confusing the world can be, but it just became a muddled mess that never led to a definitive conclusion.\n\nDelroy Lindo once again proved he is an underrated, talented and brilliant actor. The same with Chadwick.\n\nMy favorite scene was the Hanoi Hannah scene, it reminded me of what Spike does best, although it did feel as though he was ripping off his own movie; Miracle at St. Anna.\n\nBut seriously, was it the four different writers? Was it that it was originally supposed to be an Oliver Stone film? Cus that what it felt like;  Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino, and Spike Lee all getting into an editing/writing piss fight and reconciling on something that doesn't completely hold up.\n\nI still stuck with it all the way through hoping it would become coherent, it wasn't a terrible movie.\n\n6.5/10", "I was blindsided by how disappointed I was in this film. Its pacing, character motives, and plot convenience made very little sense to me.

Especially in a film so aware of (exclusively American) race relations. I have not seemed it mentioned in any of the American reviews I read, that seemed more focused on the civil rights themes of the film and how it relates to current events.  \n\nAny thoughts?", "The only cliches missing from this movie was someone falling in quicksand and someone getting leaches on them.", "Overall liked the film. Definitely good acting from the main old guys. And contrary to a lot of people, i did like the old actors in the flashback sequences. It's a different take and weird at first, but it made sense since they used that old time footage filter on the shots. Delroy's story was the most interesting and probably the best acted of all of them. The plot itself was quite intriguing and the exploration of what the Bloods went through during and after the war was done pretty well. Also thought it was cool that they found a mixed race actress to play Otis + Tien's daughter. \n\nThe things that I didn't like were that it was quite lengthy and not really subtle at all. That plus the convenience of everything just showing up at the right time- for example:\n\nThe son just happens to meet a volunteer with a mine organization. That same explosive mine organization just happens to show up right as one of the members explodes after finding the gold. The Vietnamese dudes also just happen to show up right as the white guy runs away from the camp.", "What the fuck was the point of the french land mine girl?  She reminded me of female characters from Segal or Van Damme movies, just a female presence that brought no substance.  They just happen to be in the woods when the son steps on the landmine?  There were several parts of this that were just campy and stupid.  The 60's, 70's music was great.  But the orchestral parts were pure cheese at times.  It felt one part like Space Cowboys or Wild Hogs, and another like the Expendables.  It had some nice moments, and some good acting, but it could have been so much more.", "This movie was ok. Sometimes it bordered parodylike war film and I am not sure if it was trying to do that.", "The movie has a great start. I was deeply impressed by the scenes where historic photos of the war were recreated. Most shots of modern day Vietnam (Saigon streets, floating market, bars) were very accurately done. All references to the war were mostly well selected and spot on.  \nThe movie felt too long for me. I kept checking the time and got distracted by my phone near the end. There wasn't enough of character development for me to develop a lot of feelings for them. Paul was heavily portrayed as the bad guy that when he died, it just felt like a relief.   \nThat being said, I appreciate the movie for mentioning the children of U.S. soldiers that were left behind after the war. This group has always been neglected by both sides and having a tough time living in Vietnam. OK, some goof trivia: The conversation between the mother (Tien) and the daughter (Michon) after she met her dad for the first time was very unnatural, especially when the daughter said, \"Tell me the truth. Finally.\" and \"You owe me this.\" They were literal word-by-word translation from those 2 English sentences and nobody talks like that in Vietnamese lol", "Man, I both hated and loved this film. The acting by Delroy Lindo was phenomenal, he carried a lot of this movie for me. The stand out scene was the PTSD scene on the boat, I felt the panic in Paul and it was an incredibly strong scene.

A lot of people here are both overpraising and also over-hating the film.\n\nThe writing was a bit mediocre, some plot points were super thin, there were a few major cliches and the editing during the action scenes was not that great, the soundtrack choices for scenes were very poor (a huge exception is the scene with Marvin Gaye singing). Also the fact that the film portrayed Vietnamese in such a negative light was pretty shitty.\n\nAnother issue I had with the film was the graphic historical images/videos throughout the film. I think they are extremely important to the film and definitely make it more impactful - but when I was watching the opening scene I was just not expecting to see a real execution. Once I knew that things like that were going to be in the film I was fine but I think a warning at the beginning would've been nice to have.\n\nWhile this movie had a lot of bad, it also had a lot of good - the cinematography was gorgeous, the acting was amazing and the writing for the dialogue was actually really good.

I don't think it was anywhere as good as BlacKkKlansman. But I thought the highs - Delroy Lindo's performance, Marvin Gaye's vocals, the Vietnam flashbacks - were really high. The lows weren't incredibly low, but they certainly dragged the film down a bit. I think it could have been 30 minutes shorter and cut the Netflix-action-shootout third act and really just been tighter. \n\nBut I give BlacKkKlansman a 9.5/10. I would probably give this a 7.5/10. \n\nOne thing I don't think I've seen mentioned too much is the framing of the Make America Great Again hat. When Paul first puts it on, we don't even see it. Someone asks if it's a MAGA hat. From then on (and I could be wrong), but most shots have the hat backward on Paul's head or the sun or lens flare blocks out the words. \n\nIt isn't until toward the end of the film that we get a really good look at the actual words, \"Make America Great Again.\" And that's when the Vietnamese guy takes it from Paul, when Jean Reno wears it, and when he throws it on Otis.

The editing was bad all around, the score (sans Marvin Gaye) was generic and overbearing, the pace was jarring, and a lot of it felt like an old person buddy movie a la The Bucket List.\n\nThis is the first Spike Lee movie I\u2019ve seen so maybe I have to watch more and get used to his style but I thought the highs were high but there were a ton of LOW lows.", "So Scorsese got heat for bad de-aging in The Irishman. What do you think about Spike\u2019s non-attempt at de-aging? I\u2019m about a quarter the way through and it\u2019s a little distracting seeing senior citizens fighting in Vietnam.", "Damn. This movie half sucked but was half good at the same time. The editing was so fucking all over the place and inconsistent. It was like it WANTED to have this stylishness to it but only every so often, so those weird repeated cuts that showed up here and there felt so out of place. \n\nThe score was also god fucking awful. I guess they wanted to emulate early hollywood shit, but unlike a Tarantino film, it doesn't know how to utilize it. It felt cheap and corny as absolute fuck. The soundtrack on the other hand was alright. I love Marvin Gaye, but the point his music served was just to be a cheap walking montage cause I guess Spike doesn't know how to address a passage of time more creatively. \n\nAlso some of the acting was fucking terrible. The main 5 Bloods were all good (Delroy Lindo fucking knocked it out the park), but literally everyone else was just utter trash. I mean goddamn, that one chick is really smiling after learning about David's dead mom and only a couple hours after her friend-with-benefits just got blown to smitherines. The only good Vietnamese actor was the chicken dude and the radio chick. The rest were either bland or embarrassingly bad. David was corny as fuck. \n\nThe shootouts also had zero weight to them. The score didn't help whatsoever when it's just a loud ass, typical hero song that we've heard a million times. It wasn't realistic, nor was it over the top. It was just generic and boring. I also didn't believe one fucking second that any of the actors were in an actual fucking warzone. \n\nHowever, this movie still nailed some shit. Essentially every seen with Paul was phenomenal. The counter-twist where we were all expecting them to show that Paul murdered Norman selfishly, to find out it was just an accident was really well done. Chadwick Boseman also killed it as Norman. He definitely had some corny moments, but it was still believable. \n\nAll of the mine shit was done well, save for Eddie's death. That was so fucking obvious. \n\nAnyways, the message was still very strong and felt sincere. There were a lot of fucking problems with this movie but overall, it's fine. Sadly, there's nothing necessarily memorable about this film, though.", "I don't know if this was Spike Lee condensing every trope of Hollywood Vietnam films into one giant criticism in which case it was a success, or if it was actually sincere in which case what the fuck happened?\n\nIt was almost like watching two completely different movies glued together in the middle, right up until Eddie dies and then some stereotypical Hollywood \"old soldiers win\" type of deal, and to be honest it was the first half that I found to be the better movie. \n\nDelroy Lindo was exactly right all the way through, even with the letter monologue but everything else of the ending just seemed kludged together.\n\nThis is either exactly what he was aiming for, or has completely missed the mark and to be honest I don't know which it is but I don't think I liked it either way which I'm sorry for because I came into this absolutely ready to love it.", "Wtf? This felt like an amateur college class project. Wow. I was constantly taken back by the awful editing and script. But god forbid you dislike this movie though because ya know... politics.", "Quick question: is this film in 4K HDR?", "Did anyone else draw a connection between Otis lying on the ground saying \"Madness\" and Major Clipton's \"Madness\" scene at the end of The Bridge on the River Kwai?", "This is the first hard miss by Spike Lee for me personally, and it's bothering me somewhat because Spike is probably the first director that I knew the name of as a child. I didn't relate to him or his movies because of any arbitrary attribute that we both possess, I related to his movies because they took me to places I would not have grown up in, and shown me what those places were like for those that inhabited them. I hope that this isn't him losing a step because I grew up on his films, and always deeply respected him, and his visions despite all the shit he would get for being unabashedly \"pro-black\" in his films.\n\nI only saw what he was trying to do in the Vietnam War scenes in retrospect. I loved the choice of using the actors in their current ages in flashbacks without de-aging them or using a stand-in, I only wish that it had been made more clear that it was a flashback, and how memory never de-ages us in those, rather than it being a story element showing us the past as accurately as possible. I love the choice of intersplicing culturally important figures, while some felt entirely appropriate within the context of the moment, a couple felt incredibly out of place, and shoehorned so much that I worried that the film was attempting to be a \"cool\" educational film.\n\nI feel that if Spike had introduced the story, the part of the film following the Ali clip, with a camera focusing on Delroy Lindo's face staring off at the hotel before he begins walking towards, and then past the camera, and following just behind him as he entered the hotel, and until he arrived at the hotel desk to meet with the rest of the bloods that it would have better put me in the mindset that he is the \"main\" character, and it would not have felt so disjointed, and jarring when the story alternated between his PTSD, and the rest of the story. It set the film off on the wrong foot from which it never recovered.\n\nAlso, unless I missed it, and any possible clues implying the twist, when were we led to believe that Jean Reno was ultimately going to be the bad guy? I was under the impression that everything was simply going wrong, and that the accusation he was involved was the direct result of irrational thinking due to the shock of everything going wrong.\n\nI feel like the message with the bloods dying over the gold was supposed to be that no one was innocent and that no one deserved that gold. However, that was quickly discarded at the very end when people got their checks. I feel that the ending would have been much stronger if no one ended up with a share of it.\n\nAlso, what the fuck activists? Jasper P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen dies, and they don't seem to really give a shit, unemotionally asking \"So, we get a cut, right?\"\n\nDelroy Lindo's character was the only character that was believable, which was ironic given that he was supposed to be the most broken, and destroyed. His decisions made the most sense given his character that he was portraying.\n\nOverall, I felt that the story was at best passable but, the execution of the story was so weak that it drug down the film, and choices such as the deaths from landmines made me laugh heartily when I should have been shocked. The deaths felt more comedic than serious.", "The only problems I had were a bit major for me. I thought it was weird that when Eddie died, no one really anguished in pain or lamented. No tears shed for a fallen brother even if hes blown to bits. \n\nI attributed this to the fact that they have PTSD and that over the years they have become desensitized to pain, death and suffering, as evidenced in Paul's frequent dreaming of Norman (guilt). \n\nBut really?? Considering the fact that these guys have a serious bond toughened by war experiences I assumed it would have been way more hurtful to them.\n\nBut in a way this might be genius. War is dysfunctional. Correct me if I'm wrong but a more subtle message is that dysfunctional things and arbitrary chaos arise from such events?? Vietnam was a disaster and extremely chaotic and brutal. Though their bonds are forged in steel, they are forged in brutality, coldness and blood - with war, perhaps their humanity has been forsaken. The group is dysfunctional because war is dysfunctional. If so, genius move.\n\nAlso, as others pointed out, it was weird and a bit dumb how at one point, David is friends with Hedy at the bar, then when they see each other, Paul takes them hostage. Theres a lot of tension right after with Hedy taunting David. Then in the middle of the night when they take the gun away from Paul, they seem much more amicable even though the LAMB trio are literal hostages who only wanted to do good. Even they arent let go. If I was taken hostage, I'd definitely be pissed and continue to do so. \n\nAnd then after they just seemed like friends, even after Seppo got blown up by a mine (in a predicament he wouldn't be in if it were not for Paul). But I do appreciate that this bit got a bit more emotional as Hedy and the other guy cried over Seppos death, but similarly to Eddie's, they got over it really quickly!! And they dont have PTSD or fought in a war.\n\nVinh was my favourite such a chill cool guy... is it normal to be casually willing to fight against a militia with the high risk of dying?\n\nHave to say that I loved Marvin's songs being woven throughout. Love the album so the moment I first heard the first song I smiled. Such a significant album with meanings and lessons echoing today. Similarly, I thought the flashbacks were cool.\n\nOne thing I didnt really like was that Norman was meant to be a well-respected figure who past down lessons to the Bloods. He preached compassion and love, but this wasnt strongly demonstrated. Do I just assume this is because of PTSD? Perhaps also taking into account these guys are tired vets who have perhaps become a bit senile in their old age (which is common). This might then be a very good decision by Spike \n\nActing was good, especially by Lindo. Boseman is naturally charismatic so great casting. Many themes woven through and many messages could be interpreted, the most obvious being about racial injustice but more nuanced ones being about bonds forged in war, human nature and fragility of morality.\n\nAll in all, enjoyable casually but doesnt even tough KKKlansman.", "Say what you will, but this is easily the best Spike Lee directed Vietnam caper movie ever.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I loved this flick, and I\u2019m surprised to see so much negativity in the opinions being posted here.", "I think the most compelling aspect of the film for me was the fact that it wasn\u2019t a definitive pro-Black film. \n\nYes, there were major elements of the film that were meant to uplift and glorify the Black community: the stock footage of important actors and agents in the civil rights movement, the whole \u201cBlack people were and are victims of systemic racism\u201d narrative, gorgeous use of Marvin Gaye\u2019s music, etc. \n\nBut the film also presented many issues that the Black community may consider uncomfortable to confront and speak about: PTSD and mental health in general, emotional sensitivity of men towards other men, their own xenophobia as Americans, etc. \n\nAnd for this to be released when BLM sentiment is at an all-time high, imho, makes Spike Lee one of the bravest directors this year. \n\nCinematic execution aside (sound, dialogue, aspect ratio changes, etc), I fully expect this to get at least one or even a few nominations in major categories in film awards this year.", "I think this is one of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time.\n\nFrom the pacing, to the editing, to the weird unresolved story lines, to the tone deaf score - this movie sucked.\n\nWhat the fuck was Spike Lee thinking?\n\nI love Spike, and I think The 25th Hour is one of the best flicks of the 2000s, and obviously Do the Right Thing was a masterpiece, not to mention all of his other great works...but holy shit this was just awful.\n\nDown vote all you want, but man, if you haven't see this and are thinking about it, save yourself 2 1/2 hours and watch something else.\n\nI'll say it again, this movie sucked.", "Without Delroy Lindo\u2019s performance I think this would be a drawn out, average buddy heist flick with civil rights overtones. He really made the movie for me, but overall not Spike Lee\u2019s best work.", "I really wanted to like this movie but... Terrible editing, crappy action sequences, soundtrack felt off, cringy side characters... I loved the main cast but it felt like they had little to work with. Everything in this movie felt off and disjointed. Coming off from Blackklansmen this was a huge letdown.", "this is surely an adventure, a great anti-war movie.\n\nDelroy Lindo was great, these last monologues were crazy. i actually like the opening montage, Spike accidentally made a movie exactly for these times. and it's crazy how messages of Angela Davis, MLK, Mohammed Ali, Malcolm X as well as Marvin Gaye's music are still relevant today.\n\ni'm kinda surprised that people here are weirded out by the usage of slides, Lee has been doing for a long time.\n\nand that little after credits scene with the whole crew doing \"sheeeeeeeeeeit\" was wholesome lmao.", "There's an after credits scene where the entire cast and crew do the famous sssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiittttttt", "This movie was filmed like something from the 70\u2019s and I just loved that.

Because she'd have to be around 50 if the timeline matched up?\n\nEither way, their reunion at the end was super cliche... especially since that was the first time they'd ever acknowledged each other. I know Tien technically kept them apart so he wasn't exactly a deadbeat but the scene didn't really work for me.", "I picked up three things from this film: Lindo deserves an Oscar, Lee is far more versatile of a director than he probably gets credit for, and Vietnam War movies can still be new and interesting.

Holy shit I was seriously not expecting the dude to get blown in half with both arms ripped off. If I was taking a drink at the right moment I could easily see myself spitting it out to that scene.", "my only criticism is that Eddie\u2019s death was obvious and i was already expecting someone to step on a mine after the metal detector scene when they find the gold\n\nI like Spike Lee\u2019s filmmaking a lot, specifically the mix of documentary style cuts to real history within the narrative. He doesn't water down his message and that\u2019s a HUGE problem in movies today.", "Y'all ever seen a Spike Lee Joint?", "Is there a list of all the Apocalypse Now moments in the movie?\n\nFirst shot of the huey\n\nThe Ride of the Valkyries\n\nSign in the bar", "Man, I understand Paul was meant to be a complicated and deeply wounded character but fuck they make it hard to like or even sympathize with the guy. He comes across as a real piece of shit throughout most of it", "[deleted]", "Delroy Lindo\u2019s one takes really sum up this movie for me, just a passionate masterfully told story. Obviously a bit more polish is needed in some areas but the soundtrack with the isolated Marvin Gaye tunes were amazing. One of my Spike Lee favourites for sure and feels very much needed today with America\u2019s socio-political climate. A cold reminder of the past.\n\nAlso, the shot where it hanged on the dead babies picture drives home this movies mission statement, the differing views of a immoral horrible war that was better left alone.", "Liked it, didn't love it. There are some extremely powerful scenes in this movie (Delroy's POV pieces, the BLM scene near the end) and some phenomenal acting (especially Lindo), but as with a lot of Lee's films he can't really get out of his own way as a filmmaker.\n\nI thought the war movie parody flashbacks were amusing the first couples of times he did it but it ultimately felt like recycling a gag that wasn't really that clever in the first place.\n\nAlso he's not a naturally gifted action director and the final setpiece in particular was really rough and sloppy looking. Hated the obvious CGI blood and muzzle flash throughout; despite the gorgeous cinematography it gave it a bit of a VOD action-thriller vibe.\n\nAlso thought it was odd that all the subtitled non-english dialogue had the letter of every word capitalised for some reason.\n\nI'd give it a 7/10. I think Lindo and the cinematography should get Oscar nominations but this feels a bit sloppy for a Best Picture contender IMO.", "Man, I am of two minds here, I love the concept and how it relates to black culture, the war and old timers coming to terms with themselves. But the execution in some parts was really god awful. The pacing of this movie is extremely strange. Some scenes just carry on for way too long until it\u2019s uncomfortable. When the son meets the French girl we find out she is a landmine specialist, I knew a landmine was going to come into play, especially when using the metal detector, I kept waiting for it to happen on that hill and it didn\u2019t. \n\nThat would\u2019ve been a natural place and an exciting place for it to happen, at the height of finding the gold but also something awful happening at the same time. But instead they go to a whole different scene, and the guy who hasn\u2019t talked the whole movie hardly, starts on this monologue, and the direction is so weird because you know something is going to happen, they start framing him by himself and he\u2019s walking backwards to get into \u201cposition\u201d. The characters even comment on it! Like the directing was super bad sometimes. It felt like watching a bad stage play. \n\nRight when the son steps on it, that girl appears, I\u2019m sorry, give me a fucking break. They should have had someone else step on it, and the son run back to the Village to get the girl. But that\u2019s not even the biggest issue, they like immediately start talking strategy coherently and their best friend just exploded. Like as if it didn\u2019t happen at all\n\nAlso some of the musical scores Felt strangely similar to black Klansman, which gave this underlying weird tension throughout, when really nothing bad happens until the landmine scene, so I thought it just had a strange tone.", "[deleted]", "Did anyone else think it was odd the old guy actor who gets blown up was born in 1963. This would have placed him between the ages of 5 and 8 at the historical periods this movie flashes back to.

The movie has this old american colonial mentality. Spike Lee is american after all. A movie about racism that reproduces racism is a disservice.", "It's like 2011 youtube did the VFX on this movie", "War movies are probably my favorite genre of film, and a Spike Lee take on what happened in Vietnam is a compelling proposition so I've been looking forward to this one.\n\nAfter watching it however, I didn't like it as much as I hoped I would. There's some choices that were made that I don't agree with, but I can kind of respect. I found the flashbacks to be distracting and immersion breaking. The special effects felt cheap, and I don't know if that was due to budgetary reasons or wanting to portray these memories through some sort of stylized lense, but it seemed off when contrasted with what was otherwise pretty great cinematography. Same goes the characters not being de-aged in the slightest in these flashbacks. Again, probably an artistic choice, but seeing senior citizens fighting alongside Norm took me out of these moments.\n\nI had a hard time with Paul's character. He's obviously a very deeply wounded man, but at the same time was so quick to turn on everyone including his son. While i understand the damage that was done to him, his portrayal was all over the place. He fights for his son to get a cut of the gold, then disowns/abandons him, dies, and leaves a letter gushing about how he'll always love him. How quickly he turned on the LAMB crew after they helped save David was also a disappointing character development. Generally I found Paul to be a very difficult character to sympathize with, and eventually the others were too in their willingness to go with whatever Paul wanted to do when it came to violence and taking hostages. \n\nThe interactions with the Vietnamese felt very cliche, and I didn't understand the purpose of the scenes with the one-legged panhandler. Why would a panhandler waste money on firecrackers just to throw them at the same people who gave you that very money? It's just confusing.\n\nOverall, the premise is great, the message is timely, and it's the acting was good but the inconsistent presentation and odd character development hurt my enjoyment overall.", "Delroy Lindo.", "Thought it was phenomenal. So timely and relevant. Delroy Lindo gives an all time performance imo and I was really impressed with Boseman and Majors as well.", "That was definitely a Spike Lee joint, and I loved every minute of it. It definitely gets kind of predictable and wacky in the second half, but the filmmaking, performances and ideas that the film presents are top notch. \n\nWithin the first minutes, Spike does what he does best and bluntly tells us what he wants to discuss for the next 2 and a half hours; like the Double V campaign\u2014black soldiers having to fight for freedom overseas and at home\u2014or how hypocritical the US was focused on optics of winning Vietnam and the space race, while simultaneously ignoring the plights of African-Americans on their own turf. \n\nI even thought having Delroy Lindo be a Trump supporter was an interesting decision that added to the dimension of his character and the development of the story. \n\nOverall I thought this film was great all around. If Spike Lee\u2019s style isn\u2019t your thing then definitely skip this one. But this film continues to show me that Spike Lee is an ambitious filmmaker who not only loves movies, but loves using that platform to have important conversations; and he\u2019ll always be a hero of mine.", "To people complaining the movie is overly political and heavy-handed.... It's a Spike Lee film!", "Great scene at the beginning when they\u2019re in the bar walking towards the camera dancing and having a good time", "Poorly written screenplay, cartoonish and over-the-top, unrealistic depictions of Vietnamese people, and why were most of the shots so wide?

Bad filmmaking didn\u2019t do the theme any justice.", "the discussion thread, not unlike the movie, is a tire fire.", "Anyone else find the audio was all over the place in this movie? The mixing seemed terrible.", "Lot of comments here saying they hated the movie, which I honestly didn\u2019t expect. The qualms about the script and story I can understand; the movie felt about half an hour too long and the \u201ctwist\u201d still managed to feel half-baked. But the cinematography was actually pretty well-done, not to mention the actors\u2019 performances really pulling through.\n\nAnd to the people accusing the film of being pro-black yet anti-Vietnamese, I believe that may have been a conscious decision from Spike Lee. We\u2019re supposed to notice the hypocrisy from the get-go as signaled by the inclusion of Paul\u2019s character being a Trump supporter. The only issue is that this hypocrisy is never addressed throughout the film at all on the surface level.", "Honestly it's pretty underwhelming to me given the critical reception.", "Really enjoyed the movie, surprised me", "Anyone notice the French weren't tied up after they spent so long tying em up?? Lmao", "The  film left me with mixed feelings. The ending is NOT explained. The  treasure is not clean, legitimate money up for the taking which is why  it was to be laundered by the French guy who gets killed. Once he is  killed, Lee cuts to a somewhat later time in which the US stamped gold  has somehow been cleaned up and used for very visible donations and  gifts (BLM, a group for those affected by Landmines in Vietnam, etc.).  We also see an official funeral for Norman. Is it likely that millions  of dollars in US stamped gold would be used so  visibly and overlooked  by the US Gov't?  Since the French dude can't help them out from the  grave, how exactly are all the murders (committed for the money) covered  up? How do the survivors just glide back into the normal world outside  the jungle and wind up with checks for 2 million here and 1 million  there with no questions asked?\n\nI  think the feelgood morality of the ending is tacked on without much care  or thoughtfulness. For one thing, the journey back to the heart of the  jungle of Vietnam tears everyone apart. Even when one of the \"bloods\"  dies in a tragic explosion while lecturing the others on how to use the  money for reparations, nobody even cries or grieves. Hostilities most of  the parties to this treasure hunt build to a bloodbath crescendo. Then  after Otis cries out \"Madness!\" A fairy tale ending commences replete  with social justice donations based on the gold that has revealed the  inner demons still at work in history and the souls of the characters  embodying it. It may be a positive moral sentiment to end on, but it  does a disservice to what is actually a very dark cinematic journey into  the interior of a jungle in which they both came together yet were  simultaneously torn apart. In sum, the ending feels magical. I've looked  everywhere online to see an explanation for how this money is cleaned  and used to write millions in checks to individuals and charities. Nada.  Maybe someone here can explain it. And even if there were an  explanation, it would still be a 180 degree turn from the anarchic  struggle for loot to high-morality. Didn't feel right.", "The trend over the last several years has been towards every movie being 2.5 hours long and in almost every case tightening them up significantly would help immensely. Cut this down to a lean 100-110 minutes and you'd have an infinitely better film. I enjoyed it but it definitely lagged and was saved by universally great performances. Spike Lee is an incredible actor's director and it shows here but damn the film is bloated and a bit of a mess.", "This was a fucking terrible movie.

I disagreed with virtually every choice of camera angles, cuts, and editing. Terribly stereotyped characters hurt the underlying message of the film; wooden dialogue all around, pacing all over the place, zero research done on ensuring settings, war scenes, or Vietnam in general were accurate, some scenes so ridiculous (the tropic thunder-esque- landmine scene comes to mind) or coincidence-driven I started believing it was all some weird practical joke from Spike Lee.\n\n  \nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I actually really liked the \u2018Tarantino-style\u2019 civil rights asides, but IMO that and some Delroy Lindo monologues is all that keeps this from being a B movie and complete bomb.", "Probably one of my absolute bottom movies ever made (that I\u2019ve seen obviously). I had high hopes, but it felt like a rushed project made to make a deadline to fit the current BLM events or something.\n\nMost times I couldn\u2019t tell if it was a comedy or if it was just poor writing, it felt like a parody of something I couldn\u2019t put my finger on, and it was thoroughly uncomfortable to watch.", "My only guess is that the current social climate may have some critics afraid to speak out about this film, because the movie is legitimately bad. It felt as though Tyler Perry tried making a Quentin Tarantino movie, with terrible cinematography and very awkward/nonsensical score and editing. I had very high hopes going in, and couldn't wait for it to be over barely past the halfway point.", "This movie wasn\u2019t good at all. Terence Blanchard\u2019s score matched up in some scenes but it just sounded awkward. Specifically in the first battle scene when they were at war. At least the cinematography in the combat sequences was Generally good, but it didn\u2019t make up for the rest of the movie. It felt rushed and without any sort of style discernible from other contemporary films that at least had some sort of \u201clook.\u201d Idk why I was expecting a black Vietnam war epic in the same vein as Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. That would have been a dream come true. Unfortunately, Spike Lee isn\u2019t that revolutionary of a filmmaker unless he\u2019s trying to get a race related point across. Since he\u2019s probably the most celebrated black filmmaker of all time, it\u2019s understandable why he would use this platform for that reason and there\u2019s nothing I would do to detract from his wanting to do so. I think that\u2019s great. On paper, this is good shit. The conceptual side of it and the themes are excellent. But the way he executed the story and dialogue etc made me feel like I was watching a fuckin Kevin James movie. \n\nMost of the characters were annoying. Why did there have to be a love interest for the son whose presence barely made any sense as it is? Why did Isaiah Whitlock Jr. have to reprise the character he plays in the Wire for a Vietnam war film? Overall I thought the acting was pretty poor. It added some interesting character dynamics thankfully, like Clark Peters\u2019 character finding out he had a daughter, but the direction was so fucking sloppy that it didn\u2019t make me care enough about what happened next. Plus Spike Lee\u2019s confusion as to what kind of genre he was going for made me see the film for what it was; one that used African American vernacular English  as a crutch to incite cheap laughter.", "Anyone else get King Lear vibes from Lindo's rants in the jungle?

On one hand, I do like the performances that these people gave (for the most part, anyway- there were definitely some scenes that fell apart and I couldn't wait for them to move on). But, I think this movie was trying to do too much, if that makes sense. Messages related to PTSD, racism in America, and corruption felt kind of rammed together and as a result very muddled- as individual subjects they work well, but when put together in this film everything feels cheapened. I can see where they were trying to go but I felt as if they never quite got there (I DO think this is a powerful film, though). Also, I felt like the pacing/tone was kind of a mess- there were a lot of points where I didn't know how  I was supposed to feel about a certain situation, some parts that went on for too long, and some parts that just felt skimmed over. I desperately want to like this movie because some aspects of it are genuinely good, but I don't think I could recommend it to somebody else.", "i laughed so hard when clay davis jumps onto that fucking grenade it just looked so dumb , overall the movie was eh dragged on way too much", "I just don\u2019t get why they wanted to bring back Norman\u2019s remains but were so quick to bury the guy who stepped on a mine", "[deleted]", "One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

It also felt incredibly real with the relationships between the 4 main characters. I get a feeling that the flashbacks also completely went over people's heads. They were romanticizing the past with Norman. Spike Lee isn't saying it was ACTUALLY like that. \n\nThe irony in people belittling his filmmaking and not even grasping his messages due to sheer ignorance, is staggering.

It was one of my most anticipated movies and it delivered. While watching the movie, I just knew there would be a shit hit the fan moment and once they mentioned landmines I knew it was coming soon and that some group of \"bad guys\" would threaten the Bloods. \n\nMy biggest predictions were Paul succumbing to his PTSD, and revealing him to be responsible for Norm's death. It was scary as hell when he took the LAMB crew hostage and forced everyone to tie them up. Idk why the hell Otis gave him the gun to prove a point cause I knew some shit was gonna happen sooner or later. Anyways, it was tragic to see his downfall and I'm glad he found peace with himself. \n\nFor a Spike Lee movie, I always kept my eye out for any symbolism and theres a lot to unpack. Like many Vietnam movies, it acknowledges just how fucked up Nam was. Those real scenes hit hard. Not to mention how some Vietnamese people still hold Americans accountable for the war (\"You killed my mother and brothers\"). I like the the parallel where Paul denies that on the boat, but when the leader says \"you killed my brother\", Paul at peace with himself says yes and it was wrong. \n\nOne of the things that kept me thinking was who deserved to get the money. Paul and the group who attack the Bloods both to me represent extremes to that answer. Both demand it as reparations from the war. Paul is callous and will let nothing get in his way for whats his, and the \"bad guy\" group demand it for their country and will kill for it as well. Meanwhile, everyone else wants to help their family or the greater good (BLM, and LAMB).\n\nI've already written a lot, but one piece of symbolism I wanna mention is Otis at the end after they shot his shoulder. The MAGA hat is on top of him, while he's all beaten, near-death, with his hand on his chest making it look like he's doing the Pledge of Allegiance, while he says \"Madness\". The movies still fresh in my mind, but if I had to quickly theorize the meaning, its that the \"madness\" that hat represents (racism and hate) will be responsible for black people being hurt, beaten to near death or killed over and over again in this country. I may be reaching but I would love to hear anyone's thoughts.", "I'm actually a big fan of Spike Lee's films but this one was a bit lukewarm for me. There's a lot of good ideas and things I like, but despite the brilliant concept, I just don't think Spike Lee's heart was really in this one.

It is also a bit too long for its own good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is still worth a watch, to be sure, especially for the incredible performances. Everybody knocked it out of the park, but Delroy Lindo did an exceptionally good job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, it wasn't Spike Lee's best, and I for some reason I felt like he didn't do enough to explore the experiences of black soldiers and marines in Vietnam. Maybe more focus on making the flashback sequences more realistic and less cheesy and action-oriented would've helped with that. Still, the acting elevated the movie and basically saved it for me.", "Not my favorite Spike film but I enjoyed it for the most part. Delroy Lindo was excellent and the scene near the end with him talking to the camera as he moves through the jungle was heartbreaking. Especially the scene with him and Boseman\u2019s character.

Seriously, Eoin Colfer must have ran over one of the producers' dogs or something to deserve this intentional dissection of his work, or there is some decades-long blood feud at play or something to justify this atrocity.\n\nEverything is the opposite of what it should be. Artemis, a character who in the books can't even climb a ladder without getting winded, is seen surfing as a pastime in one of the opening scenes of the movie. He is earnest and heroic instead of conniving and callous. He ends up involved in the plot not because of a devious plan to get rich, but because he has to save his dad who is inextricably involved with the fairy underworld. He has a buddy cop camaraderie with Holly who is supposed to be his prisoner.\n\nSpeaking of Holly, the pioneer of women's achievement in the Lower Elements Police is instead a renegade cop who fights because of her father - they literally could not have picked a lazier or more insulting plot device. The nonhumans are pitted against Artemis not because of an adversarial hostage situation but because literally the future of their civilization is at stake due to some poorly-explained apocalyptic macguffin. The existence of nonhumans and magic is revealed to the world on camera when in the books they have a Wakandan-level of secrecy and effort to maintain the masquerade.\n\nArtemis's dad is a plot-critical hero instead of a minor character and career criminal. Butler is only ever referred to by his first name, which is such a closely-kept secret that in the books its very reveal was a critical plot point. Root is a woman. They even brought in Juliet and Opal Koboi in this trash to ruin those characters too when they don't even appear in the first book! The only thing missing was a scene where we are shown Artemis's mother, healthy and completely sane, running out of the mansion and persuading the LEPRecon to not fire the bio bomb. One or two of these alone may have just been a coincidence or executive decision for marketing purposes, but all of these together? You literally would have needed to hire a writer to read the books and intentionally come up with the worst possible story to go the opposite way of all of its themes and character arcs to come up with something like this. No way this was not by design.\n\nIt's too bad this movie is a colossal failure (as it should be) because I was impressed at the intelligent effort to undermine the books and would be interested in what a sequel would look like. Probably Artemis teams up with Cudgeon who is now a reformed good guy to track down Opal. They discover Opal is in league with Jon Spiro who has made a fairy technology-enhanced superweapon the C Cube of his own design. The heroes (which is the team of Artemis, his dad, the two Butlers, Holly, Foaly, and Mulch) hunt down the bad guys but then in the climactic showdown Juliet is revealed to be a traitor working for Spiro and kills Butler. Artemis is thrown in troll town and escapes with the help of Mulch and a gang of kindhearted goblins while Holly is captured. Artemis, without the help of the fairy technology, breaks into the bad guys' base Iron Man 3 style and rescues Holly and the good guys win.

I don't mean she dies in the movie, I mean they euphemistically explain at the very beginning that she was dead and had been for some time. I know she's a minor character but she was significant to the story and Artemis so removing completely shows a blatant disregard for the book.\n\nArtemis's father: He's some kind of protector of fairies which is the family legacy. He's not a criminal mastermind or anything. Also, he's not missing and is still around at the beginning. He gets kidnapped by Opal Koboi because **she's in this movie too for some reason.**\n\nJuliet: She had a minor role in the first book, yet they somehow manage to mess her up too. First of all, they made her Butler's niece. Not his sister, his freaking niece. Second of all, they made her 12. The reason for this is unclear, I think they wanted her to be an agemate/playmate with Artemis. \n\nButler: They call him by first name throughout the **entire film.** They even say when they introduce \"never call him the butler or he'll snap you in half.\" They also really weaken his character. He's a terrible bodyguard, constantly putting Artemis in danger, and he's not nearly as tough as he was in the book. They confiscate a weapon/gun from Holly when she's kidnapped and Artemis is interested in it. Not Butler, Artemis. Later when they are attacked by LEPrecon officers Butler needs Artemis's help to fend them off. Also they cut the scene where Butler fights the troll for no good reason. \n\nCommander Root: Root is a woman for some reason, which completely wrecks Holly's arc and their dynamic (don't worry they give Holly a different arc and it's hot, flaming garbage.) She's soft spoken and says \"top of the morning to ya.\" The only thing Root in the movie has in common with Root in the book is their name. \n\nMulch: They made him a giant dwarf. Dwarfus Giganticus or something, I don't know and I don't care. Because apparently what this movie really needed was Hagrid, am I right? They say that all dwarves are master thieves and Mulch is an expert at tunneling cause he's big. So they take everything interesting or unique about Mulch and make it a race or physiological characteristic. Mulch unhiniging his jaw was nightmare fuel. I know that's something that would be awkward to film, but there has to be a way to do it well. This wasn't it. \n\nHolly: My poor girl Holly, how they wronged you. She's clumsy, barely more than a screaming damsel in distress, and she has a blatant disregard for the rules. Her whole character arc is about how she's trying to clear her father's name, who everyone believes was a traitor. I'm not sure if this is a case of Disney couldn't fathom a character not having a tragic backstory involving their parents, or they couldn't fathom a woman joining the military if she didn't have a personal reason (involving a male family member of course). Artemis takes off his mirrored glasses multiple times and Holly doesn't mesmerize him. Also she doesn't escape, he lets her out and they are immediately allies. At one point they shake hands and say \"Friends forever.\" I cringed so hard. \n\nArtemis: He's not a criminal mastermind,  and in many ways he acts like a normal 12 year old boy. He's even very upset at the merest suggestion that his father might be a criminal. He's a very acrobatic kid, and he's surfing when he's introduced. You wanna know the worst scene in this whole movie (in my opinion)? Artemis does some daredevil acrobatics tricks to fend off hoards of attacking LEPrecon officers. He steals a gun from one, and despite never having seen such a weapon before in his life, immediately shoots with enough marksmanship to knock down several trained officers in flight. For the most part Artemis seems like a sweet but too-smart-for-his-own-good kid. \n\nThis movie was an absolute mess and the plot didn't make any sense. They threw out the book's plot, awkwardly smashed books 1 and 2 together, and added in a terribly explained plot about a macguffin that could end the world or something. Because we all know a movie's stakes mean nothing unless the fate of the world is at stake. \n\nCats was a better movie than this.", "Aggressively awful. It\u2019s almost like they wanted to torture fans of the books? None of the narrative choices made any sense. And the Kid playing Artemis was so wooden. The Dialogue was cringy af.", "It seems like it was massacred in the editing room. A real shame", "This is a bad film. Who is it for? You have to know at this point people will hate the drastic changes. And it actually looks well made. They just stripped it of everything that made it special. \n\nIt's an Artemis Fowl movie for people who hated Artemis Fowl?", "Does anyone know how much of this was changed in the edit? It seems like they refused to show Artemis' face anytime he spoke, would this because it was all done in ADR? \n\nAlso, the whole story being framed by Olaf in prison really seems like a last minute way to make sure Artemis has as little speaking as possible", "Artemis is such a Passive character in this movie, almost nothing he does is his own dping, but is instead out of plot necessity or because someone else told him to do it. He's described as a genius but we don't see this in action in any way. \n\nThe plot also feels very cobbled together, like 3 different people all wrote a script for it independently, they filmed all 3, then told 1 poor editor to make all 3 visions work. And everything from the book (mulch, the troll, the time stop) all felt like they were thrown in at once 3/4 of the way in and just mashed together. \n\nThe casting was not all terrible, although some choices were. I actually liked Gadd well enough but again it felt like he was written by 2 different people who never interacted. In the black and white sequences he's grim and broody and foreboding and then the rest of the time he was jokey and a smartass. Holly was young for her character (actress is 17) and she didn't have a lot to do so I can't really speak to most of her character. Butler casting was fine but a foot short. Juliet had no reason to be 12, and her youth made her a less dynamic character. Root I'm very mad about as making him Judy Dench completely negates Holly's arc from the book and probably why they threw in the Holly's Dad plot that felt useless. Artemis felt fine, although he didn't always act great, I feel he could have done good with a decent script and direction. \n\nBig plot and character changes that alters the plot negatively and made me mad: time stop mechanics changed. Everything with Artemis' dad leading him to magic instead of Artemis finding it himself, how quickly Artemis and Holly trust each other for no reason, Artemis' mom being dead and his dad being around, Holly's magic and magic in general being completely rewritten, Artemis' villainy and scheming, and the entire concept and structure of the seige (I thought they were gonna combine books 1 and 2 with how fast they did all of the siege), and Holly's entire character and motivation. \n\nOther deviations from the book that weren't vital to keep but that angered me: \"don't call him Butler, call him Dom\", the troll design was wayy off - especially with no tusks, the whole last fight was a disappointment, Artemis is athletic???, no bio bomb plot, Artemis doesn't think his dad is a criminal, and so many more things I can't remember because even though I watched the movie an hour ago, it's just so forgettable and bland.\n\nThe core premise of the book is it features an anti-hero/villain criminal mastermind 12-year old. But the movie features a boy who is no criminal, and not demonstrably a mastermind. The plot premise is a seige, but the seige feels like an afterthought. Every decision feels like it's trying to distance itself from the source material, and it's not even interesting on its own merits. \n\nI just don't think how Hollywood thinks that completely altering an adaptation is ever a good idea when wvery poorly done adaptation is a critical and financial bomb (TLA, Lightning Thief, WWZ, Eragon, etc.) And almost every adaptation that respects and adores its source material does well, even if they're not perfect 1:1 adaptations (LotR, Harry Potter, Hunger Games, GoT, and even the Twilight series did great financially if not critically)", "Artemis Fowl: a book series with a great central inversion, in that the child protagonist starts off as a cold-hearted sociopath with a criminal empire and Agent 47 as a manservant\n\nDisney's Artemis Fowl: just make him a normal 12-year-old lol, here's a hoverboard and some jeans", "Why is Artemis this cool physical athletic guy who surfs and rides about on a wheel thing? In the books I got the impression he was for the most part a bit of a neckbeard who has Butler do everything for him, highlighted I believe in book 3 when he literally can't make a sandwich.     \n    \n      \nThey've taken all flaws and sort of made him this wonderguy, it's ruined him before it's even really started. The script is absolutely predictable, as soon as the chair got mentioned I knew what was about to be said about it, I'm happy for those sorts of things to happen but talk about telegraphing the script, it's a kids film but don't treat children like morons, they aren't stupid. Less than 10 minutes in this is so bad. They've used character names without the actual characters is how I'd sum it up.    \n     \n      \nThis is completely incoherent.   \n     \n     \nAlright Butler is being stealthy by literally wearing his tuxedo in a forest with a ghillie suit rug half over him, this is now hilarious.", "It really just felt like a bad parody of something decent, and thats all I can say about it.\n\nEdit: it was also just an insane slog. For being an hour and a half long, it felt like 3 hours just because it was so boring. I wanted to quit 3+ times in the middle of it.", "Laurence Kinlan was cast as Beachwood Short, Holly's father, and shot scenes as him, but, quite predictably, they were all cut.  [https://twitter.com/laurencekinlan/status/1271911529278066689](https://twitter.com/laurencekinlan/status/1271911529278066689)\n\nHow else were they going to fit all the fan service scenes of... Artemis doing sports? Not to mention the stunning scene where Butler physically drags Artemis away from a TV with bad news on it like it's a nuke about to go off? He could have just quietly turned off the TV, but no, the shot of ARTEMIS DROPPING MILK had really driven home how the presence of a TV was DESTROYING Artemis.", "So I've not read the books but even without that I can see that this film was a total fail - it's clearly been hacked together in the editing room with swaths of exposition and ADR being thrown in to make it semi-cohesive. None of the characters are interesting and a lot of the performances are terrible; shout out to Josh Gad's Batman impression fail and Judi Dench's cross between Mrs. Brown and Sean Dyche. So a fail all round even without the book, though I don't doubt it's a horrid adaptation. \n\nOh, and Disney+ recommended A Wrinkle in Time as a \"Since You Watched This\" film. Says it all really.", "Is there an Artemis Fowl version of /r/LakeLaogai I can be sent to remove all knowledge of this movies existence?", "What goes on in these directors heads \n\n\u201cok so we\u2019ve got a best selling book read by 25 million people and a huge fan base, So instead of following the same plot let\u2019s Change it completely with a mash up of the first 2 books but explain almost none of the major plot points like why holly was at the tree in the beginning and the ritual she had to preform, you know how fairys have a finite amount of magic and when its gone they cant do shit yeh that\u2019s really important to the first book ok lets leave that all out. Also make sure the fairys at no point go invisible, ok but we Better throw in some special affects, subpar acting, random gender changes, bad dialogue, directing and editing and almost no effort to try and put a comprehendible story plot together and hope the viewers won\u2019t mind if we desecrate everything the story had to offer. Yeh that all sounds great, sounds similar to what they did to avatar the last airbender and that was a huge success.\u201d\n\nArtemis fowl Was probably one of my favourite book series to read as a child beaten only by Harry Potter. But wow after watching it I am furious at what Disney has done to this franchise. How could they ruin it that badly all they had to do was to follow the book! Literally.  \n  The plot was totally different as in the book it was all about a gold heist To restore the criminal family fortune and cure Artemis\u2019s gravely Ill mother. Whereas the film was about ransoming holly short to the fairies for a magical artefact (that he already had) so he could save his kidnapped father From a vague bad guy with a green torch and very slow moving magic.\n\nArtemis was supposed to be criminal!!! A socially awkward, cold, cynical, Ruthless, evil genius dick you were all rooting for but instead looked like he just walked out of spy kids who surfs and uses a hover board. has the highest IQ in Europe according to the books however in the film he can seem to spot a fake chair but fail to realise his father has a secret basement full of magical items. By far the cringeist line in the film was Artemis -  \u201call I want is to believe in you dad\u201d Seemed like he was beyond devastated being dragged away kicking and screaming NO. when he thought his father was a criminal and had committed a crime!!! (gasp, the horror) but then claimed he was himself a criminal mastermind in the ending. Good thing he only uses his mastermind power on fairies or us humans would really be in trouble. He\u2019d be spotting fake antiques all over the place. I can\u2019t imagine living in such a world\n\nArtemis\u2019s father who is presumed dead in the first book is very much alive and .....the protector of fairies??? seems to be more the mastermind of the story who has been leaving Artemis clues all his life about how to fight fairies only for them all to make sense when he finds out their true existence. Feel like he could have saved a lot of f-ing time if he just left him a clue on where he hid his safe key.  \n \n\nButler was an absolute mess. Supposed to be a terrifying mountain of a man, third most skilled martial artist in the world, large connections to the criminal underworld and of I think Russian origin (also was definatly white) instead he was a terrible bodyguard and seemed more a cuddly mentor who ended up crying. twice! The only thing he was going to snap was his way into another box of Twinkie\u2019s. Although I have no objection to him being cast as a black man I don\u2019t think this was the right choice. A black man as the \u201cloyal man servant\u201d of the fowls, a rich white family? hmmm\n\nJuliet..... seriously what the f was that. Was she supposed to be a play date for Artemis? maybe  they could have scrapped her meaningless 30 seconds of screen time to explain how 3 90lb kids pulled Butler out from underneath that 2 tonne troll and upstairs with no magic.\n\nOpal Kaboi is supposed to be Atemisis\u2019s version of Moriarty, a deranged, paranoid, genius pixi bent on world domination but is another character who fails to live up to their reputation and is nothing more than a slight nuisance with text book evil mastermind lines \u201cyoull never stop me\u201d. Her magic death crystal spell thingy moved slower than an asthmatic ant with heavy shopping. If she ever did meet Artemis surely he could just roll away on his lame hoverboard thing or shoot her. Would have been a more thrilling ending than how this film ended. \n\nRoot is supposed to be one old school angry mo fo fairy captain \u201cred as a beetroot\u201d who doesn\u2019t take shit from anyone. If he was half as angry as I was watching this film it would have been an improvement. Also why IS HE A SHE IN THE MOVIE. This totally takes away hollys characters motivation. And don\u2019t get me started on that \u201ctop of the morning to you\u201d scene. He was supposed to give holly short a tough time for being a female fairy but then realises she\u2019s alright and does a good job in the next 2 films emphasizing her strong female lead.\n\n Holly who was originally \u201cnut brown skin\u201d probably had the worst character assassination, this could have been a great opportunity for Disney to have a strong ethnic female lead but instead was portrayed as a clumsy girl who looked like she was younger than artemis. She was supposed to be in a male dominated task force showing everyone how a female agent can do her job just as good or better than the male agents which over the course of the books developed in to a stronger role. They rushed her and artemis\u2019s story and she decides to become his allies after about 2 sentences of dialogue and then got stuck in a chandelier throughout the whole of the best fight scene which was still shit. still she managed to have the second most cringy line when she said \u201cfriends forever\u201d during the ending. At least they didn\u2019t make you a boy.\n\nThere are not enough swear words to describe this excuse of a film, by far the worst film adaption of a book i have ever seen.

No, this is a shocking adaptation that not only butchers the source material but fails to substitute anything approaching charm or competence. This is far, far worse than detractors had imagined.\n\nThere is just so much fundamentally wrong with this movie. And there's stuff that's shit gravy like >!killing off his mother which completely changes his motivations as a character and the general arc of the narrative.!< Just... something went so terribly wrong during production.

There are many ways to ruin a movie, and many others to ruin one with solid source material.  But this?

Nah fam, we're doing the first 45 minutes like the Cats movie, where everything that happens does so only to introduce characters.  Casting? We've got money, so lets get some top tier talent.

The Artemis Fowl books, with this kind of money and acting talent behind them (not the casting talent though) should have been able to become a fairly solid series of movies.  Disney knew they had 2,3 maybe more movies in the bad with this, so why on earth did they not play it safe and *just adapt the fucking first book into a movie*.

Butler's real name is given away immediately despite it not being told to the reader until book 3 and it was definitely not common knowledge. The actor who played Butler did a terrible job and overall the acting was pretty shit across the board. Judi Dench's performance was bizarre. I found it very off-putting the way she barely moves.

We\u2019re now breaking it to our youngest sister, who\u2019s 11 and a huge Arty fan, just how bad it is. \n\nWorst parts:\n\nFoaly is a nerd with a tinfoil hat, not a jacket-wearing smoothie who wouldn\u2019t look out of place at London Fashion Week.

Just no. \n\nWhy is Mulch narrating? What\u2019s the motivation for his character to reveal this info to human security services? Just what? \n\nChanging Root\u2019s gender and character. I\u2019ve been mad about this since the trailers. Root was one of my favourite characters in the books, I actually cried when he died and the almost father/daughter dynamic to his relationship with Holly was completely undercut by changing his gender for no reason.\n\n Holly\u2019s struggle against institutional sexism is a huge part of the books. Having her be just another female LEPrecon officer undercuts that completely. Also, she\u2019s brown-skinned and eighty years old! Why is she played by a white child? Would it be so hard to scale double an adult actress down? \n\nWhere were Grub and Trouble? The taking out of the LEPrecon squad was so funny in the books. Here it\u2019s just a CGI slugfest.\n\nArtemis. He does not fight. He does not lose his cool. He does not wear PJs around the house. He is obsessed with gold.

Arty does not have a close, loving relationship with his father to start with. His mother\u2019s mental illness is also a huge part of his motivation in the first book, she\u2019s not dead. \n\nOpal is not in the first book. She\u2019s also not some robot-voiced Dementor wannabe, she\u2019s a femme fatale whose genius is matched by her vanity. She\u2019s a deliciously evil, fun, love to hate villain, not some two-bit first level video game boss. \n\nHow did they copy almost word for word some scenes from the book (Dr. Po\u2019s chair, Mulch in prison) and get the essence of the characters and the story so, so wrong? \n\nPlease, Disney, I\u2019m begging you.

I collected a ton of the Scooby-Doo VHS films, owned a bunch of the toys, was part of the Scooby-Doo book club, and watched several cartoon series (classic 70s, Pup Named Scooby-Doo, What's New?, Mystery Incorporated, New Scooby-Doo Movies). You get the idea.\n\nI went into this knowing what to expect from the trailers.\n\n**What I liked**\n\n* Some jokes landed for me where it legit made me laugh.\n   * Dick. ([clip from movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca-rG2RL3qQ))\n   * \"Let's throw the F-bomb!\"\n   * Multiple masks. Reminded me of the Johnny Bravo crossover.\n   * Dick Dastardly lying in his flashback.\n   * Scooby-Doo being the food thief that he is.\n   * Other jokes were fine as is, since humor is subjective.\n* Some of the animations were nice, as it tried to blend the 2D snapping style with 3D.\n* The stunt casting performances were fine, I guess? Since I grew up hearing Casey Kasem's voice and later Matthew Lillard's wonderful recreation, listening to Will Forte sounded super off. Everyone else is fine though.\n   * Ken Jeong as the straight-man (or straight-robodog?) is perfect casting.\n   * Always had some issue with stunt casting since it is for dummies who think an animated film has higher prestige if it has recognizable Hollywood actors.\n* The plot was fine, though I wish there was more mystery than just solving the villain's plan within the middle of the film.\n\n**What I noticed/neutral**\n\n* [Shaggy's first voice actor, Casey Kasem, was a devout vegetarian and animal rights activist; going so far to quit voicing the character when asked to do a Burger King commercial. He later came back under the deal of making Shaggy a vegetarian.](https://archive.is/20140618020758/http://www.citywatchla.com/8br-hidden/7059-casey-kasem-s-secret-legacy-how-he-used-scooby-doo-to-advance-his-values) When other actors took over the role, Shaggy retained his vegetarianism.\n   * I say this cause the first five minutes of the film, Shaggy walks out of a fast food joint called \"Casey's Creations\" that serves turkey drumsticks, pizza, and hot dogs. Later, Shaggy[ offers Scooby-Doo a non-meat sandwich, but then Scoob was like, \"Eat this lamb gyro I rolled across the ground!\"](https://youtu.be/pYas80wjCYw?t=212)\n   * Do the film's writers have some grudge against Casey Kasem?\n      * As a disclaimer, I love eating meat, but I think it's nice to have some form of representation for vegans. Even if that representation is a stoner.\n* Some scenes were cut from the final product (not deleted scene, but I guess more so for promos?).\n   * Shaggy and Scoob in the movie theater (and later at home when the movie was shifting into digital release). Well, that's expected since it is for an ad.\n   * Shaggy licking Scooby-Doo. I thought it was hilarious in the trailer. Wish they kept it in.\n\n**What I disliked**\n\n* Everything moved at breakneck speed.\n   * First 10-20 minutes had Shaggy and Scoob become friends, then they set up Mystery Inc. with the rest, and THEN they had a falling out thanks to Simon Cowell.\n* The introduction of Mystery Inc.'s first mystery was less mystery and more \"Beat the crap out of the homeowner who is dressed up like a ghost. Don't worry, he suddenly happens to be a thief too!\"\n   * It's not like the gazillions of Scooby-Doo episodes where each case is slowly introduced and [have a mystery where the audience can make a fun guess about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuorsbghT5M).\n* The contention reason for Shaggy and Scooby-Doo \"splitting\" up from Fred, Velma, and Daphne due to Simon Cowell was awkward and didn't provide some sense of build-up. Also, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo got upset from what Simon Cowell said even though the gang were defending them.\n   * Simon Cowell does make a sensible point on Shaggy and Scooby-Doo's unknown role in the gang though. (other than being bait lolololol)\n   * Why do they need to open up a themed restaurant in Venice Beach? It's a bit flimsy/reuse scenery. Would prefer a reality TV show like what they did in Zombie Island.\n* Fred, Velma, and Daphne have insanely less screen time. They're the glue that holds Mystery Inc. together. Much like other Scooby-Doo shows/movies where it doesn't have those three, it feels lifeless.\n   * The main crux of Mystery Inc. is the chemistry and characterization everyone has and how they approach a problem.\n   * First had a problem with their absence when I was a kid watching Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers. Just keep the Mystery Inc. gang together.\n* Simon Cowell in general. He looked really off/too realistic compared to the rest of the cartoony cast.\n   * Plus, him being there to make fun of himself is really overdone (see: Scary Movie 3, The Simpsons, Pop Star: Never Stop Never Stopping, Family Guy). Kids won't notice it. Not sure if Simon Cowell is recognizable to kids either.\n* Feels closer to a Blue Falcon + Dynomutt movie than a Scooby-Doo movie.\n   * Blue Falcon/Brian's uncertainty about his heroism throughout the film was way more relatable/better written than the sudden falling out of Mystery Inc., and Shaggy and Scooby.\n   * The 70s Dynomutt cartoon show had several Scooby-Doo crossover episodes dedicated to solving a mystery. Even **most** other Scooby-Doo crossovers with other shows/brands were solely focused on mystery solving (including twists).\n   * Mystery Inc. can easily be written out, with Scooby-Doo's distant relative role being swapped with Dynomutt.\n   * I choose to believe WB had a Blue Falcon script to revitalize the character (and was written due to the rise of superhero movies), but an exec wanted Scooby-Doo (fresher brand), so the writers flimsily rewrote the script to include a bunch of random Scooby-Doo stuff.\n   * Much like the crapton of Scooby-Doo straight-to-DVD releases, we got another straight-to-DVD quality supposed-to-be-for-theaters film, except the latter is worse in comparison.\n* Some of the graphic quality looked really poor, like if the film was made 5-7 years ago.\n* How did Dick know Scooby-Doo's ancestry?\n* The recreation of the classic Scooby-Doo intro just made everything look lifeless.\n   * Wasn't a fan of the cover song either.\n* Some of the Scooby-Doo fanservice felt jarring or just there as a \"remember this thing?\"\n   * The chariot chase. (no timely chase music?)\n   * Recreating the classic 70s intro.\n   * The unmasking. (felt unneeded)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is a movie made by and for people who absorbed the very rough basics of Scooby-Doo through pop-culture osmosis.\n\nWarner Bros. once again made the mistake of trying to go \"all in\" with establishing a larger universe by having a team-up movie without any build-up. If this is someone's first experience to Scooby-Doo, they'll think that the entire series is less mystery and more world ending mayhem.\n\nIn some ways, the movie felt like the third installment in the Hannah-Barbera universe, with a proper Scooby-Doo film being first and Blue Falcon being second.\n\nSeeing a big-budget animated Scooby-Doo movie was the dream, but the reveal trailer tanked my expectations. Even if this has the cartoon voice actors, I don't think their performances will save the mess that is Scoob!.\n\n[Oh, and looks like Jeffrey Epstein was supposed to cameo in this???

When they literally said \"friendship saves the day\" early on I thought that they might subvert that trope but no... They just did it. Dick Dastardly and Muttley are by far the highlights for me, also I loved the Hex Girls and Hong Kong Phooey references in the arcade. Captain Caveman felt crammed in there for no real reason.

That being said, the plot felt lazy. The Dynomutt characters were *okay* but I felt like they were way too prominent for their introduction movie. I also *really* didn't like Will Forte as Shaggy. I personally would've liked to see Matthew Lillard back but it is what it is. The modern age setting also threw me for a loop a bit as did Simon Cowell's guest appearance. \n\nUltimately, kids will probably eat it up as it'll resonate with current pop culture. Anyone who enjoys dumb humor that Scooby-Doo has always provided will get a few chuckles here and there but adults will most likely be bored with the plot.

If it'd just been a fun love letter to Hanna Barbera cartoons, they would've had a way less forced storyline and some solid humor for kids and adults. Honestly massively wasted potential. Everyone I've spoken to about it agreed they loved the cameos and the recreated intro, but that's literally it. Very young children enjoyed it from what I've seen, but even my 7 year old, who loves the original Scooby-Doo, Jabber Jaw, and Jhonny Quest thought this was weird except for the basic slapstick. He started playing with his Lego halfway through and only came back for Mystery Island because they showed Pterodactyls. He also loved the credits but kept asking where Jabberjaw was in the movie.", "I feel like whoever wrote this didn\u2019t understand what made the series fun or charming or just straight up didn\u2019t care. \n\nThat\u2019s the worst thing for me, personally. The animation is lively and the voice acting is a bit hit and miss - I kinda like Zac Efron as Fred and Amanda Seyfried as Daphne, though I wish she leaned a bit more into her Mean Girls prep a tad. Jason Isaacs was fun too. And Will Forte did, well, his best. It *sounds* off sometimes but hey at least he\u2019s adding his twist to things. I\u2019ve heard worse. \n\nBut yeah, the writing is what bums me out. Simon Cowell kicking the plot off (wut?), the larger HB universe feel, that one tinder joke - it just feels *off*. It\u2019s not like there hasn\u2019t been bad Scooby movies, this just feels like it went down the wrong path. Once you get past the fact it\u2019s not going to be a standard mystery in a comedy horror setting, there are some laughs here or there.", "This show should be re-created as them being kids. My 4 and 2 year old were sucked in during these parts. They watched afterwards but a few parts didnt keep their attention all the way(which theyre 4 and 2 its understandable). Heres hoping that they decide to at least to take the series somewhere moving forward and everyone not have to wait another 5 years to something dealing with Scooby and Shaggy.\n\n\nFrom my perspective I enjoyed this movie in both a fresh take on the original and for the nostalgic nods. It's unfortunate that Will Forte is in a position where the shoes he has to fill is almost impossible, that being said I think he did a wonderful job. I will say however that some of the dialogue choices for Shaggy through me off. There were many opportunities to add \"like\" where it would have felt natural, an example being \"oh man, like were out of calamari\" but thats just a nit pick.\n\n\nAt the end of the day this movie is great for kids and for parents that were a fan of the series or really even people new to Scooby. It's not the best movie in the world but it's definitely worth seeing to get your own opinion.", "When they played Outkast it mustve been a reference to them doing an original song for the first one", "The opening origin scene was cool and reminiscent of \u201cA Pup Named Scooby Doo\u201d.  I love how it then went into the classic sequence of them running like in the original Scooby Doo.  After the bowling alley scene, that\u2019s when Blue Falcon, Dynomutt and Dee Dee Sykes (one of the Teen Angels) were introduced and it moved into two different directions.  One where Scooby and Shaggy were coming to terms with moving on with a new opportunity with Blue Falcon while trying to stop Dick Dastardly (the Superhero story) and one where Fred, Velma and Daphne were connecting the dots to look for Scooby and Shaggy (the mystery story).  The Falcon Fury and the entirety of Mystery Inc. connect when they find the third Cerberus skull which is being held by Captain Caveman and his cave people. Scooby is taken by Dastardly along with the skull.  The rest of the movie is a straight up save Scooby and the world plot.  It leads to a fairly emotional ending.  I would say that a lot of the movie has to do with the power of friendship, growing with old friends, finding lost friends, and connecting with new friends.  \nI\u2019ll just say one other thing, my 7 year old daughter told me about 30 minutes into the movie that it seemed like a completely different movie. So I can definitely see where people are coming from when they say the movie is disjointed.  I feel that Scoob could have taken a bit from the MCU in using this movie to set up the Scooby gang in an adventure while possibly keeping Dastardly as the villain and then at the very end connecting them to another member of the universe.  Maybe Blue Falcon and Dynomutt bringing them on board the Falcon Fury to talk about building some kind of super team.  \nOverall, it was a movie that the kids and I enjoyed watching and I\u2019d recommend it to families and Hanna-Barbera fans that enjoy seeing these characters from their childhood that don\u2019t mind updates that come with the times.", "I actually enjoyed this movie and thought it was solid. I'd give it a 7/10. I will say that there are valid complaints about this movie. Will Forte sounded off and Marky Mark sounded like Ryan Reynolds. Other valid complaint is that this movie wasn't a traditional Scooby-Doo movie. Meaning one that had a mystery to solve surrounding a monster. Despite that, I am completely fine with that. There's enough Scooby-Doo reboots and Direct to Video movies we could pick from if that's what we wanted. I think this movie did a good job of doing something that some Cinematic Universes failed to do. That is setting up the universe while making a decent movie. Who better then to set up the Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe than Scooby-Doo?\n\n\n\nWith that said, hopefully the Scooby-Doo sequel does go back to form and involve an actual mystery. As for this being a Blue Falcon movie as some people described, I disagree with that. I think its more of a Scooby and Shaggy movie. Blue Falcon and Dynomutt did get to piggyback on their journey though and I am ok with that. I really enjoyed their dynamic and feel that they have room to grow. It was off putting at first but quickly I grew to love the idea of Blue Falcon being an incompetent newbie and Dynomutt the hardened veteran. I'll be seeing their movie in theaters if it comes out. Then again, I've always been a sucker for super heros. Blue Falcon and the rest of the Hanna-Barbera superheroes are included. Maybe we can get a Harvey Birdman Attorney at Law movie lol. \n\n\n\nI enjoyed the new characterizations of the rest Mystery Inc. gang. Unfortunately they didn't have a lot to do. Daphne was adorable and not bland, Velma is the true leader, and Fred could've been better tbh. I did love how they all missed Shaggy and Scooby when they were missing. I don't remember a lot of appreciation for those two from them. I'm sure there are a lot of examples that I am missing. The sequel will need to bring the focus back onto the whole gang in the future. I'm sure there is some back story they can explore. Velma seems to be Latina in this version. Hopefully Fred can be less dumb. Finally Captain Caveman, why the hell was Tracy Morgan Captain Caveman? I came to accept it as it went on at least, this was a weird movie all around anyway. With that said, I think fans of Hanna-Barbera cartoons and characters have something to look forward to. Scooby-Doo fans may be left wanting more or unsatisfied.\n\ntl;dr: This movie is more of a Hanna-Barbera movie than a Scooby-Doo movie. Overall it does a good job of setting up the universe and telling a decent story. The focus is more on Scooby and Shaggy with Blue Falcon and Dynomutt piggbacking it.", "It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s fine for a kid\u2019s film, but man oh man Will Forte is just not a good Shaggy, I barely hear shaggy, I only hear MacGruber kinda slightly changing his voice.\nThe pop culture references are pretty random and out of no where, Scooby himself is the highlight by far, all the celebrity voices (Tracy Morgan, Mark Whalberg, Ken Jeong) all very distracting and unnecessary but hey, big animated IP that was supposed to come to theaters, it makes sense", "This movie felt like it really wanted to be Into The Spider-Verse so badly, but they really should've just made a solo Scooby movie first. Then do the Hanna-Barbara crossover.\n\n\nPros:\n\n\nAs someone who occasionally watched Boomerang as a kid, I really enjoyed the references to older cartoons. However, I don't really know much about Blue Falcon tbh, but I really enjoyed his character in this movie. Probably my favorite character in the film, which isn't really a good thing to say about a Scooby Doo movie. Some jokes got a good laugh out of me. Dick Dastardly was a pretty good villain. The funhouse mirror scene actually did a good job at setting a spooky vibe. Really wish the movie had more of that.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nWill Forte was just horrible as Shaggy. Every time he spoke, I completely zoned out of the movie. And Scooby not speaking in R's and talking in complete sentences also made me zone out but not as much as Shaggy. At least Scooby was actually played by his original voice actor.\n\n\nSimon Cowell's appearance makes literally no sense.\n\n\nBlue Falcon dabbing. Ugh. Well, at least no one in this film did a fortnite dance.\n\n\nThe Walmart and Netflix product placement. Just, no. The fact they even used the Netflix scene in commercials advertising this movie just turned off my interest more and more whenever it popped up. I'm surprised they didn't just slap Google on Velma's computer instead of 'Lookyup'.\n\n\nCould've easily shortened the origin story tbh.\n\n\nScooby's actual name is Scoobert, not Scooby.\n\n\nWhat was the point of Dick disguising himself as a female cop when he could've just captured the van using the giant claw? I mean, it foreshadows he wears disguises for other moments in the film but here it really didn't make much sense.\n\n\nWas Simon Cowell always Dick Dastardly? If so, what was the point of separating the gang, capturing only Scooby and Shaggy, and then capture Velma, Fred, and Daphne? Why not just capture all of them at the same time? I guess they wanted to go with an epic plot twist that Simon was Dick, but it wasn't executed very well. Especially since it goes by quickly.\n\n\nSo Dick destroys Falcon's ship... and then gives the gang back the Mystery Machine in perfect and functioning condition? What? Like, how does Dick not put 2 and 2 together and realize they can (and did) just put the rockets on the Mystery Machine. Why didn't Dick just destroy the Mystery Machine as well? Why even give the Mystery Machine back to the gang at all?\n\n\nFred looking at the Mystery Machine slowly burning was nice, like seeing a loved one die in front of his eyes... and then immediately ruined by Fred 'avenging' his van and getting knocked out by the monster. :/\n\n\nFred's ascot gets like 5 seconds.\n\n\nI don't like how Fred is referred to as the 'tanker' of the group. Whenever I think of Fred, 'tanker' is not the word that pops into mind. 'Planner' should've been the word since Fred is very much associated with plans.\n\n\nDick's minions turned good for no real reason other than plot convenience. Yeah, Daphne helped one but was that seriously enough to get all of them to turn good?\n\n\nWhere was the mystery?\n\n\nHeh, that's cute. The movie thinks we're actually going to believe Shaggy is stuck in Hell.\n\n\nFor what's basically a superhero movie, I'm surprised there was no end credits scene teasing anything. Instead, we get drawings during the credits of other iconic Hanna-Barbara characters. Yay? I mean, I loved it, but I feel like an end credits scene of Blue Falcon introducing the new recruits with each other would've been more impactful imo.\n\n\nFred, who's known for being very attached to the Mystery Machine, gets over the 'death' of the original van very quickly.\n\n\nThe new Mystery Machine feels so unnecessarily high-tech.\n\n\nSeriously, why was Simon Cowell here?\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nNot the absolute best, but it wasn't the absolute worst either. I still enjoyed some moments of it and I think kids will still enjoy it as well. I assume they'll want to make a sequel so my suggestions are (1) focus more on Scooby, (2) provide an actual mystery, (3) get rid of every non-original voice actor especially Will Forte, and (4) don't shove in random irrelevant celebrities like Simon Cowell for no reason and make the movie feel outdated.\n\n\nMy score: 6/10. Like I said, not the absolute best, but it wasn't the absolute worst either. I still enjoyed some moments of it and I think kids will still enjoy it as well.", "God, this could have been so good. There were moments of it that I absolutely loved - any of the chase scene, the remake of the opening credits, the gag where Scooby kept eating the Scooby Snacks that were meant to distract the three-headed dog. Basically, anything that was a reference to the Scooby mythos worked perfectly. I even thought the voice acting, except for Will Forte, was fine.\n\nWhat didn't work was the ham-fisted effort to build a cinematic universe in the Scooby Doo movie. They crammed five Hanna-Barbera properties into this movie. The biggest shame is that this universe could have actually worked, if they gave it time to set up.\n\nI can't even imagine that kids like a lot of these jokes. Simon Cowell would have been a hilarious cameo in 2004. Here, it just felt like a bunch of boomers writing what they think kids still are interested in.\n\nIt's such a shame that we didn't get a Scooby Doo story in this movie. There wasn't even a mystery. They should have done a stand-alone Scooby Doo movie first. Old guy committing some weird real estate crime running around in a mask. Then they could have used Scooby characters in a Captain Falcon movie, and also combined Captain Caveman with the Flintstones in another movie. Then get them together.\n\nI hope they continue, because I think there's a lot about this that worked.

I don\u2019t think any kid who watches it would be able to tell me what Dick Dastardley\u2019s plot was.  \n  \nAs near as I can tell: He made a Stargate that opened a portal to the underworld.  He sent his dog through the portal to steal the underworld\u2019s gold.  But the portal only worked one way and his dog couldn\u2019t return.  So he plotted to kidnap Scooby Doo because Scooby Doo is the ancestor of Alexander the Great\u2019s dog and records proving that lineage somehow exist, which makes him able to traverse the portal both ways.    But he also needs three giant skulls to open it.  Or something.  \n  \nI was dozing off by the end so I probably missed some stuff, but that\u2019s what I got.  The villain in the beginning had a simpler, but even more nonsensical plan.  He was dressing up as a ghost to scare kids away from his house...because he had some stolen TVs in a closet?  How do those two things go together?  And why were Fred, Daphne, and Velma dressed up to trick or treat but Shaggy was the only one with candy?  They didn\u2019t even have bags.  And how did they know the TVs were hot? \n \nThe voice work was good.  I think the actors were having fun.  Including a lot of other Hanna Barbera characters was a fun choice, but way overdone.  But having the movie be this globetrotting sci-fi action adventure felt very off brand.  There wasn\u2019t even a mystery!  I\u2019m probably being too harsh.

Who knew?\n\n* The three mystical skulls Dastardly needs for his evil plan is a complete lift from the 1996 comic book movie *The Phantom*.\n\n* The bowling alley where Shaggy and Scooby are attacked is named Takamoto Bowl, after Scooby-Doo\u2019s original designer Iwao Takamoto.\n\n* The third skull is located below Messick Mountain, a nice nod to original Scooby-Doo voice actor Don Messick.\n\n* In the original *Dynomutt Show* it was Dynomutt the Wonder Dog who was the clumsy comic relief but in this incarnation, it\u2019s Blue Falcon\u2019s son who is the goofball.  Is this another case of subverting expectations?\n\n* We get plenty of references to other Hanna-Barbera animated properties such as Peebles Pet Store from *The Magilla Gorilla Show*, Dick Dastardly is obviously from *Wacky Races*, Velma\u2019s laptop was from Quest Labs, and posters for Hong Kong Phooey and the Hex Girls can be spotted in the Funland Amusement Park.  These are all pretty fun items for fans to find but there was one painful reference that set my teeth on edge, and that would be Captain Cavemen and the bizarre voice casting of Tracey Morgan.\n\n* It's clear that Mark Walhberg\u2019s Blue Falcon was trying hard to be Will Arnett\u2019s *Lego Batman* but they forgot to include the charm and humour.", "Does it get better after the first 15 minutes?

And the defence for Forte is that he\u2019s a bigger name but I\u2019d argue that is just barely the case, and he also probably carries a bigger price tag.

It even sounded like he just recorded lines at his house and emailed them to the studio. Literally not needed.", "Growing up as a huge fan of the original Scooby Doo cartoons, this was really disappointing. Pretty much the only good part to me was the opening theme song. I'm not sure why they decided to go with this direction. I don't mind a modern take, but we really didn't need the superhero trio who feels like they have more screen time than Daphne, Velma, and Fred. Since when has Scooby-Doo been focused around super heroes and advanced technology? Feels like they just threw together an awful plot, lacking characters and comedy, random Hannah Barbara characters, and ignored the actual core of Scooby-Doo where they solve a mystery.", "I liked it, lighthearted comedy that just was a way to pass time. I think they were really banking on this movie to be a summer hit for the kids, shame corona ruined it lol", "I am absolutely ***agog*** at how terrible this was. It seemed like it was written by someone who had never written a movie before. Or *seen* a movie. Or Scooby-Doo. The jokes fell flat every time, the actors were completely miscast, they completely fucked up the whole mystery-solving aspect that's pretty well paramount to the franchise, and I'm sorry, but *SIMON COWELL?* Was this written in 2003?", "I am a DIE HARD ride or die for Scooby since I was a kid and have watched every film and series.  I knew I would hate Shaggys new voice but it didn\u2019t bother me as much as I thought.  I knew I would hate how much Scooby talked and I did.  I loved the animation and coloring and even the character designs.  Wasn\u2019t really expecting a superhero movie but I just went with it as I\u2019ve seen everything at this point. I Would have liked more of the complete group working together and more of a classic mystery solving than the superhero aspect but I suppose it translates better having a bigger villain than before especially after 50 years of the same stuff it can be hard to keep it fresh.  Ultimately i found the main plot almost boring but not the worst Scooby film I\u2019ve ever seen and still had fun with.  My nephew loved it and I ultimately liked it.  So far I say 3/5 most of that being the animation style.", "I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I was really disappointed. They barely gave Fred Vilma and Daphne enough screentime and when they did it made them look like surface level characters compared to their older versions. I didn't mind the story plot even though it felt very forced from point B to point C while glossing over A. They mentioned needing Cerberus skulls but only got to see them attempt to get 1 while the villain already grabbed both of them offscreen.

Seems like the earlier version explains the blatant wtf deus ex machina of the ending better too.\n\nWatching it though, it wasn't really that bad, I liked it. I know it's not great nothing mindblowing but it was cute and probably good for kids and I laughed a few times. Took a bit to get over how scooby is now a scholar capable of complete sentences and thoughts but whatever, we can just write that off as easily as the officer did to the runaway in the beginning. Not once in this movie was anyone surprised his dog can talk.\n\nCerberus was awful though, all that buildup for a holographic theme park ride-tier monster that does nothing and probably wouldn't be much of a threat to the world if it were allowed to roam free.

Then I saw California in the website, and  I thought that was a bit odd but not too weird. But when the end scene said San Pedro, where I live, that through me for a loop.

I love scooby do and the gang. I rewatch old shows and movies just to hear the stories again. This was so dry and sad and irrelevant that I fell asleep half way through, and wasn't even invested when I tried a second time to watch it. Shaggy sounded off and depressing. Scooby felt out of place because he's almost always loyal, even when he's \"special\", and Daphne, Velma, and Fred weren't even really there. Any why the fuck was Simon Cowell there? It felt lazy, and I wish I hadn't spent money to see it at all.", "This movie has an incredibly outlandish plot but still feels as dull as dishwater.

Came in with no expectations. But I really want this one to succeed so there would be more Scooby Doo movies on the big screen. I was never really a fan of the other Hanna Barbera cartoons so I dont really know much about Blue Falcon, etc. I wouldve wanted if they just focused on the core group and have their smaller scale mystery, which this film didnt really have one. Also, Shaggy and Scooby were separated from the Mystery Inc. for the better part of the movie, which doesnt make sense imo.", "They really could have done something interesting with this movie. They have three different dudes with dogs. They could have delved into the 3 unique relationships and show why shaggy and scooby are have a better relationship.

The soundtrack was so tonally weird (Bombs Over Baghdad for an action flight scene? Wut lol). I wish they leaned into the cliches/references to the originally show instead of just resorting to making fun of American millennials at times, it felt too in the fence as far as what it wanted to be. I also don\u2019t give a single shit about the Blue Falcon, and it felt like the studio tried to make a BF movie and had to throw in the Scooby Doo franchise to sell it.\n\nI did like the animation generally though, and thought some jokes were pretty funny. I\u2019d give it a 4-5/10", "I'm renting this tomorrow, I've always loved Scooby Doo... but man do the trailers for this look awful.

We showed them some of the old cartoons to get them in the Scooby spirit and they loved them. This movie was such a disappointment. It honestly didn\u2019t hold their attention for more than 30 minutes. My husband and I still can\u2019t figure out what the movie was actually about. And it felt like everything but a Scooby Doo movie. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know why it is bothering me so much but I just don\u2019t remember Scooby talking as much as he did in this movie. I know he talked but I just felt like the amount he was talking ruined the character for me. \n\nJust an all around bummer and I can\u2019t believe we spent $25 on it. Honestly? If it had entertained the kids I could easily look past a lot of things but I don\u2019t imagine we will ever be watching it again.", "I really enjoyed this film. I thought it was chock full of easter eggs and I was more than happy with the antagonist. The funniest part is that they're keeping Fred's trap fetish as canon which gives his character added depth.", "I bought this this morning because my daughter has been on a scooby doo kick. We watched it twice this morning and she wants to watch it twice. I liked it. It was a kids movie, so low expectations. I thought it was more fun than Onward or Trolls. \n\nGrading this on the scale of the Scooby Doo movies I've had to watch this week with my daughter its a better one. A tight hour and a half of cool and colorful animation. \n\nY'all are really critical of splitting up a gang that uses the catchphrase of \"Alright gang, let's split up!\" \n\nI liked having the Hanna Barbera characters more than just another random typical Scooby Doo characters like real estate developers/witches/generic love interests/teenagers. \n\nThere were some good jokes in there and although it was a tad predictable I enjoyed it as a parent watching with the kid. Simon Cowell was weirdly out of place though.\n\nJason Isaacs was marvelous as Dick Dastardly. The villain had a touching story that managed to make him a much a more grounded and likeable character. He was goofy and sinister. This character and Isaacs' performance were definitely highlights.\n\nThe Hanna Barbera cinematic universe thing is real. Cinematic might not be true, but give these characters life in shows and direct to streaming movies. I want to see more of them in the future regardless of this film's performance. I think there were enough good cameos, easter eggs, and supporting roles from recognizable characters it could be pulled off. Here's a great idea for Warner Bros. to start, Tracey Morgan needs a Captain Caveman show on HBOMAX. They're trying to do a Jellystone series but some of these decades old cartoons are the perfect IP to milk content out of for a new streaming service. I yelped in the credits when the gang met Dr. Benton Quest. It would be a pleasant surprise to see some of these characters brought back or reimagined in the 2020s. Build that all up to a big Laff-A-Lympics to coincide with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.", "This is garbage. You made a Scooby-Doo movie with no mystery; Fred has no plans, and you\u2019d be better off leaving Velma out rather than whatever Gina Rodriguez did to the character. \n\nMy girlfriend and I both said this might have worked if it was just the Hanna-Barbera movie, like the LEGO movie but it stripped away almost everything that makes Scooby-Doo. If feels like they took someone who had never seen Scooby-Doo and gave them only two episodes to watch and then had them write this. \n\nI also agree with all the other major criticisms, the Simon Cowell thing makes me think this was a 2005 script that dusted off, this is another case of a studio trying to make their own MCU by starting with the Avengers, the animation was uneven.", "I watched up until Simon Cowell showed up for literally no reason then I paused and deleted my copy of it.\n\nI've heard a few reviews already so I have a vague idea of the rest of the movie, but this is Illumination level of lazy pop culture jokes. \n\nScooby Doo is a roller coaster of quality, but this is way way at the bottom.", "I didn\u2019t think Scoob! was very good sadly. Almost all of the jokes were lame and falling flat for me and it was stupid that Scooby-Doo and the gang were separated for almost the entire movie. Blue Falcon was kind of annoying, the pop-culture references were not executed well and I don\u2019t feel Dick Dastardly had much character and made the movie feel more like a Superhero film than a Scooby-Doo film I guess? Some nice Animation here and there and little references to the series, but overall pretty underwhelmed by this movie. 5/10", "I thought this movie was average and teeters on the bad side. But, there is a lot to like in Scoob, mainly in its Shaggy-Scooby relationship, the adorable dusting robot, and pleasant animation. It looks incredibly vibrant with a very appealing color palette and has extremely fluid animation. But underneath the surface, there's not much there to keep you engaged. As a result, the movie feels like a slob despite its short running time.\u00a0\n\nThe story is just not that engaging and never tries to make us care about its rip off of the \"mother-box\" plotline from Justice League, which coincidentally is another Warner Brother Film. We never understand the motivation behind Dick Dastardly trying to open the gates, until the very end. Due to that, there's no reason to care if the villain succeeds in his plan or if Scooby+Shaggy+Crew manages to ruin the Villain's plan. The whole dynamic of the hero vs villain is completely non-existent.\u00a0\n\nThe whole superhero aspect of this movie doesn't make much sense. In the start, they introduce us to Falcon Fury and his crew using action-figures. One could surmise that they are imaginary akin to Superman in an ordinary world, but suddenly he's real? and no one bats an eye? I'm not that familiar with the world of Scooby-Doo, but the way the movie presents its world makes the existence of superheroes not exactly plausible. Additionally, the movie makes numerous references to the fact that they haven't come across real ghosts (the real estate developer using a sound machine, for example), so the lack of surprise for the existence of ghosts doesn't feel right. The world-building is murky and not fleshed out enough to support the story at hand.\n\nScoob is not compelling enough to sustain interest, making for a disappointing watch.\n\nMore Reviews like this: https://letterboxd.com/Sam_An/", "3 year old loved it, so that's all that matters in the end, to me.", "Why did they decide to have Scooby speaking mostly normally despite using the same voice actor?

It was so bad and janky, it was jarring", "It's a fine film, but of course I would prefer less of a setup, and more of a traditional scooby doo movie.

I get some of the complains, a save the world adventure ain't exactly what the \"soul\" of scooby doo was but what the fuck it was always just about meddling kids solving some mystery. There's like hundreds of episodes from a dozen different reboots with that same spirit, a blockbuster movie being different plot wise really isn't the worst thing ever.\n\nOh no these pop culture references are RUINING my 50+ old cartoon series :(((. Listen man we get it you watched the 2012 mystery inc and thought it was the best thing ever but damn dude it ended let it go, everything you loved will eventually get replaced.

There was no emotional payoff to it and it didn\u2019t resonate with any of the themes that I felt like the movie had been developing. The tone of the soundtrack at the end bothered me, the final text bothered me, the way it cut to the title bothered me. Seriously the ending was so bad. Knocked it to a 4/10 from a 6/10 for me.\n\nIt\u2019s like, I am trying to get on the movie\u2019s wavelength and understand what it is saying and doing. I am following the arcs, recognizing repeating ideas, thinking it is pretty good. I felt like there was a really good movie in here about an evil man with dementia, on the one hand he is trapped inside of himself with his horrible memories of evil deeds and tragedies, too far gone to take solace in the people around him. And then everyone on the outside wanted to get into him, to reconnect, to find the gold, to get evidence of past crimes and take him down, but his dementia thwarts the efforts of those around him trying to get in. But I really can\u2019t see the son plot line contributing to this in any meaningful way or paying off these themes satisfyingly. I don\u2019t care about this kid at all because he\u2019s emphatically not a character in this movie, he has zero development, and Capone is too far gone to have any reaction to his arrival so... why is that the ending?\n\nI\u2019m elaborating my thoughts in hopes someone can maybe make me see it a different way. I much prefer to like movies, and I have no trouble accepting I may be missing the pieces that tie things together here. But for now, I just don\u2019t see it, and it felt like such a hollow ending that was reaching for some sort of totally unearned emotional moment.", "I'll cosign what everyone else is saying about the movie (not good) but I'll also have to go against the grain a bit and say I didn't like Hardy's performance either. I'm a big fan of his (I thought he did a great job in Legend, another weak gangster biopic, for example) but this was just such a cartoonish, unbelievable, irritating performance.\n\nI feel like this premise demanded something more subdued to make it work. A once powerful man reduced to a pathetic shell and trapped with the demons in his head is a powerful idea, but I didn't see a real person. I saw a caricature of a snarling lunatic. It's somewhat entertaining to watch, I guess, but it was a total barrier to getting genuinely invested in the character or the story. Look at Junior losing his mind in the final few seasons of the Sopranos, or Vito shambling around in the garden with his grandson in The Godfather, or Hector Salamanca in his wheelchair in Breaking Bad. You *can* make me believe or care about an aging, decaying gangster. They just failed to do so here.\n\nI had genuine trouble believing Linda Cardellini (an actress who radiates sweetness, imo) would find anything to love in this fucking mess of a person, for example. Like, even before his mind went he just came across as a sinister maniac. How could I possibly give a shit what happens to this guy or his family if I don't buy that he's a real person in the first place? That's a writing/conceptual problem first and foremost but Hardy should get some of the blame too. And the atrocious makeup didn't help.\n\nThat meme of Hardy's dialogue being hard to hear hit its peak here too. I have no idea if its true to Capone's real voice at this time or not but it was just such a silly, over-the-top growl.

No wonder it took long for this movie to get distribution and just in time to dump it on VOD during the coronavirus pandemic. The idea of making a movie about Capone\u2019s final year with his rotten brain in Florida is actually interesting but the movie is not. The movie is dull, boring, and pointless. The writing is dogshit. I have no idea what or why Matt Dillon\u2019s character exist, same as the secret son character, that pointless sex scene intro with Matt Dillon\u2019s character was a desperate attempt to add depth to his character somehow.

Absolutely garbage. For several years there were reports of Tom Hardy being attached to, and ultimately starring in an Al Capone movie. And this is what we got? What a waste.", "At one point Tom Hardy was attached to play Al Capone in a David Yates production and after seeing Josh Tranks *Capone* I dearly wish that film had come to pass instead of this one. Hardy gives a fantastic performance as a syphilitic Al Capone whose descent into madness marred his final year on Earth but watching him shit his diapers and mumble incoherently for much of the movie didn't really appeal to me. There may be an audience for this movie but it's nothing I can recommend.", "I couldn\u2019t understand Tom Hardy", "6/10.\n\nJust went into the movie without any knowledge on the plot. The story is ok-ish but boi oh boi how good is Tom Hardy.", "Honestly, this was one of the worse movies I've seen all year. I knew it would be rough going into it, but quite literally if I didn't spend 10 dollars to watch it. I would have stopped half way through.\n\nTom Hardy barely speaks the whole movie, it's grunts and moans, and him shitting himself for two hours. Literally shitting himself. I counted at least 3 times he shit himself during the move, and one time where he pissed himself.\n\nIf he does speak it's one word, in fact the most speaking he does is at the beginning when he's explaining what Thanksgiving is to him. Even that's incoherent.\n\nI wouldn't call the flashback scenes, flashbacks. By the end of the movie I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't but I guess that's part of the point. On top of that the \"flashbacks\" take up all of 5 to 10 mins of the movie. The rest is pretty much a haunted house flick based around his dementia and his son which I don't even know exists or if it's a metaphor for himself when he was younger.\n\nMatt Dillon's character is wasted.

But the subject is fascinating in Al \u201cFonz\u201d Capone, as they call him in most of the movie. Josh Trank, back from years in exile, wrote and directed this movie that should have made it to the big screen instead of my home theater set up, but times are what they are.\n\nTom Hardy and Linda Cardellini lead this movie in every way and both are fantastic as the mentally broken crime boss and his long set upon wife.\n\nThe movie is ostensively about the last year of Capone\u2019s life in Florida as syphilis rots his brain and dementia comes to dominate his life. The underlying plot of the movie is ten million that Capone may or may not have hidden and everyone wanting Capone to give up the location. This is just a plot device to propel the movie forward. If you sense I may not have loved the movie, well you would be half right, maybe a little more than that.\n\nSometimes how a movie is viewed can dictate the reaction to it. My home theater is decent with pretty good sound. Both of these features made me long for theaters again. The movie is richly filmed and the sound and music were brilliant and strong. Hardy mumbles his way through most of the movie, intentionally, and none of it was lost, his breathing, his confusion, his anger.\n\nCardellini is the other stand out here as Capone\u2019s wife Mae, left to deal with a man lost in his own mind as she is left to make sure he is taken care of everyday. You can feel he loyalty and love while also getting the sensation of all the horrible things he must have put her through over her life.\n\nTogether they make interesting viewing. It is the entire rest of the movie that fights to fill the time that lost me. \n\nCapone was a polarizing figure in his time, and there were so many angles Trank, who also wrote the screen play, could have gone. After watching the movie there were at least six different characters, not including the made up one, that pop in and out of the movie with paper thin development. They are so thin that who they all are isn\u2019t even clear, such as maybe a son no one knows about trying to reconnect with his Father. \n\nThe FBI shows up, looking like the G-Men of old, threatening and inept all at once. The lead agent give a good speech likening Capone to Hitler showing no rationale why he hates Capone so much. His own superior doesn\u2019t get it, and I didn\u2019t either. \n\nKyle MacLachlan plays Capones doctor who is on the hook for something to the FBI, but outside of a pair of scenes, that thread goes nowhere.\n\nAnd that is the way most of the plot threads go. Matt Dillon is introduced having sex out of focus as a phone rings. But the entire scene is an intentional red herring for a plot threat that goes nowhere, but attempts to tie into the missing money.\n\nAll of it is just frustrating. Plot threads that go nowhere. The characters that make little sense and exist just to make a scene work later on.  All of it then forgotten later. Dillon plays a character named Johnny Torrio, who meets a violent end in the movie just to demonstrate that Capone lived a violent life. The real Torrio was the man who brought Capone up and gave him his first job and retired to New York, giving his part of Chicago to Capone. More pointless rewriting of history.\n\nI suppose what I want to say is, I wanted to like this movie. I liked Chronicle, Trank\u2019s last good movie. Hardy and Cardellini are both great and interesting. But the overall story, all of the random plots that go nowhere or serve no purpose, It all distracts from a movie that could have been so much better. \n\n\u201cCapone\u201d rents for ten bucks right now on Amazon. If you have a good screen, impressive sound, ten buck, and two hours of frustration, then this is your movie.", "So is Trank still in director's jail?", "Meh. Not a bad movie. I rather liked it.", "It's bad, but it's certainly not generic. I'll give it a few points for that.", "This movie near instantly reminded me of 'The Irishmen' in that they show 'the end of the road' and not just the journey of a gangster.\n\nThis movie is almost exclusively 'the end of the road' and you quite literally watch Al Capone fall apart throughout the duration of the film.\n\nIt made some odd choices in the way it depicts a dying man, especially in the sound effects department.\n\nCapone's voice in this film is pretty unbearable. It's 2 hours of grunting and farting.\n\nI don't think I'll recommend this movie to anybody.", "It was okay. Hardy excelled but that is the norm with him, and Josh Trank legitimately tried to tell the story in an interesting manner, that of making the audience as disorientated, confused as Capone was in terms of understanding what was actually real or not. Doing so alas highlighted his lack of experience and I suppose ability to follow through convincingly. Reminded me of 'Mute', another movie recently that tried to tell a story through the main character's ailments but failed to make that ultimate connectivity to the audience. Best example of how to do it? 'Memento', a movie that went backwards so the audience can follow the story with the same eyes as Leonard Shelby (both character and audience are barely understanding what he is actually doing and has no idea what he just did).\n\nSo, okay, but scattered. A lovely twenty minute sequence of Capone walking through his own memories though. More of that would've clarified Trank's vision.", "This was just awful.

Instead, it tries to convey a mind struggling to hold on to a questionable reality or is becoming increasingly haunted by a past it can't quite grapple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it has Tom Hardy wielding a Tommy Gun in a diaper. What more can you ask for?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo major props  for making a  'gangster' film that few (the presumed target audience)  would want to watch in the first place.", "I genuinely enjoyed the film, I was never bored and Tom Hardy is...fucking insane. I could see how it could turn somebody off, but personally I love these roles like Tony Montana and this where the actor just goes all the way in with the weird fucking accent and it's just a treat to watch for me. Cardellini, Dillon, etc were all really good, the cast was great. I thought the movie was shot gorgeously, the way they observed the mansion really gave it mystique, like a mythical figure. I thought they did a great job humanizing him, with the first half of the movie in general. The aesthetics of the film were wonderful, Tom Hardy with a machine gun is great, and the pervasive imagery (the guy getting stabbed in the neck ->the steak or the crocodile) was really cool. I think really the worst part of the film was just the fact that the plot was incredibly thin. Like the first half was cool when he was coherent but clearly going crazy, but it lost a lot of steam after the stroke imo, and it's still an excellent performance, but watching a senile man mumble for like 45 minutes isn't that fun. That being said, the actual ending was really cool (the scene where he was insulting the dude in Italian was fucking GREAT, Tom Hardy did amazing there), and I liked the theme of him facing his past. I feel like it was a very intentional movie, it doesn't come off as something that they'd make just trying to look artsy, but I think the premise itself was stretched a half hour too long. I'd rather an Irishman like approach, an epic documenting his rise, time in Alcatraz, and his subsequent senility, but I understand that this was Trank's homage to movies like Barton Fink or the Shining. I feel like if he really wanted to do that, he'd be better served by just making the main character a fictional gangster, maybe based on Capone. That way he wouldn't have to fit within the confines of his story and could go a lot crazier with it. All in all, it's about a 6/10 for me.", "I know this movie is gonna be divisive but I also know that I fucking *loved* it\n\n\nTom Hardy was like a feral dog in it and it was a blast watching him sweat and murmer his way through every scene. There wasn't a lot going on, narratively, but for some reason I just didn't need that.

At any moment it seems like Capone could physically and/or mentally just implode. Linda Cardellini was really good too, but her character needed more scenes outside of Capone's perspective I think, just to establish more of a baseline for who she is or why Capone is with her. That goes for Juniour as well though, imo. The score made the entire thing feel like a nightmare, and I really did appreciate how effectively the film puts you into Capone's insane mindset.\n\nI for one am all for another Trank project like this.

One more? Give someone else a shot.", "Feel like I'm on a different planet reading some of these reviews.

Completely deglamorizes Capone, depicting him at the nadir of his life, Hardy looks like a Death in Venice style walking corpse. Hard to believe a film could even find a fresh angle on Al Capone after almost a century of depictions - I had never heard of this part of his story before.", "[deleted]", "Was intrigued for the first 15 minutes, then it just started sucking more and more. By the end I was pretty disappointed, even though going in I knew it wasn't going to be anything that great anyway.

This means that his sentence was only 3 years \u2014 as opposed to the 4-12 he was initially sentenced to receive.

You know, it'll never be over for me, because every day I feel pain.\" He wasn't the only one that expressed concerns over the film; Rosyln Public Schools also issued an official statement lashing out against the Hugh Jackman-led film: \"While the film is purportedly meant to entertain, it\u2019s important to remember that what occurred in our school district was far from entertaining\" (via The Roslyn News). While Tassone now enjoys a quiet life in New York, having repaid all the money he stole from the Rosyln School District, his podcast testimony suggests past crimes do still haunt him.

The shot composition was really effective in terms of setting the tone and atmosphere, going from open and happy at the beginning to stuffy and tense once information comes out. \\\nJackman and Janney were both fantastic and I really liked the chemistry they had even though they were only on screen for a few scenes together.\n\nI also really liked the choices they made in terms of revealing certain pieces of information. It made the scene of Jackman confronting Janney in her office make a lot more sense when you understand what \"I'm not the sociopath here\" really means. Not only does it force you to see the characters for who they really are, but it also makes the reveals much more satisfying once they finally are revealed.\n\nI also appreciated how they chose to flesh out Jackman's character beyond just a cartoon villain, Janney's character felt a little bordering on one dimensional 'rich housewife' but I had no issues with her delivery of the material. \n\nIt also really benefits from giving the characters enough motivation and opportunity to explain themselves and their frustrations with the system they're in so even though we may hate them, we understand why they did what they did.\n\nOverall just a really engaging experience that reminds you what journalism can do when it's done correctly.", "Rafael Casal!

Obviously, the movie is not about cars, but the series of real-life events is absolutely staggering and always seems to become progressively worse. Frank Tassone, played by Hugh Jackman, is astonishingly well-liked and does good for the school and the community. He mentors students and has played a major part in making Roslyn High School one of the best in the state. The same could be said for Pam Gluckin, played by Allison Janney.\n\nSo, when the first budget fraud (essentially stealing) manifests itself, it plays out like an insane revelation to us and a sense of disloyalty to the community. Once that first domino falls, the movie sets itself into high gear and becomes a viciously entertaining ride to the end. Every character from there on out is on edge and all the actors portray that heightened sense of tension with ease. Hugh Jackman stood out as the superintendent. He slowly loses grip over his job and becomes cynical of his surroundings, which makes for some of the best scenes the movie has to offer.\u00a0\n\nThe movie also passed the midnight test for me, which is basically testing the engagement level of a movie by pressing play at midnight.

It's just not a good example that can be given to a innocent kid that does not understand how a \"normal\" family should behave.\nI don't know, but the -social services- being the \"evil\" was way too much. It was gross for me, imagine for a little kid.", "I have this theory that they died in the end that's why it was the only part that was unrealistic. That's why Jane said \"One last what if\" because she was thinking and imagining what would have happened if they stayed alive. Hence in the song \"There's no need for goodbyes now I'm seeing the light\". Also at the beginning of the story, it said that it was a tragic story.", "I absolutely loved it, I feel that it shows kids a family friendly way of emotional abuse and physical abuse.\n\nWe need to show kids more of this so they can understand it more and know the signs and I personally feel this did a great job in showing that.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s cup of tea but I thought it was great", "The most redeeming part of the movie is the animation itself, but otherwise the characters were not my cup of tea, the plot was trying way too hard to justify itself, and I feel the handling if it\u2019s messages was problematic for a movie that features child abuse. \n\nThe main characters were unlikable in my opinion, which I feel was intentional on the part of the writers because they wanted to show how abused children don\u2019t need to be perfect to deserve to be saved from their situation or to be shown love, kindness, and patience, but that they didn\u2019t know how to actually implement this. \n\n\nThe older brother for example is clearly trying to be responsible and watch out for his siblings while struggling with the brunt of their family\u2019s abuse, and it feels like the movie doesn\u2019t acknowledge that enough because they instead wanted to focus on how Jane was the writer\u2019s favorite. (Which I\u2019m convinced she only was because she could be used for the award-bait song.)\n\nIt would have made more sense actually if Jane had been the one who made the mistake of trying to get rid of the Nanny because it fits her character more for her to selfishly want to do whatever she wants without listening to an authority figure. That was her whole gripe with Tim even though he was trying to make their lives better. It would have been a more interesting character arc than just making her out to be the embodiment of \u2018hope\u2019 who is always right or whatever. Tim instead is reduced to the over controlling buttmonkey that the narrative treats badly because he isn\u2019t perfect.\n\nMeanwhile Jane got away with being a dangerously selfish person, such as taking ALL the food for herself when their parents aren\u2019t feeding them, despite knowing she had *two much younger brothers* who were starving just as much as she was, or letting her brother be the scapegoat for everything when she causes trouble. \n\nThe problem is that she didn\u2019t have any real redeeming qualities because her whole character is about her being the embodiment of hope, but they don\u2019t even show this to the audience; instead her behaviors are just random. We\u2019re never show her just being hopeful about having a happy loving family for herself, just singing and putting everyone in danger while the narrative bends itself into a pretzel trying to make her the big good. She is only called out for being selfish in one scene, only for letting Tim be the scapegoat but never for hogging all the food so her siblings could starve, but they try to equate her selfishness with Tim\u2019s controlling and tendencies, when her selfishness was ten times more harmful to others than Tim\u2019s actually was. \n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t even make sense for Tim to not know how to get real food instead of trying to feed his family a fake lobster. That plot point is completely contrived. It doesn\u2019t make sense for him to make GOOD food, but at the very least to know how to get bread and cheese. Come on!\n\nThe twins are also called creepy several times without actually being that bad, but I feel this was the writers trying to get away with no actually giving them a personality besides being inventors. Which also doesn\u2019t make sense because they were the ones who carried the whole plot and got things done. They should have been the main characters *long* before Jane. \n\nLinda the nanny was... alright, but the movie was also trying to make her out to be the perfect mother figure for the kids but was doing so in the most short handed of ways versus really doubling down on her love for the children. For example they did it by using oats as shorthand for her caring for them as if that fixes all problems when really the kids needed therapy and someone who could listen and make them feel safe. Instead the movie focused on her being hyper and quirky. \nSo all in all I didn\u2019t find the characters likable at all, and this makes the movie feel less enjoyable and more like an outrage.\n\nBut the plot of the movie is also very jumbled in a way that I think means the writers were so much more attached to the idea of making an adventure film while also trying to attach a message about family to the end of it than actually making a good movie with a good message. \n\nI have seen other movies on Netflix that HAVE been able to handle the theme of family with a lot more heart while also being interesting. This one I think they just had the idea of what scenes they wanted to make, but they didn\u2019t focus as much attention in the development of the family themes in a way that could be taken as seriously. \n\nThe parents for example are odious to the point that you *do* want to see them die, but I actually chalk that up more to their weirdness like when the husband keeps... purring... it felt gross. But they are treated by the film as just so ridiculous and are given just a tad too much focus that the film doesn\u2019t give the abuse the children suffer enough gravitas. \n\nIf the film had spent more time displaying the effects of starvation, and neglect, and emotional abuse than just one *gag* about being hungry, one scene of the girl looking sad while it rains, and Tim just hanging out on the coal pile, then the direness of their situation would have strengthened their stance and made up actually feel something for them. And they also didn\u2019t display how the children\u2019s relationship to each other is important either. \n\nWe are shown the kids squabbling and betraying each other so often that you almost feel as if they would have been *better off* having separate families that could give them each the love and care they deserved without being toxic to one another. One message this movie didn\u2019t do well is that for your own health and well-being you do not have to put up with toxic and harmful people. They tried with sending the parents away, but then they tried to make it seem like being all together with them would be better than being with other families that were all clearly loving and providing for them. \n\nThe kids don\u2019t work together and instead are dangerously selfish to the point they resemble their parents. Like the above point of Jane taking all the food for herself while everyone else starves. But somehow we\u2019re supposed to be rooting for them to stay together? If there had been a scene of the siblings sharing what little they have and being a support for each other then the concept of them needing to stay together would have been more believable and would have helped make the plot make more sense. \n\nFor example if they showed the coal basement as a more fearsome environment, or showed the kids sadder about being starved, this would have hammered home the need for the kids to get the hell out of there.\nInstead it suffers from the same kind of problems that books like Harry Potter or Matilda suffered from when they play off an abusive family as funny. \n\nAnd finally I think the handling of child protective services is a horrible message to make for children when the core theme is of a bunch of kids escaping their abusive parents! Child protective services are there to actually get children out of horrible situations in real life. One of the first things that abusive parents use against their kids is telling them that the mean of CPS will take them away and making them out to be bad so that the parent can continue to harm them. So it is horrible to paint them as evil when the reality is that some kids are taught not to seek help when they need it and this kind of movie actually highlights that message. \n\nThey also have a horrible message about families in general when they keep on trying to act as if adopted families aren\u2019t \u2018real\u2019 families: Tim goes to several good families with prospective parents who were willing to love and care for him, and the movie really dismisses all the adoptive parents and treats the issue as if they aren\u2019t important because they aren\u2019t the children\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 family, and that is a horrible message.\n\nSo those were my problems with the film. The only redeeming quality is the plot about Ruth finding a good home, but honestly if the movie had been about filling her journey it would have been a much better film. Even if it was just a movie about the Colonel learning about how to raise and care for a child, that is a much more compelling film than what we got. And it\u2019s not because she is a baby; if it was a film about how growing up to become a troubled child in any way even then that would have been a better story. \n\nSo yeah, I watched it for the animation, but that\u2019s really about it.", "Just wanted to say I watched this movie while I was tripping on acid and this shit was AMAZING", "9/10", "The Nanny Capult going off into the streets could have been the best joke of the year", "Not bad.

Nothing you haven\u2019t seen before and it\u2019s kinda predictable.  Hemsworth\u2019s haunted, withdrawn, badass merc is an archetype we\u2019re all familiar with but he plays it about as well can be, looking particularly gruff and handling the action stuff in a manner befitting someone accustomed to a blockbuster superhero franchise.  Some of the greenscreen compositing is poor and noticeable but usually pretty brief.  \n\nI sound like I\u2019m being dismissive here, but this movie hit my sweet spot, inasmuch as I have a pretty high tolerance for well-made but otherwise run of the mill action movies.  I gobble up direct to video action fluff like Skittles and this is certainly near the top for me.  The production is handsome and technically proficient, the performances are strong, and the action - most importantly - is plentiful and brutal.\n\nThis is a humorless film, filled with blood, bullets, beatdowns, and broken glass.  It has a grit and severity to it.  No quips, no one liners, just an objective and an opposition to that objective.  It\u2019s a vehicle to facilitate a number of set pieces and has a propulsive pace that still remembers to slow down and breathe once in a while.\n\nA while back I praised another Netflix action thriller, Triple Frontier, itself a story of guns for hire on a mission that goes awry.  It too had a grounded sensibility to it and I think would make a fine double pairing with this film.  Whereas I feel the character stuff was stronger in Triple Frontier (by virtue of being a story about a tight knit group of men), Extraction wins in the, well, Action.  I would say tonally it\u2019s most similar to the \u201cheroic bloodshed\u201d movies that came out of Hong Kong in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s; nobody here walks out with a clean shirt, if you catch my meaning.  Pardon if this is an outdated, un-PC term, but these are quintessential \u201cguy\u201d movies, through and through.\n\nI think there\u2019s plenty of room for movies like this to exist.  Sure, it\u2019s a little generic, but just because a movie doesn\u2019t come out and change the way we look at cinema doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s without merit.  If you\u2019re a fan of 80\u2019s shoot em ups where body count is directly proportional to entertainment value, give this a watch.  If you ever wanted to see Thor CQC some motherfuckers with knives, handguns, car doors, and grenade launchers, then add it to your queue post haste.\n\nI give it 4 sniper headshot sprays out of 5", "It was fun.

I really hope it does well enough for a sequel or prequel", "I was ready for another generic action movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like with John Wick you could tell this was directed by someone in the stunt world. Long takes and good choreography. Sam Hargrave has been the stunt coordinator for a couple of Marvel movies if I remember correctly, and it's pretty clear they don't give him any artistic freedom with the action in those, because this was on another level. I hope the continues directing.", "As a Bangladeshi this was way way better than it could ever be. The action scenes were great. Chris Hemsworth's performance was great, way better than it was in Blackhat (watched that movie with high expectations only to get disappointed). Only thing that bothered me was that the Bengali accents were a bit too weird; we Bangladeshis don't speak like that generally. The yellow-green color cast to make the atmosphere more 'dirty' was also a minor nitpick. But it was nice to finally see our country in a major film as the primary setting. Good 7/10 movie in my opinion, not great but not terrible.", "Hemsworth has a lot of charisma. Makes watching him fun when he isnt being directed to be too serious.

No one liked the depiction of the city as a shithole ruled by a druglord. A lot of hate on Facebook for the movie. The truth is, Dhaka has a modern, clean side too. Then again, India isn't what Slumdog Millionaire made it seem like. I'm sure Mexico isn't what Sicario made it seem like. So... I don't agree with these people.\n\nThe production design was top notch and it felt like Dhaka, mixing footage in with drone shots of the actual city. Most of the bangla accents were good, except for the main druglord Asif who clearly seemed to be struggling.\n\nIn terms of my personal view of the movie, I really enjoyed it. I grew up loving Speed and Die Hard. I'm a sucker for the John Wick movies. That one-take sequence was amazing, even with a few of the hidden cuts being visible.

Tyler lost his son, and he makes it his personal mission to save Ovi when everyone tells him not to, because he has the guilt if abandoning his own son, and doesn\u2019t want to do that again.\n\nAlso the part about falling into a river but not drowning. The river is depression or shutting yourself out because of killing and seeing death. Both Tyler and Ovi have killed people, them sitting at the bottom of the water symbolises feeling heavy and the weight of what they\u2019ve done, but they rise back up. \u201cYou don\u2019t drown unless you stay submerged.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s something they both innately felt - to escape but also symbolising that they keep moving on.", "Id love a sequel where ovi gets revenge on that sob gangster kid", "[deleted]", "A big budget film focusing on a former SAS operator...about time", "Imagine the blurred man at the end is actually Liam Hemsworth, who also served in the SAS but has come out of retirement to avenge his brother. \n\nBOOM!", "Best moment of the film is when Rake slaps the shit out of those `little shits'...", "Hey Netflix, \nIf you ever make a sequel, find a way to bring Saju back!!!", "Well worth it.

To save one life?

More like the comic was a direct pitch for a possible movie. That's been the trend for a while. This movie doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's predictable. Just because the Russo's are responsible for some big-money Marvel movies doesn't mean they're these great scriptwriters. The script was weak in my opinion. This didn't even have to be based on a comic at all. It's fairly cookie-cutter with some small, fillable yet unfilled holes in the plot.\n\nI thought nothing of Chris Hemsworth's casting until after the movie I did some homework. To a slight degree, I agree with the miscasting of him as a \"white male saviour.\" I also understand a producer is gonna cast a lead that's gonna make them money. It's a business. I get it. I really do.\n\nThe one and only, I'd say, great thing about this movie is the director and his style. There's clear inspiration from Gareth Evans. As Sam Hargrave's first feature length film, I gotta say, I'm impressed. That's not an easy thing to do with me. I'd love to see what he can do with a better script.\n\nI read complaints that the movie was too bloody. Those complainers are pussies. It's an action movie. It's rated R. Seriously. You wanna know the other good thing about this movie? Practical blood splatter effects. CGI blood splatter pisses me off so much. Not that this movie didn't have any but it wasn't nearly as blatant and ubiquitous as, say, Marvel's The Punisher or Westworld. A big BRAVO from me on that!! The fight choreography was only ok. I had some flashes of gun kata from Equilibrium during some scenes, not gonna lie.\n\nI gave the movie 6 out of 10 stars. Not a high or strong 6 but still a 6.

Most very well done with limited shaky cam.\n* Happy that Chris Hemsworth did a non-Marvel movie that is successful\n* Interaction between Tyler and Ovi, that scene probably was the only one with a lot of emotional weight in it and explained a lot about why Tyler wanted to keep Ovi alive, because he wanted to purge himself of the guilt for going to war, rather than face seeing his son die of lymphoma (cancer)\n* Tyler's friend looking at his \"pills\" and taking TWO, just because.\n* When Tyler's handler \"took care\" of the drug lord in her beautiful, billowing gown.\n\n**Disappointments**\n\n* When Tyler finally called Saju and said \"I need your help\", I was waiting for the epic Saju & Tyler team up but it never happened, why!??\n* The kid he bitch slapped shot him. Ugh.\n* He had to kill his friend.\n\nEnjoyable flick.

The movie shines due to Chris Hemsworths presence and the cool action sequences. They attempted to have character development and bonding moments with Rake and the kid but it felt forced. Shave 30 mins of pointless scenes where the movie drags on I feel like it would be exponentially a better film. Cut the fat and get to the good stuff.

All of the action following that scene wasn't as good and the plot became way more cliche the longer it ran.", "Overall enjoyed it, but only for those seeking a violent action flick. \n\nI think that the body count started to feel unrealistic. If this was real life, I can easily see terrorism charges against Mr Rake, and also see his home country Australia ensuring him returned to Bangladesh (either by the Australian Federal Police, or even guessing that the Australian military only sanctions merceries who work for sanctioned private companies). I checked and there is bilateral extradition between Australia and India, but not Bangladesh. Frankly I felt a lot of empathy for the many policemen who were simply doing their job. Maybe they knew their mission was partially corrupted, but probably many didn't. Someone's shooting your brothers dead and you're going to stop the killing. It felt unrealistic that a police chief and so many police would be shot, yet Australia or other host countries would be OK with this behaviour of a private operator, working for a drug lord no less. \n\nWe've seen assassinations in real life and dramatised such as Khashoggi or Spielberg's Munich. If you look at Sicario and Soldado, while there is a high (but lower) body count, I think it more matches the what characters, the state actors, and what politics would allow. Perhaps extraction is harder than assassination, but my criticism still holds. And these films aren't short on suspense or tension.\n\nPerhaps this is now fitting with the genre (John Wick) that there has to be a high body count and lots of creativitiy for the protagonist in how he despatches \"the evil people opposing him\", but it's feeling gratituous to me. I think JW gets away with such a (record??) body count because it's humorous at points and there's an unrealness to it - it's too fantastic to feel real, hence I'm not thinking about realism and consequences.\n\nI loved seeing a different country/culture/setting for the action - in fact I was excited to see how they would do it, and am interested in the reception it had in India and Bangladesh - how do the locals and Indians feel about the story, script, and characters?\n\nLastly, despite all the criticism kudos to Hemsworth for a strong lead to the film. Decent acting given it's not an overly dramatic role. Perhaps this is a reaction to my enojoyment of him in Marvel, but I think he's very talented and can play well giants who are soft on the inside . Would love to see him in more dramatic or comedic roles - I think he and Disney just NAILED Ragnarok and Avengers 3/4.", "9/10.  10/10 if Hemsworth's character wasn't named Tyler Rake.  \n\nIt's honestly a really good action movie.  Maybe it takes itself too seriously but I liked how dark it was.  It gave the characters depth, which I wasn't expecting from this type of movie.  \n\nDavid Harbour was a nice/perfect surprise but his character made no sense.\n\nThe unkillability of the two main guys was kinda annoying but o well I guess that has to be forgiven for action movies like this.\n\nAlso, 16 minutes of credits?  Really?  It's ok to say it's 1:50 and it honestly could've ended a little sooner.", "Story and plot were straightforward. Didn't expect anything from an action movie, but for an action movie I liked what I got. The third act needed a bit more work though, because the excellent camera work and choreography weren't as present as it was in the end of act 1. It helps that the director was a stunt coordinator too.\n\nI noticed a lot of inspiration from movies like John Wick and the Raid movies, particularly Raid 2. The John Wick director was also part of a stunt team if I recall correctly. Hemsworth definitely did some training, they kept the camera shots wide and made sure you can see that it was the actor performing those moves.\n\nThe car chase reminds me of the scene from the Raid 2, particularly this scene\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kxb9xzAaYjM.\n\nThe only thing that was lacking was the setting made it kind of forgettable. It's great to see another country portrayed that isn't Mexico or Eastern Europe, but it was just a hue of yellow and brown just like any other action movie set in a foreign country. They just traded one set of brown people to another set of brown people and had the one white guy gunning them all down to save the brown kid. Would've been nice to see Sadu be the one who stayed alive and got the kid home, he was the one with more character since he had his wife and kid to go home to and had more riding on his success than Hemsworth's character, who was in it for the money or the suicide mission. \n\nAlas ultimately it was Nik who brought the kid home, her character wasn't as invested or even fleshed out. Did they get the rest of the money? Was the dad happy? The ending just felt unrewarding.\n\nAll in all solid 3/5. Great action sequences, great performances. Story and setting is forgettable.\n\nEdit: Grammar", "Oh look, the yellow poverty filter for the Global South, and haunt of the Great White Saviour. Normally it's Mexico, or anywhere non-Western and hot, that gives a good loading of grit, grime and dust storms (despite Dhaka having 4x the rainfall of London).

It's nice to finally have something with scenes of high quality enough that I can lump together with The Raid 1 and 2. Well done to the first time director and Chris Hemsworth for leaning hard into the stunt work and effort behind making some of these moments work.", "I always wanted a movie which combined elements form \u2018John Wick\u2019 and \u2018The Raid\u2019. This is exactly that. The amount of times I could pinpoint action scenes which seemed mirroring of either of those two movies is countless. Examples include Thor killing the dude with a rake, putting various enemies through tables or glass or John Wick influence would include the professionally choreographed gun fights with Thor handling his rifle consistently well (way he reloads/holds it etc)  in a some what \u2018immersive\u2019 manner. And no, I\u2019m not saying him taking out 250 Bangladeshi cops is realistic but it\u2019s very entertaining.", "The Goonies from hell lmao", "He broke a dude with another dude!", "Much better than what I thought it would be going into it. The action was actually fantastic. Tyler and Saju actually get tired instead of just continuing to fight as if they have unlimited stamina. The choreography was pretty amazing and each hit felt like it actually had weight to it. Most of it was clear, wide and with minimal cuts. Hemsworth was on some serious John Wick style training with firearms and not once did I see him shoot more than his mags allowed, plus some pretty neat reloads and tons of double taps.\n\nAlso props to Randeep Hooda, dude is a certified badass. I've never heard of him until this and I would easily watch a movie with him starring.\n\nPretty ballsy to kill him off, I doubt the end scene was actually him, just Ovi seeing him like Tyler saw his kid. My only complaints are the horrible yellow filter on it and David Harbour being criminally underutilized.\n\nSolid 7.5/10 for an action movie.", "I like how Hemsworth is actually large enough to convince he can take out twelve guys at a time. \n\nMost action movies feel like they\u2019re using Movie Magic^TM to explain how Bruce Willis or Gerard Butler can get shot/stabbed/punched five or six times and still do the fight scenes, but Hemsworth is so unrealistically large and muscular that I\u2019m convinced he COULD get hit with a car twice (three times?) fall off a ledge, get cut in a knife fight, and still win whatever fight he\u2019s in. The man\u2019s huge. And with a background in Muay Thai, so I\u2019m convinced he can give out those bone-breakers\n\nEDIT: Okay, fine guys, maybe not Gerard Butler. I was gonna say Jack Bauer instead, but I was worried about 24 fans getting upset. I mean guys with stronger-than-average but basically normal-LOOKING physiques.", "The action scenes are obviously well done, and ~~Christ~~ ~~Chris~~ Christ Hemsworth was a lot of fun to watch as a complete badass, but the story was just the dumbest thing ever. By the end all I was thinking was \"All of this carnage and destruction over a goddamn kid? It can't be worth it.\" Which isn't to say that the hero's goal wasn't worth it, but for the villain it essentially boiled down to them tearing up the entire city just to kill a rival drug lord's son. Not the actual rival drug lord, just his... son? \n\nAnd maybe I missed a detail so someone correct me if I'm wrong but, why did Saju get involved at all. What I thought I heard from the movie is that the dad didn't want to pay the mercenaries to extract his son, so he sent in Saju, which only made things worse seeing as how they were well on their way to getting the kid out of there without a hitch. It was just mind-numbingly idiotic. And the second David Harbour shows up, you just instantly know he's going to try to give up the kid with the whole cliched \"betrayal\" bit. \n\nBut yeah, that long-take sequence was pretty cool.\n\nEDIT: Keeping the typo because it made me laugh reading it back.", "Anyone have any idea where the cliff jumping scene was filmed??

When I watch horror films, I tend to try to imagine and strategise how I would escape if I was in the main character's situation and you see the characters try to think of various solutions to the problem, convincing and coercing others to share food and sending the authorities a message to show they have learned their lesson about appreciating food or helping others. But then at the end when you see how many more floors there are than originally assumed, you realise there wasn't enough food even if everyone only ate what they needed and they weren't intended to learn a lesson but simply suffer and die. They went through all that for nothing, that got to me more than the gore. Gripping film though and I think it does make a statement about society, with those on top blaming the poor for their problems, saying if only they'd work harder, help each other, abstain from luxuries etc they could make it without acknowledging the reality and restrictions of the situation. I felt the ending was bit frustrating because I'm a more practical thinking person and a lot of the plot was more symbolic and allegorical, so I was left wanting answers like where did the girl come from and what happens when she gets to the top when that's not really the point I guess.

Until I came to reddit and I saw some conversation explaining what I missed. I didn\u2019t realize that the ending was actually in the middle. Once goreng got to the 333rd floor he was already dying and the hallucinations had been running wild. He hallucinated the girl, and that\u2019s why the room didn\u2019t change in temperature when they gave her the panna cotta. So goreng and his friend died, and the panna cotta was sent back up, with nothing but a hair on it. The people at level 0 thought nothing of it other than it wasn\u2019t eaten due to a piece of hair. This just goes to show that they were ignorant to how the vertical system was run and the inequality and horror that was happening, that they thought it was merely too disgusting to be eaten because of a measly hair. \n\nCan someone please dissect with me, why do you think the \u201cmom\u201d of the child at the end would ride the platform to the bottom every time, if she never had a child to begin with? Just like imoguiri said, she never came in with a child. The storyline of the woman having a child was only from trimagasi\u2019s mouth. The child was just a product of goreng\u2019s imagination. So if this is true, why would she be riding the platform? What was the purpose if she didn\u2019t have a child? Also, if she actually did have a daughter, it\u2019s not like she stopped people from eating, so it\u2019s not like she was saving any food for the daughter. This is the only plot hole for me, unless I\u2019m missing something. \n\nAlso does anyone feel like there is any significance in the number \u201c 333\u201d?", "I like the theory that the kid at the end was Goreng's hallucination, and that they did in fact send the dessert up to the top floor, and the scene we see earlier (with the administrator guy attacking the cooks about there being a hair in it) is the outcome. Basically the people up top didn't understand the symbol, they thought the food was sent back up because it was flawed (the hair) even though the people in the pit would never have cared about something like that. In other words, it was a good allegory for the idea that the people up top can't relate to the struggle that the people at the bottom face.", "The biggest shock for me was \"Imugiuri\" talking about all the behind the scenes stuff and all of it Falling apart showing how wrong she is...\n\nMiharu not having a kid (or did she?)\n\nThere are no one under 16 here (there's a kid)\n\nThere are only 200 floors (333*)\n\nIt added to the shock for me seeing the people who worked there didn't even know what the place became.", "[deleted]", "So um, what was the message I was supposed to take away from this?  \n\nI was following what they were trying to do by having the untouched dessert make its way back to the top, but once they abandoned that idea in favor of the kid being the message, I had no idea what they were trying to achieve.", "I saw a man shit on another man in Spanish", "[deleted]", "Great throughout but that ending was absolute trash..", "The Spanish are pretty generous all things considered, murica would have this boy empty by floor 20", "A great concept on paper, the movie built a lot of dread very effectively and showed the main characters unraveling quite well too.\n\nUltimately, the movie was unable to wrap itself up effectively, losing its footing around the last third I would say.\n\nI think it really lost me when the main character was able to convince baharat to join him so easily on what was a suicide mission more or less, and then their quest became not to survive the climb to the bottom, but to preserve a \"message\" that could convince management to end the pit.\n\nI think the movie's perfect representation of a extreme capitalist society worked metaphorically, but that they should have stuck with the characters trying to escape the system, rather than a penna cotta or a little girl being enough to completely change the system. Too heavy handed", "It's an allegory of how society fails to solve the puzzle of resources, power, and everybody's well being without the leap of faith that's required through SOLIDARITY and COMPASSION.\n\nCapitalism's failure is explored extensively because it promotes individualism, suspicion and competition. Socialism is the answer... but, as in any socialist regime, it requires class struggle solidarity AND also force, at least at the beginning, due to people's corruption and/or despair. As shown, it's easier to be open to solidarity when you have abundance -but not that much of it. It takes a leap of faith, though, to give up your comforts and help others downstream. It also takes A LEADER, a messiah...\n\nThe movie uses the Bible's *Feeding of the Five Thousand* from (*Matthew 14:13-21; Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17*) to set up the premise: \"Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. 12And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, \u201cGather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.\u201d 13So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.\u2026\". The movie even cites a passage verbatim and Trimagasi responds with amen.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the Bible explores in depth how to go about our challenges with resources. It's THE NEVER ENDING STRUGGLE of humanity, where spiritual meets economics, psychology and sociology.\n\nSymbolism and other details:\n\n1. In the intro: \"There are three kinds of people: the ones above, the ones below, and the ones who fall\". 'The ones who fall' means there is limited to no upward mobility but plenty of risk to completely fall off of society. Falling means despair, giving up (suicide or murder).\n2. The heavily structured and rules-driven setting symbolizes the heartless, societal machine that creates structural class violence aimed downward.\n3. There is enough food for everybody's needs, not desires. Note that while there's not enough food for 333x2 people in the platform in one given day, there is enough for all to survive in a given month. Yet, the gluttony, lack of solidarity, and suspicion (I'll eat all I can or I may starve next month) of the higher floors is what creates the drama down below ie poverty. Crime as well as the diseases of despair (suicide) happen in poverty.\n4. The upper levels are shown as callous, defecating on the ones below but it's also shown how it comes back to bite them in the butt. People in the upper levels are shown at ease with one another and even collaborative, although cutthroat (literally), because there is abundance. However, they count on the tables changing and having to potentially kill and eat their partner. Also, Baharat's attempt to go upward captured the black struggle. He worships God but the whites ask him suspiciously \"what God?\".\n5. Goreng is the messiah. He bears the message. His Don Quixote book is like sacred scripture. He then jump starts the revolution guiding people and makes the ultimate sacrifice.\n6. Trimagasi symbolizes selfishness, self-preservation. He's shown as opposite to Imoguiri in Goreng's hallucinations as an angel/devil pair up.\n7. Imoguiri symbolizes solidarity and nurture. She does the right thing and tries to convince others about having solidarity. Goreng, cynical at that point, then helps her \"use their privilege to dismantle privilege\" using their leverage ie the threat of spoiling something valuable (the food) for others to comply. As Goreng says \"I cannot shit upward\" meaning he has no leverage with the folks above.\n8. Imoguiri ends up making the ultimate sacrifice, not wastefully, but as a gift. A \"Why do you think I hung myself? It would have been much easier to jump like the rest does. But I wanted to leave a present for you, Goreng. My body, I want you to feed off my body to digest it and expel it like redeeming shit. Alright? \\*\\*REMEMBER SOLIDARITY OR CRAP\\*\\*\". She calls out Trimagasi telling him \"You call him (Goreng) stupid? Really? You are talking to \\*\\*THE MESSIAH\\*\\*, the messiah of crap but the messiah anyway.\" She urges him to eat her and drops a reference to the Bible **John 6,** **Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand** *\"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.\"* While in the movie it is presented quite literally, note that the meaning in the Bible is meant as a way to convey that as long there is a developed sense of solidarity and trust ie faith in the process (in \"God's way of doing things\"), nobody shall starve. Move away from this, get individualistic, and society breaks down.\n9. While coercion can work in making people get on the plan, Sr. Brambang (Baharat's mentor) insoists they are better off trying to convince rather than coerce. It works but force is also necessary with those that won't bulge. Interesting to note is that the lower the levels, the harder to convince people because despair starts to take over. However, in the bottom ones, where there is NO hope, they are met with open arms.\n10. At the end, when moribund, Goreng reads: \u201cA great man who is vicious will be a great example of vice and a rich man who is not generous will be merely a miserly beggar, for the possessor of wealth is not made happy by possessing it but by spending it, and not by spending it as he pleases but by knowing how to spend it well.\u201dTrimagasi then appears and tells him: \"'Know how to spend it well'. It was bold of you to piss away all the riches from level 6, my snail.\" Goreng: \"I didn't piss it away...\". Trimagasi: \"The girl has a gift. Haven't you realized that?\".\n11. The girl symbolizes innocence, hope for the future. She, as well as the untouched panna cotta, is a testament to people collaborating so that the next generation has a chance. Sending those highly desired elements upward is powerful... or not but the process does change the people sending the message. That might be all it takes to change people in the pit.\n12. \"The message doesn't need a bearer\". Means the message of the movement outlasts and eclipses the revolutionary leaders and aims to inspire future generations.\n13. BONUS: the kitchen staff upstairs symbolize the seemingly crafted abundance that nature provides. You can call the chef-like figure God, in a religious sense, or the Universe/nature, in a more secular, materialistic sense.", "I've been wondering about the high speed that the food platform moves at when it's on its way back up. At the end, the dude puts the little girl on the platform, but wouldn't she just end up as a red smear on the ceiling once the platform reached the top because of how fast it's moving? Even if it slowed down as it approached the top, the girl would still have been flung upward and likely died, no?

China on the other hand is cruel to animals.", "Interesting film, but its message doesn't really make sense when you think of the lore.\n\nFor example:\n\nThis is a minor issue, but the elevator moves so fast that it looks like you would die from the g-forces. I assumed nobody used the elevator to go up because you would be a blood smear. However, we learn that's not the case.\n\nThe mom had been riding the elevator for months. That means she has probably been to Floor 0 multiple times. This means that she has seen EVERY LEVEL and would've found her daughter on the first round of doing it.\n\nThe mother has only been around for 10 months? Right? How does she have a kid several years of age? I assumed the movie was implying that she may have been raped (which we see multiple attempts) and that's how she has a kid and has learned the defenses against it. But 10 months is not enough time to have a kid above the age of 1 month.\n\nHonestly, if you can ride the elevator to get to floor 0, why didn't Goreng and Baharat ride the elevator up? Actually, I'm also confused as to why Baharat even died. Did I miss something? I know he got one cut earlier, but it was implied that he killed both of the guys on that one floor.\n\nAlso, if one can ride the elevator to floor 0, then you think EVERYONE would've done it by now especially those in the lowest levels. They have nothing to lose and it seems like a one way ticket to where the food comes from.\n\nWhy did they give the girl the Panna cotta? They literally just killed dozens of people and then get teary eyed for a little girl when she wants the food. Also, this is probably the LAST AND ONLY TIME THEY CAN TRY THIS TEST since they nearly died getting to that point and had to murder a ton of people with their communist regime to get it down there. They could literally send the Panna Cotta up and if nothing happens then send the girl up. Giving her the food is irrelevant to sending her up to the top. She didn't need the food if they were just going to send her up in a minute.\n\nWhy would saving the girl be a message? What does it prove? I know thematically the movie is stating that \"it is up to the next generation to figure things out\" but that doesn't mean anything to the movie's plot or lore. Why didn't they all just ride the elevator up? Would it hurt for everyone to be at floor 0? There's no indication that it would be.\n\nWhy didn't floor 333 burn up when the Panna Cotta wasn't placed on the platform? I thought that was a pretty strict rule.\n\nWhy didn't the main characters jump on the platform as soon as they heard it was lowering? They just waddle over to the edge and watch it get further and further away?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ending had a lot of moments that lost me. I also wasn't sure if the maker of the movie was aware that the protagonist who was mockingly called \"a communist\" for wanting to distribute food equally eventually forms a stereotypical communist regime: We kill everyone who disagrees with what we think is best... which eventually we change our mind on what we think is best and it turns out that we didn't need to kill anyone in the first place as we change our mission to saving the girl instead of distributing food to the poor. At first I thought this was an intentional allegory of how Communist Regimes form but the characters in the movie never seem to be self-aware that they are brutally murdering people without even fully explaining what they are doing. Heck, they could just hit people in the stomach but they always go for headshots and instant-kills. If the characters became more aware of what they were doing I think it would be a good allegory but they never have a \"what the heck are we doing?\" kind of moment.\n\nAnd again: Why would saving the girl be a message and why DIDN'T THEY SEND THE FOOD UP FIRST BEFORE SENDING HER UP!", "Why do movies that have a really cool premise seem to require a stupid ambiguous ending.\n\nGive your movie a fucking ending.", "I really enjoyed this one.

Either you hate everything about this film or you clearly dissect it. \n\nAnyhow I was wondering why I didn't come up with the solution of rationing food by traveling down and forcing people to eat only their part. It's because in the film it's mentioned that some bought guns inside like the old guy bringing a knife. So if you did force someone to eat their rations you would just get shot. So you never truly have power over someone below you. I was waiting for  someone to do that but I guess they just forgot. A minor plot hole if you ask me.\n\nThe girl also seems to be on the last floor on purpose by the administration as she is clearly not starving and therefore is the message.\n\nI liked the ending, the message and everything except the gore.", "the ending sucked made me feel like the whole movie was a waste of time, but the middle of the movie was getting a little bit better. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nthey could have ended it better and the old man was annoying", "just watched it... i am confusion\n\n\namerica exblayn", "I watched the movie hours ago.

Accept it and enjoy.", "Something I haven't read:\n\nI found it interesting that the Administration knew when a prisoner was keeping food. Perhaps via cameras, or sensors on the food. So, the people that enforce the 'no hoarding food' rule must know what happens in the prison all along.\n\nIf that is the case, the 'message' is futile because the people who are running the place already know that all the food is gone by level 100, and know that there are more levels from the burnt body as Gerong and Bharat were descending. It just makes the movie that much more hopeless. Just my thoughts. \n\nAs for the confusion about the ending, the girl, and the panna cotta, I believe the truth was more hidden that what actually happened. Or, maybe just my interpretation.\n\n* When Gerong and Bharat enter the last level, Gerong hallucinates the girl. The girl isn't real, but rather a metaphor that the children are the message, a precious, living thing.\n* Bharat dies on  floor 333 from blood loss from a deep gash in his stomach, and Gerong takes the message from him. Bharat doesn't see the girl.\n* Floor 333 is a metaphor for hell. 666 people in the system, the devil's number. \n* The platform continues to move down because there is no-one below them, no-one to hoard food from.\n* The next day, Gerong takes the platform down to the bottom in order to be the 'bearer' of the message. At this point he is half dead, and so the old man (ghost/hallucination) tells him that he doesn't have to be the bearer of the message, he doesn't have to keep living.\n* The message is taken the wrong way by the chefs. (This is the scene in the middle where the head chef thinks the prisoners sent the food up because it had a hair in it) Note: the chefs believe that they are working to provide food, believe that they are helping the inmates when they are not. The prisoners don't take into consideration that the people at the top may be a part of the system as well, just like the chefs are left blind to what they allowing to happen.\n* The real entity at the top is the administration, the people who control the entire system, symbolism for a 'God' which has no body (not featured in film), who people is neither good nor bad, but rather a creator of the system. This also brings new meaning to \"God is in everyone\". Everyone is doing a part in continuing the system. (Cooks, Inmates, Employees etc.)", "Why doesn\u2019t everyone ride the platform back up?", "I feel like the movie should have focused on the inception of the pit rather than going full allegorical like they did. Like, rather than have Goreng arrive at a pit that has already established a hierarchy we could watch as the people originally try to form a working society only for it to fail.\n\nFor example, maybe they decide to ration the food like Goreng and Imoguri suggest, only for it to fall apart because one asshole decides to eat as much as he wants. Then, once the people below him realise they decide to eat more too because they have lost faith in the system, and don't want to get the short end of the stick. Resulting in no food for those in the deep levels and when those people get to the top, they decide not to ration food because they didn't get any when they were below.\n\nI dunno, I just feel like an exploration of society and how quickly a group can fall apart due to individual greed/callousness is more interesting than watching Goreng freak out for 90 minutes.", "This movie had a lot of potential and great scenes, but the ending was just an \"artsy\"/lazy cop-out.

And even taking the film as complete allegory to defend it doesn't hold up well. Regardless I thought the movie did an effective job building a serious dread for the situation. Moments like waking up at floor 202, or descending to the bottom only to discover there was never going to be enough food to sustain everyone really brought a terror I didn't expect to feel so severely hopeless. Because of this I'd say the journey was well worth the mild disappointment at the ending.", "People being randomly assigned a different level every month should have been a good catalyser for solidarity.\n\nI refuse to believe someone on a top floor would not save some food for the people below knowing it can be him in a few days.", "I think I'm the only one I've encountered who didn't mind how bleak and depressing the movie was. Maybe it's because I don't feel any level of bleakness can match reality and it's silly for people to say \"Real people would be nicer!\"", "I just watched it, and loved it, including the ending.  I had some plot hole / questions but most of them have been answered by comments here, so thanks everyone!\n\nI really appreciate the comment Toddy951 made - if everyone just ate their favorite food and left the rest, there would be enough for everyone.  I didn't think of that.  Though there is no way that that platform was large enough to hold 666 portions of food.  But, minor detail...\n\nSome other minor details (I love to nitpick this shit!) - where were the guns?  No way they wouldn't have been shot at some point while they were trying to stop people from eating and killing people who resisted their plan.  I know guns run out of bullets, but if I was in there with a 9mm with an average 18 bullet magazine, I'd only use it when I had to and make that shit last.  And I'd load it with an extended magazine that holds 100 bullets if possible..\n\nAlso, a lot of people dying every day.  Those people are only replaced at the end of the month, right?  So the amount of food needed to feed everyone would decrease drastically throughout the month.  The platform seemed to always be totally full though.  Unless they did daily population checks and crossed off menu items and we just didn't see that it seems like most everyone would be able to eat maybe halfway through the month or so.\n\nSpeaking of which - if the platform only comes once per day, and only stops for what, two minutes?  (it was hard to tell how long as it didn't seem consistent in the movie) it doesn't seem like you really could eat that much more than you needed, considering that's your only meal for 24 hours.", "I think there is a lot of time jumping and hallucination involved in the plot.\n\nThe kid might not be real. Pancotta was the real message as it got back to the surface.\nThere was a scene at around 1st third of the movie where the main chef makes a fuss about the single hair on the pancotta - I believe the only message the surface got is that \"guests\" did not eat the cake because there was hair in it.", "I have a question: In one of the scenes it shows that there is no way that Goreng could ride the platform to the top because of the speed at how the platform goes up is like a bullet train.

There are too many levels, too much scifi that's simply not realistic (that's a very tall building, there's quite a bit of dead people who are regularly cleaned up, etc) and it's unrealistic from a level perspective where vast majority by far would be dying as opposed to the reality of the world where relatively few die due to lack of resources.

While neither a horror or even really a thriller, its a rather depressing character study and a fascinating take on the many bizarre ways trauma can manifest itself. \n\nThe scene in the kitchen between Bennett and O'Hare (of whom I'm a huge fan of because of AHS and is one of the most underrated actors working today, he plays a slimy creep so well) was absolutely fantastic. I've often wondered how I would act if I confronted my own abuser, and some of the questions she asked really hit close to home (\"Am I the same as you?\"). Showing how universal the anxieties are for people who have had to deal with that. While also showing the long-term damage rape can cause, even if you are only the child of a rapist and haven't been through it yourself. \n\nThe cinematography is gorgeous with great compositions and use of light. Loved the use of pastel and cool toned colors. Bennett gives her best performance so far and I hope she gets more work. \n\nUltimately a satisfying, occasionally disturbing, and wonderfully shot and edited debut film.

And while the execution may not have been satisfactory for some (i.e. my dad who watched it with me), I found it extremely well done.

I'm not generally a person who can enjoy a movie on visuals alone, but the first half-ish of this looked good enough that I kept watching despite not really caring what was happening. I've seen Haley Bennett in movies before but I've always kinda hated the movies around her, and she's also very good in this. There was a \"year-so-far Oscars\" thread on here a week ago or so and she'd be my best actress through ~100 days. And then the movie that this becomes in the second half I really liked. The scene where she Hunter confronts her bio-dad was really poignant and I thought the ending was really satisfying.\n\nWhat I didn't like: I thought Richie and his parent's were really over-done, and you don't really get a good sense of them beyond being stock characters. This is especially true for the in-laws. I wish the movie had leaned into the body-horror side of things more, but that's maybe just my taste. For me the first half of the movie was a bit of a struggle to get through before the much stronger second half.\n\nSide note: going directly from marble to thumbtack seems like a fast escalation, but I guess I don't know enough about pica to really say.\n\nFor me the movie is kind of a mixed bag.

Barb in particular does kind of remind me of hardcore rockers who view all other music as inferior, Classical is Boring, Techno is just a bunch of beeps and Pop music is more or less the worst kind of music.\n\nIt was also interesting how it was revealed that Pop music was what originally caused the trolls to split up. Pop is by all accounts the newest or one of the newest among the genres and most of the time is essentially just borrowing elements from the other genres rather than having anything about it that makes it original.

I'm kind of surprised by how little the McElroy brothers were in it, I know they were only cameos but Justin is the only one with actual lines (not counting Skyscraper Troll).

Trolls get eaten, the Burgens are gross and ugly, there are actual shocking character moments and developments, and the humor and music contrasted and complimented it all in fun and clever ways.\n\nI feel like Trolls World Tour thought people\u2019s main takeaway from the first one was the music and humor so they tried to double down in that direction. I love the concept of different music Trolls tribes but they took that plot in the most bland and generic direction possible. I\u2019ve seen this plot 1000 times I feel like. Queen Barb and the rock trolls were easily the most fun and visually interesting of all the tribes, but I feel like she was a pretty tame villain and not as interesting villain as the burgens. Super heavy foreshadowing for her character development almost to a fault. I would\u2019ve at least liked if we got to actually see the Rock trolls raze and capture the other trolls at least once so we could get a little more of the dark tones that worked so well in the first movie. As it stands, the rock trolls never really feel very threatening or evil or even scary in the slightest because you can see exactly where they\u2019re going in the plot 10 minutes into the movie. The first movie, while it was still predictable that the burgens would turn nice at the end of the movie, there was at least a villain with conviction to keep the stakes high, and moments like one of the Trolls being \u201ckilled off\u201d on screen as well as the implication that trolls have been dying this way for generations to keep tension up until the end. Barb is practically screaming for someone to make her a good guy in the second scene with her. Side note, but it also doesn\u2019t help the villain presence when like every single group of assassin bad guys just showed up and turned good immediately.\n\nFollowing that, the ending is literally the same exact thing as the first movie except with less stakes. Kinda hard to redo the concept of the trolls losing what makes them happy when you did it before when the character were staring inevitable death in the face instead of not being able to make music.\n\nThe humor really wasn\u2019t as good as the first either, lot of jokes didn\u2019t land at all for me or were just repeated from the first. I don\u2019t think all the jokes in the first movie landed either but the comedy in this just seemed like it thought the worst jokes in the first movie were the best ones.\n\nAlso weird continuity things? Branches hair isn\u2019t blue anymore? The weird stretchy leg troll that was just like pretending as if we knew who she was? \n\nunenthusiastic have really expected much since I\u2019m an adult who\u2019s really invested in a Trolls movie but I loved the concept and character designs from the trailers of the sequel and I can\u2019t help but be very disappointed after Trolls 1 really subverted my expectations and was way more adult, dark, and funny than I expected. World Tour is innoffensive and a visual treat like the first but it\u2019s just a step in the wrong direction imo.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for writing so much about Trolls, I just love the first one okay. I\u2019m weird.", "It was ok but not great. Something about it just lacks heart to me. It\u2019s all very superficial. The movie shines when it breaks outside the box with the animation like during the funk sequence. Or me Tinkles almost death.", "I thought it was as good as the first. Loved the pinky promise.\n\nMy 6 year old daughter and I watched Trolls 1 yesterday and World Tour today. She liked World Tour more.", "Pleasantly surprised. This was great. \n\nIn a world of \"Ugly Dolls\" and \"Emoji Movie\", it's refreshing to be able to say that someone clearly gave a shit when they made \"Trolls 2\".\n\nIt's so goddamn positive and energetic and the animation is dripping in color just ahhh.. If you're shut in due to quarantines right now or even just feeling down, this movie is a straight shot of positivity to the brain.\n\n**My Verdict:** - 8/10. It's dragged down by some extreme kid-movie clich\u00e9s at almost every turn, but it's such happy eye candy some thing's gotta be wrong with you if you don't smile a bit.", "Thought it was interesting that Ozzy who plays King Thrash gave the horn sign in the film when it was Dio that came up with that and essentially replaced him in Black Sabbath.", "I have no interest in watching the movie, but I need to find clips of the McElroy's scenes asap. I've listened to the podcast since day one, and seeing their scenes is the final piece.", "I have not seen the first movie. Not the tv show if there is one. I think my kid said there is but she's 7 so not super reliable but I trust her on this. \nComing into without knowing anything about it was kind of a mind trip. I felt like I was doing acid at some points. Like the talking hot air balloon. And the Kenny G troll that was practically doing cunnilingus on his sax. The tigers running in out of nowhere. \nAll in all, I was very entertained though most the music isn't my taste. The rock songs all seemed to be redone to be more pop-like and I wish they would have really made the infinity gauntlet story line more of a parody and hit on it a little more. They way they set it up just sorta made it a ripoff.", "When Dickory reveals himself to Poppy, she exclaims \u201cSo you\u2019re the yodelers!\u201d even though nobody has ever mentioned anything about yodelers to her. Unless I missed something...", "It teaches us a message about harmony, togetherness, hope, diversity and communication.

They felt very lackster. I also hated how they never really focused on the similarity shared by all music and made it seem bad that people think Music shares similarities and only should be viewed as different. All music stems from manipulating sound and trying to exact an emotion/feeling in others or oneself. If they focused more on this I think the ending would have been more powerful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also think there should have just been 1 string in the beginning and the string was nothing but sound but over time the trolls began to manipulate that string to create different sounds and give them shape which created the genres.", "I enjoyed it more than the first mainly because the play list was more diverse.", "I didn't like it quite as much as the first one, it's not as rewatchable.   Still very good!  At the very end, Barracuda changed her mind waaay to quick just so they could start the final number.  I missed the Bergens.  (don't miss the end credit scene!)\n\nHaving said that, there were plenty of digs at the music industry and little jokes about various music genres that I loved, something for adults to enjoy. The music was all damn catchy, wasn't a bad song in the bunch.  Loved the little differences between the Troll tribes (Country Trolls landscape being made of folded quilts instead of scrapbooking material for the Pop Trolls for example)\n\nBranch rubbing the eyeballs of everybody to calm everybody down was hilarious. \n\nThe Smooth Jazz Troll and Branch and Poppy's experience with it was hilarious. \n\nAnd my fave Troll Cooper found his Funk Tribe! \n\nBest quote from Branch:  **\"Who\u2019s ready to get rippin\u2019 tattoos everywhere but our faces in case we still need office jobs?\"**", "Has anyone watched on amazon prime?

In one of them, the ghost of a Country troll we see die earlier in the film floats out of his coffin and dances.  Mr. Dinkles jumps in the coffin, and we see him again encountering the God of worms.", "I don't really understand what there is to dislike about this movie. They obviously put a lot of effort in the animation, the message is wholesome (kids will either come out knowing about the different genres of music, or how it's okay to be different), and the voice acting is great. It's really inclusive of age and gender (even showing a male troll giving birth). It's really not a lazy sequel.\n\nI only wish the big song \"Let Me Hear You Sing\" was done in 6 different styles, like make it Country, Pop, Rock, Techno, Classical and Funk one after the other, that would be cool and it would make it more clear that they are celebrating all their styles with equal importance.

She ended up liking all of the trolls, most noticeably the new merfolk. \n\nAs for me and the wife, we liked a lot about it, but we enjoyed the charm of the first movie more. Anna and JT were just as good, though. It's incredibly visually appealing with tons of textures and colors. Poppy is just as cute as ever, especially when she dances. Branch can really get down, too! All of the songs were ironically pop, but that's to be expected in a kids movie. It didn't take us out of it at all. Also kind of funny to note was that one of the themes was pop music ruining everything. We're also the type that enjoys trippy sequences, and there were two good ones with Mr. Dinkles and smooth jazz, lol.\n\nAll in all, enjoy it for what it is and don't over think it.", "Besides being Trolls:infinity war the movie is fairly good.

They had k-pop trolls and yodelling trolls and completely skipped the entire kingdom of techno trolls. I feel cheated and even having George Clinton as one of the ruling characters does not make up for the disproportionate number of country songs that they force you to choke down in order to watch it.", "I thought it was fun and silly! A good kids movie but I laughed at some parts. A little odd that the Kpop trolls are bounty hunters since they're also technically pop music, just in a different language.

The choppiness of the animation or straight up graphical errors, like the flute scene, the cat walk scene with biggie & gang, and a number of other scenes, along with background.

Usually sequels are hit or miss but overall this movie kept me entertained the whole time. There were no unnecessary scenes and it flowed well in my opinion.

As people are saying the title moment was just...incredible.", "That's a quite impressive performance from lead actress Sidney Flanigan, considering she had never acted before.", "Beneath the abortion story, there's a harrowing depiction of how young women are experiencing sex.  Every male character in this movie is kind of a zombified pervert.  Jasper is the only one who shows any brain activity, but even he is just going to great lengths to try to hook up with this girl who will barely talk to him.\n\nIt certainly can be true to life, but it's also like an impressionistic depiction of men from the perspective of someone with the history that Autumn describes to her counselor.  Eventually, you think that every man she meets is going to harass her or harm her in someway.  And then you realize you're feeling what she's feeling, and that makes you appreciate even more what she's been through.", "Really strong debut performances from Sidney Flanigan and Talia Ryder. I honestly think these two girls are going to be movie stars. Talia Ryder is in Spielberg's West Side Story at the end of the year too and I really think she's going to take off. Flanigan gives a really natural performance that doesn't even feel like its acting. She gives the movie this fly on the wall documentary feel that's also aided by the gorilla filmmaking in this that you know they didn't have permits for, especially all those subway scenes.\n\nI think the movie tells an important story, but it all felt very procedural for me a times. Like they take you through the entire abortion process from how I would imagine it exactly goes down. It's emotional, and impactful, but there's an obvious message behind it. The movie is looking to ignite change. A change I believe in, because America, your abortion laws are fucked up, but it also makes the film feel like a Planned Parenthood commercial with high production values. Just saying.\n\nIt's a simple story led by some really strong performances tied together with an important message. Great chemistry between the two leads.

The film was just beautifully shot and I really dug all of the performances. There's the small town crime angle. The sea shanties were a fun little touch, too. Margo Martindale is one of my favorite actors and she doesn't disappoint here.\n\nBut overall, I just didn't like the story. I can kinda see what the filmmakers were going for, but when you get through the first 30 minutes, you have this *buffet* of potential outcomes that I was really interested to see play out... but then nothing really happens.\n\nThe two main characters get abruptly pushed into the background in favor of building up the dealings of the women who had a hand in the B&B and the power struggle at the end.\n\nI thought the conflict between the two sisters was the most interesting part of the film. One wants to stick it out in her hometown, but her sister, who doesn't even want to stay and almost begrudges her dead mother for getting sick in the first place, is making her life increasingly difficult. Wanting to leave instead of fighting to keep the house, going crazy the night of the funeral, killing a dude with a harpoon and a brick, forgetting about the knife at the crime scene, stealing the money, lying to her sister all the while, etc.\n\nBut none of that gets broached in a significant way, there's barely a tiff over it, and then all of their problems are just kinda solved overnight. Literally. It's almost a false climax. Most of the major events happen outside of the sisters' influence. And then they just sorta shrug off all the conflicts. \"If we work hard, we'll be able to keep the house and send you to college, no problem.\"\n\nI dunno, it was entertaining but I'm kinda shocked by the 99% it's getting so far. Also, for being compared to a Coen Brothers film so much, the humor just wasn't there. Overall, I don't think the Fargo comparisons are very apt.\n\nAlso:\n\n> To conceal their crime, the sisters must go deep into the criminal underbelly of their hometown, uncovering the town's darkest secrets.\n\nI feel like this *never* really happened. They just brought the money back.", "It was a fine movie for turning on for background noise.

I know it's not saying much as this was a pretty weak year of movies even before theaters shut down but this is one of my favorites of the year so far.\n\nWhat I liked: I've spent a lot of time in small New England towns. This is a bit farther north than me but it really does a good job capturing that vibe. I also thought the movie did a really good job in capturing the vibe of losing a family member and trying to get by. I think most of the performances are good, I hadn't seen Sophie Lowe in anything before this and she really stood out to me. Margo Martindale was a treat as always. And last I just really like the concept of the movie. Group has to get rid of body, escape with money is something I pretty much always enjoy. \n\nWhat I didn't like: Some of the performances just didn't hold up to the others. Morgan Saylor goes a little too big with the accent for me, and it was kinda distracting. I think the movie is more successful as a tone piece than as a narrative, because the story just doesn't really wrap up in a compelling way. \n\nAll in all I think was good but doesn't really hit the mark of great.

I think the town matriarchs understand exactly the circumstances under which Gorski would have been murdered by one of the Connelly girls. They all grew up dealing with this transient population of outsider men, who behave exactly as Gorski behaved toward Mary Beth (and toward Dee). They condone the idea of 'solving a problem' directly, even if the girls needed help in the coverup. Helping the girls of the town is what they do. \n\nIt's interesting that there's no Connelly father pictured or mentioned. I wonder if the girls were actually the products of rapes,and if the 'for our daughters' line was more than just an abstract concept. If they were the immediate catalyst for the brothel would also explain why the townswomen seem so particularly fond of them.\n\nI appreciated the compassion for the prostitutes, and that they were the ones who \"won\" in the end. I loved the moment with the card. I expected it to be money, or maybe a religious pamphlet or something, but the simple recognition of Alex's grief for her friend was incredibly touching.

I liked how this stayed pretty small and self-contained - in this type of flick eventually the lies and covering them up usually spirals past the point of reality. But that also keeps the movie down a bit, the coen-esque of the start and the set up doesn't continue through. \n\nBut I can't complain - given the choice I would rather it stay small but still interesting, than go bigger and strain the film past the breaking point. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso nice to be woman written, directed, and focused.", "I'm confused why this is listed under comedy honestly.

Were they covering for them?", "So my girlfriend and I were under the impression that this was a series. We watched this with the understanding that this was the first episode and LOVED it. What a great way to open a series!!! The old ladies covering for the girls, what's their history? What awful past was Enid talking about when the ladies were \"on their own\"? The police are onto the girls, how will they get out of it!?\n\nInstead it just fell off. I was half expecting some cult-like underbelly to the town which Enid and the other women built the bed and breakfast to deter, but no. I'm left with the feeling that I just watched a DAMN good pilot to a series that will never be green lit. The cinematography, the music, the acting, the sets, all of it was really great. I'm so let down, man.", "I posted about this film a few months ago, bit of early discussion here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ftrs9q/lets\\_discuss\\_blow\\_the\\_man\\_down\\_2019\\_prime\\_video\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ftrs9q/lets_discuss_blow_the_man_down_2019_prime_video_a/) \n\nThis is a familiar story line - everyday, normal, nonviolent people finding themselves mixed up in a highly unusual, dangerous, illegal situation and having to decide whether to turn themselves in or cover it up. What makes this movie so compelling is the slow reveal of the small town's history and dynamics - specifically the not-so-secret brothel run by Enid and the surprising amount of influence of the town matriarchs, Susie, Doreen, and Gail. It's these 4 women, plus Priscilla and Mary Beth's mother (who although is dead, is discussed so often, it's clear what a major player she was) who both create the original conditions leading to this violent situation and (except for Enid) try their best to dismantle it.\n\nWhen you originally meet Susie, Doreen, and Gail, they seem like a fussy bunch who are perhaps too conservative and concerned with the appearance of respectability to approve of a brothel operating in their town. However, as the film continues, we learn that these women were instrumental to establishing this brothel decades ago (for reasons we'll explore soon). However long they supported its functions in the past, the drugs and violence surrounding it were becoming too dangerous, and after prostitute Dee was found murdered, they try to convince (and later threaten) Enid to close it.\n\nThe most compelling part of this film for me was the fact that this brothel was started by women to protect women in the town from the sexual violence by the town's visitors - rapist sailors, basically. This is alluded to several times by the women along the lines of, \"You don't know how bad it used to be\"; \"We all have our stories\"; \"You should be grateful\"; \"If it's not Enid's girls, then it's our own daughters\"; \"We found a way to manage the situation\". I have never seen this type of reasoning for starting a brothel in films before - or even in real life sex work discourse, really. Often in film, we see madames and prostitutes explain their decision to start sex work as mostly economical, especially in male-heavy locales. It is simply the most lucrative work for women in that time or place. But these women don\u2019t start a brothel for simple financial gain - they literally use it as community risk mitigation and a tool for crime reduction. Presumably, Enid\u2019s workers act as an outlet for the sexual cravings of sailors who would otherwise rape the townswomen.\n\nThere is a lot to be unpacked here. For example, the burden of reducing sexual violence fell on the townswomen, who chose to open a brothel as some sort of sexual buffer, rather than the lawmakers/elected officials/police, who really should be more concerned with reducing sexual violence in their town. We see virtually 0 men in these traditional positions of power in this film, aside from Offer Coletti (who is far too charmed by the brothel\u2019s services to be a useful law enforcer in any way), and Officer Brennan (who is trying his best, despite his greenness). The real power players here are the 4 older women, who are a couple steps ahead of the police at all times. Another thing to consider is while these women are generally warm and welcoming to the prostitute Alexis, sometime long ago they decided that there would be a group of women who would bear the brunt of the sailor problem in order to keep the rest of the townswomen untouched. What types of extra protections and gratitudes are offered to these women, or are they simply categorized as low-level, less important women? I\u2019m not saying that the 4 are literally picking who works for Enid - we assume that all her employees are consenting and paid individuals. But since they are acting as vital buffers for the predatory behaviors of visiting men (in the eyes of the 4 women), are they being appreciated as such, or seen more as collateral damage?\n\nThat ending! That sweet ol lady smile! Here I have actual confusion. It\u2019s clear that Susie, Doreen, and Gail dispose of Gorski\u2019s body so that the police do not investigate his death. What I don\u2019t fully understand is why. Did they 1) recognize that this was the handiwork of Priscilla and Mary Beth - if so, how? Did they recognize their cooler? - and decide to protect them? Or 2)Did they recognize a chopped up Gorski and decide that anyone who killed this creepy, rapey murderer did a good thing and should be left alone? I loved this ending - a true testament to sisterhood and women taking care of their own - but it\u2019s still unclear to me.", "Finally a movie about my favorite Sea Shanty from Black Flag.\n\nLegitimately glad this subreddit got this movie on my radar.

Why would they not show her face and then act like it\u2019s a revelation when they do?", "SPOILERS\n\n3 things that shined in this movie, that weren't just funny or effective but actually legit social commentary:\n\n(1) The basic plotline about this being the first hunt; I love the idea that there are pizza-gate level right-wing idiots who instantly believe that, of course, Davos-attending liberal elites totally hunt working class whites for fun.....and that THAT'S what actually sends a circle of psychopathic liberal elites, who would previously had not considered actually doing such a thing, to actually do it.  That's more edgy than the premise most of us thought it was going to be, that manor-gate had been a thing for awhile, and this is just the time it backfires.  That's the typical most-dangerous-game premise.  There's commentary against both sides there; yes, the murderers are the bad guys, but the credulous right-wing trolls who daily claim that they WANT a civil war, bring it on!  Lefties are all satantic child rapists who want white genocide!!  Yeah, it's a pretty solid swipe at them, too...\n\n(2) The real Crystal McCready.  I don't think we're supposed to accept that scene at face value.  I think that Athena DID find the real Crystal McCready.  Notice how Crystal looks deeply wounded and angry, not confused, when Athena is talking about her dad and mom.  Her acting when she corrected her, \"There's a second Crystal, spells it with an E; I get her mail sometimes,\" it kinda sounds like she's making it up.  Their last exchange - \"Are you Justice4all?  We're both dead.  Just tell me.\"  \"No, Ma'am, I'm not.\"  I LOVE IT!  I see it as a meta moment about judging each other as our hastag personas; Crystal is saying, \"No, I am not that thing that you think I am; I am not my biography; I am not that hashtag.  You got ME wrong.\"  Overall, you can see it  both ways.  I like that ambiguity.  \n\n(3) Hillary Swank catching the 250k champagne like a clutch touchdown dive.

The first half hour of \u201cswitch the main character\u201d was a new way to do it for me, but I enjoyed the movie for the kills and the simple parody-comedy.\nIt was definitely weird having them \u201chide\u201d Hilary Swank\u2019s face until like an hour into the movie, though. Not sure what that was about but she seemed to have fun with the role. Her kitchen fight with Gilpin was pretty good, honestly.", "I had a blast at this. I'm probably one of those liberal elites (from the south, no less) they spend half the time poking fun at, but everyone was so exaggerated that I didn't care. Gilpin was excellent, the physical comedy was great. Little touches, like when she tries to swing away using that decorative rope thingie, and instead of it being a heroic escape, it holds up about as well as any piece of art not designed to be swung from and she crashes down.

Like Crystal's expression when she sees that the pack of cigarettes cost $9. Or when the one hunter pulls the mag out of her gun and doesn't realize that there's one in the chamber (on the other hand, when Crystal drops her gun in the mailbox she removed the magazine but doesn't clear the chamber...

Asks the attendant what state shes in, attendant says Arkansas. Hunted hands attendant $20, attendant hands back cigs and $10 bill + coins. Hunted immediately jumps over counter, knocks out attendant female, pulls sawed off shotgun from under the counter, screams \"cigarettes in Arkansas are 6.75!

I don't understand people saying it's too preachy, for me it came off as a comedy making fun of how preachy we (and liberal Hollywood) can be.

It's just really funny to me, like self-deprecating liberal humor.\n\nI also understand where the villain was coming from. They got branded as people-killer and lost their jobs over it, so it was like \"now that we were already punished for the crime, we might as well do it\". At least that's how she sees it in her head. Like \"oh you called me a homicidal maniac, well I'll be a homicidal maniac, it's your fault\". I see the comedy in that, like how crazy we get over internet comments. And the conversation where Crystal is like \"but you are doing it though\", and Athena saying \"but I wasn't before though\". I get that, as crazy as it is.\n\nFinally I loved the subversiveness at the start with the inexperienced pretty girl thrown in the situation that we think we'll be rooting for, and then the hot guy who acts heroic that we think will be the lead, and we only find out later who's the lead.", "All I could think throughout was how Betty Gilpin would be a great choice to play The Joker at some point", "Awesome female lead!

If Don really was a victim and Athena was trying to just make it look like he was bad, why wouldn't he drop his gun?

It bordered on being a little cringy at times but they mostly kept it dialed back enough. There's plenty for people on either team to get really pissed about, which I can get behind. The gunplay was actually pretty good, I just watched Invisible Man and got unreasonably angry at a character cocking their gun when it already would have been cocked, so none of that sort of thing here that I noticed.

A great character that didn't need more than a line or two of dialogue to flesh out.\n\nThe movie was kind of interesting from a structural standpoint. You didn't know who was important since everyone kept getting killed off, and there was real tension for a while as a result. The flashback to reveal the backstory was a bit heavy handed but worked because Hillary Swank is so good.\n\nThe political stuff wasn't as bad as I thought, they kind of gave it to both sides.

Wasn't expecting Emma Roberts to get killed off so soon.\n\nMy question is, do you think Crystal was honest when she said that she wasn't the person they were looking for?

They end up doing a \"both sides are bad\" message that feels like a South Park episode, rather than a meaningful social commentary. It got there near the end, but before that it was just caricatures. I didn't get offended and some of it made me laugh, but a lot of it fell flat for me. They just took it too far.

Holy shit.", "I really liked The Hunt. A lotta people seem to be knocking it, taking away from it that it just takes shots at both sides, left and right, that everyone is awful etc. But I don\u2019t think the point of the film was to say anything particularly insightful about either liberals or conservatives, it more about the dangers of misinformation in general, and applies these dangers to the current political climate in America in a purposefully absurdist fashion. A visceral depiction of how America\u2019s in danger of eating itself alive due to misinformation rampant on social media and from the White House (kinda timely with all the downplaying of the coronavirus in the last week). But still within the confines of a last-person-standing sorta thriller movie. The film isn\u2019t subtle about this but it\u2019s a lot of fun, Betty Gilpin is amazing, couple of forgivable misplaced lines here and there but overall I thought it was a really good film.\n\nIf it hadn\u2019t been all hyped up by the media - and eventually Blumhouse too - as just red vs blue, it maybe wouldn\u2019t have got the kicking it\u2019s been getting.", "Pretty... basic? Doesn't really parody the left and right so much as shallow caricatures of American right wingers and comically woke center right liberals. The rich \"elites\" of the film are portrayed as wealthy CEO types. You can't really be a leftist CEO. You can be a liberal CEO. But even liberal CEOs are not likely \"woke liberals\" as portrayed in the film. I doubt CEOs would ever talk about \"POCs\" and privilege and appropriation in private. As a parody of typical American liberals, it's somewhat entertaining just because of the novelty. There hasn't really been a lot of mainstream media making fun of current day liberals (i.e. jokes about woke stuff, there's been plenty of jokes made in the past about hybrid cars and shit, but that's all dated now). But aside from the novelty of it, the jokes aren't really smart or cutting. There's no fresh insight. \n\nNothing new or interesting with the conservative characters either. One of them says \"Snowflake\" at one point. They say phrases like \"rich liberal elites\". That's as deep as it goes. Not a lot of effort put in.\n\nI've seen a few reviewers praise Betty Gilpin's performance. I disagree. Thought it was pretty embarrassing. The accent seemed hokey, and it looked like she was making some weird face much of the movie. Even if the acting was perfect however, the character is still poorly written. Very corny and trying way too hard to be cool. Comes across as if she barely even cares that she's been kidnapped. I guess she somehow learned how to do all this John Wick shit while working as a file clerk or something in Afghanistan. And having her turn out to have been kidnapped by mistake seems like a lame choice. It's fine if the protagonist isn't completely sympathetic to the entire audience. Even if she were a conspiracy obsessed right winger, she'd still be way better than the people she's killing, because the antagonists are literally hunting human beings for sport because they're mad that they got \"cancelled\". \n\nReally just a limp attempt at satire. But since I've got Regal Unlimited, I don't regret seeing it. If I'd paid like nine dollars for a ticket I'd be disappointed. Since it only cost 55 cents, I was mildly entertained for an hour and a half just seeing how things would pan out. It's an inoffensive, okayish action movie.", "I really enjoyed it. Had me laughing throughout. The fact that everyone was just as political charged as twitter was great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I thought they were gonna do a reveal that our main character was trans.

She seemed to pause before yanking into the cart with a heap of power behind it. Her fight scene at the end had a lot of big throws around too. So I thought it was gonna be a big reveal to show they chose someone \"progressive\" and would have a dilemma on their hands. Thought it would be a humours twist. But Nothing came of it.

Not so much in the quality department as I felt the fights and dialogue had a lot to be desired, but it wasn't what it seemed at first so at least it wasn't boring?\n\nThe first part of the movie I was actually making a list of clich\u00e9s in my head this movie was abusing. Loose cannon kill machine, hot wife with the personality depth of a puddle, eccentric villain kills wife for truly no reason, loose cannon survives and becomes RoboCop. \n\nThis is all, of course, in service of the big twist which is that the man that made him keeps altering his memories to make him an assassination machine thinking he's avenging his dead wife. The movie even goes so far as to say out loud that it used every clich\u00e9 in the book for his backstory. Thought that was really fun and it all made me just sit back and enjoy the ride. \n\nBut even then, the ride isn't totally enjoyable. Because of the cyclical aspect of the plot the pacing was really off. It was all just sequences of him going to kill someone. Which is fine, but also not really *that* interesting. And while it could have been spiced up with some dumb fun, instead it took itself so seriously. \n\nI was also disappointed in the use of his powers. The first assassination he was basically God. He could be his own guy in the chair and look up info, he could Neo/Matrix himself knowledge, he could control lights in the tunnel. So that was a cool scene, but from then on he didn't use any of that. He just punched really hard. \n\nLaMorne was probably the standout for me. I think the movie got immediately better when he showed up, and if they did a sequel with him and Vin and the lady I'd honestly go watch it. But the lack of interesting action and the painful dialogue made this a movie I'd probably not watch again. Not even the twist lent itself any rewatchability. \n\n5/10.

But not as good as their based on true stories movies.\n\nThe story was fairly predictable. I knew who that Wahlberg's ex-partner was the main villain almost immediately after he got out of jail. I would have been better if it amounted to something more than corrupt cops trying to buy into a casino. A casino which you don't even find out until over an hour into the movie. Could've used maybe a flashback scene showing why its important for Spenser to solve the case. He pretty much watches the news announcing that an old cop he knew killed himself and he goes \"No way! I kinda knew that guy. He wouldn't do that!\" and he starts working the case.\n\nBut it was still a fun movie. I liked Wahlberg as this guy ex-boxer who keeps getting his ass whipped.

He carries himself like a bad ass and you think in this type of movie he is going to be able to beat up 3-4 guys at once like Denzel in his action movies.

Other than getting the license plate he doesn't really do anything pivotal in solving the case. I did like the whole \"so he killed a cat?\" scene where he slices up the tracksuits car.

They replaced the original smart, wisecracking Spenser with a nearly mindless young goon. They replaced Hawk with a guy who not only wasn't a stone-cold killer, he couldn't even fight properly, and he wasn't an ultra-smooth ladies man, just a mndless goon like Spenser.!<\n\n>!And Susan is transformed from a psychiatrist to a dog groomer.!< I shit you not.\n\nSo I figured it had to be a parody. They were going to do some mocking of the original series, good-natured or otherwise. But for it to have been a parody, there should have been some funny stuff. But there was next to no funny stuff in this movie. It was too stupid to be funny. \n\nInstead they took every bit of the wit and humor and bravado that made the original Spenser fun and replaced it with a generic cop melodrama, exchanging humor for fistfights and schmaltz.\n\nMost of the acting was well above the level that was required by the script, not that the acting was Oscar-level or anything, it was competent to very good, but none of the actors had a hell of a lot to work with, given the script. The only standout was Iliza Schlesinger as Spenser's dog-grooming love interest, she was miles beyond what her role called for, lighting up the movie whenever she was onscreen.\n\nThe people who made this film probably had hopes of getting a franchise going here, but they will only be remembered as the idiots who screwed up one of America's best private eye characters, the American equivalent of all the schmucks who've screwed up Sherlock Holmes in various ways. \n\nDo not waste your time. I'm a huge Spenser fan, I had to know, and I'm sorry I took the time to find out.", "Honestly was expecting way worse based on the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

Had some good lines, \u201cdid you just kick me, bro?\u201d Wasn\u2019t sure why Hawk ended up in the hospital in the end though.", "Clearly someone found a lost Steven Seagal script from the late 80s.", "This was not great, mediocre at best, but watchable in a paint by number, traditional broadcast TV movie kind of way, which is what I think they were going for. Very much a second screen kind of watch, but interesting in that it's essentially a TV procedural as an action movie. \n\nThe plot was basic, but they would have been better off making the criminals' scheme less convoluted, it's got about 10-15 minutes of fat, and they went a too heavy on the action and didn't lean enough on the investigative/detective elements. The performances are ok if you're thinking of this not as a big time feature film, but as a TV movie, though you can definitely tell they didn't do many takes and it was likely a brisk production. There are some fairly wooden performances and some really tough dialogue, but since it's basically a B movie you can't fault it too much. \n\nOverall, I'd say that this is a movie for people who really like old crime shows or enjoy CBS style procedurals who want something with a slightly harder edge and don't want anything too challenging. If I were to compare it to something recent, I would say it's like a direct to Netflix, TV movie version of the Denzel Equalizer movies. If those are like a B grade adaptation of an old crime TV show into a movie series, I would say this was probably a C- on that scale, though it's mostly because I like several of the principals, and you could easily talk me into a D as a standalone feature but it looks like they plan on more. \n\nSince it seems like they expect to do a series of these, which is a good idea, I do think that this movie functions fairly well as an introduction to these basic characters, and if they can crank these out like once every year, or even more often, and they can keep the shoots to 15-20 days I could see this being a good investment for Netflix. I could even see a BBC Sherlock type of format where there are a few feature length procedural \"episodes\" shot and released in batches every few years. If it were to retain this model, I'd keep up with this as kind of guilty pleasure comfort food as long as they maintained the cast and slightly improved the writing.

Which isn't surprising since O'Connor took that approach in Miracle.\n\nNow, as for my theater experience. I had a woman in her 60s-70s who absolutely would not shut the fuck up. Every crack of beer was met with a \"shit!\" or \"Jeezus!\" And any emotional moment was met with \"Oooh\" or \"awww\". I wanted to say something to tell her to stop, but it wasn't technically talking it was random outbursts of 1 or 2 words. She also brought a goddamn feast for herself with BBQ wings and popcorn. And she had a clear plastic cup that she would hold up to the heavens like a priest blessing the wine at Church. I assume to see where the liquid level was? Which don't know why that matters?

It is nowhere near \u2018Warrior\u2019 good.", "Spoilers below\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Way Back is not the movie I thought I was going to see, but that was ok.  This movie really focused more on alcohol addiction than basketball.  Ben Affleck did a really good job and reminded me why I've enjoyed a lot of his portrayals.  The movie was really predictable until the final act and at one point I thought the movie was over after the big game that was portrayed.  I actually enjoyed the final act and how you could see that the team was basically his crutch and he needed to find inner peace over the death of his son in order for him to really heal and move on.  Overall I'd give this film a 8/10.", "I really enjoyed this. Affleck gives the performance of his career but I have to admit I would've liked to spend a little more time with the team.", "I really enjoyed this movie. I know it's not perfect but it really hit the right notes for me.\n\n\\- Ben Affleck carried the entire movie. Amazing performance. Very sobering, very realistic, and absolutely wrenching. We all felt his highs and lows.\n\n\\- Basketball scenes were pretty gripping. I know some people were criticizing not knowing enough about the players, but I thought it was just enough. And the dialogue was indeed very realistic.\n\n\\- It embraces the cliches but elevates it with pure emotional resonance and wore everything on its sleeves.\n\n\\- Most importantly, thematically, the way that this idea that we have to work on fixing ourselves first before we can help others, and you not realizing how much you are impacting others in both good and bad ways, but mostly in good ways by the end, is such a powerful message. Some people said that this movie felt like 2 movies but I disagree. I think that this movie really connects his alcoholism with the coaching extremely well. He can move on from his grief and do good with the kids, but then one look at a sick kid in the hospital and he's relapsing. It's realistic and sad but it's the truth.\n\nThe coaching is his way back, and he couldn't quite get there unfortunately, but once he works on himself by going to therapy and finally helping himself (by the way, that scene where he talks with his ex wife absolutely killed me), he can positively impact others and finally get better.\n\nI love this movie.

It will have you contemplating your life, and the decisions you\u2019ve made. Touches on our fears, our regrets, and the damage these can do. It hits every emotion in your body and it does not let up. I found myself actively rooting for the characters, especially Jack (Affleck). This is not a basketball movie, although the sport definitely holds an important role throughout the film. Lovers of the sport can appreciate it, but this movie is a treat for anyone that enjoys great film making and impeccable acting.", "Honestly was severely disappointed with the film. I was really excited for it after the first trailer dropped, but I feel like the ending product was held up solely because of Affleck\u2019s performance. The film around him just felt kind of empty, if that makes sense? Based off of the trailers, and \u2018Warrior\u2019, I was expecting something more emotionally charged and moving, but I ended up feeling as if I was just watching a sequence of events, with little to no emotional resonance, which sucks because of how personal the story was to Affleck. I would have loved to see him tackle his issues with addiction in a more emotionally transparent and charged film. \u2018The Way Back\u2019 wasn\u2019t a bad film by any means, but I found it rather forgettable.", "Run of the mill story but damn Affleck was fantastic.", "affleck was excellent. wonderful score. very similar to a lot of gavin o\u2019connor films - they touch on all the familiar beats, and are sometimes outrageously cliche, yet are done effectively and relatably. \n\nit\u2019s not warrior, hell, not even miracle, but it\u2019s worth watching. that beautiful final shot of him balling on the waterfront was the perfect ending.", "A bit melodramatic in places but very good overall.

When it wasn't a cliche, but effective, sports movie it was a heavy character-driven drama led by Affleck's performance. I like both parts of it, but I don't feel like it ever completely melded together. \n\nI tend to enjoy Affleck movies and this was no exception, but it will probably go down in the same vein as The Accountant. Meaning it's film I enjoyed, but ultimately will sort of forget within the next few months.", "Definitely was not expecting this movie to actually be good lmao. Affleck, while not my favorite actor of his generation, has really proven to have much more staying power than I originally imagined. I think his openness and vulnerability is a big part of that. He feels much more authentic than most celebrities.", "Really solid until the third act. Needed some more meat there. It wrapped up really quick", "The score of this movie is fucking fantastic. The last time I left a movie talking about the score was Friday Night Lights 15+ years ago.", "Beautiful piece of cinema. The third act seemed short, but still sweet; a healthy reminder to myself and others that film doesn't need to adhere to traditional storytelling tropes. \n\nAs a composer, this is the type of film I dream of working on, its written and edited so there's so much space to breathe and digest the information provided through the visuals. Instead of just action cues or traditional music between scenes, it invited an oppertunity for blissful elevation. Rob Simonsen seized this oppertunity and created a prominently pleasurable score.", "I really enjoyed this film (been looking forward to it ever since the Bon Iver trailer!) and, like all the other commenters here, loved Affleck\u2019s performance. I would\u2019ve liked a little more emotion at points, although I did love the final shot of him shooting hoops. I also really liked the music (especially in the first act), it felt understated but helped to amplify Affleck's performance.\n\n\nOne thing I was a little confused by was the use of slow zooms throughout the film, I felt like it took me out of the moment a bit and reminded me I was watching a movie.

Not everything blows up like we see in a lot of drama. \n\nAlways have been a fan of Affleck, I saw Good Will Hunting when I was young and it was right when I was getting into movies, so I always root for him.

The movie needed to be either 20 minutes longer, or have 20 minutes cut from elsewhere and 20 minutes of recovery added.\n\nWith less than 20 minutes left in the movie the protagonist is hit with the consequences of his actions and there's little written to show his punishment or recovery from those actions.\n\nAll in all it's a good, sound movie that got the fundamentals right. The movie made you care for the protagonist and their goals, but in the end there was little resolve of conflict. I'd give it a 6.5/10. Worth the time to watch, the acting is good. The portrayal of high schoolers is good. There's good ideas there. It just fails to end in a satisfying way.", "Easily the best performance of the year so far.

It was an enjoyable movie and my husband and I laughed out loud several times. I had full on tears rolling down my face at the end, which I love in all honesty. Please movies make me feel all the feels! It was a lovely movie of self discovery of two brothers and their amazing mom who all helped make each other who they are. The mom character was phenomenal and noteworthy, as it is common in Disney history for the mom to be deceased and the dad is the sole parent present. Having had a single mom raise me and my 3 brothers it was nice to see that shown in a movie. Plus to show such a strong and supportive mother in that role who was not just a mom but a more developed person. I really appreciated how they approached that. \n\nOne thing I noticed (and my husband missed, so I thought I\u2019d mention it in case anyone else did as well...but it in no way was a hidden thing) was how even though Ian was the magic one  it was ultimately his fault the spell didn\u2019t work because he didn\u2019t trust his brother to not mess it up. As shown in the final spell when the force of the Stone was pushing him off the landing, it was his brothers strength and support holding him up that allowed him to finish casting the spell. He originally rejected that help in his bedroom the first round, which cause the spell to go haywire and waste the original crystal and result in only their fathers legs. This fact also made the fact that he sacrificed his own time with his father so his brother could say his goodbyes more justifiable in my mind.  \nOverall I really enjoyed this movie and am happy I saw it in theatres..although I did miss a cool Pixar credit scene.

Now, I don't think it's the best Pixar film, that goes to Coco in my opinion, but honestly it's probably somewhere in my top 5.\n\nThere is a lot I love about this movie, but I'll start with the obvious: the emotion. This was such an emotional adventure to watch. It's a bit difficult to get me to tear up, but this movie managed to do it a lot, not just at the end. At the beginning, the middle and all throughout.\n\nI loved the characters Ian and Barley. I really liked that Barley wasn't just the stupid one as the trailers made him seem. He really was crucial to the adventure. Each character felt necessary. Barley wasn't just there for comedic relief, which I enjoyed that aspect as well, but he was essential for Ian and the journey he was on and the reverse was also true. I also really found Ian in particular very relatable. I know from personal experience, as we all do I'm sure, the struggle it is to find confidence in yourself and who you are.\n\nThe brilliance of this movie, IMO, is in the way the story is crafted. It convinces you, you're watching a movie about a quest to meet their father, but then you realize during the checklist scene this is a movie about two brothers realizing the important part they play in each other's lives. It's about how we need to not dwell on what we've lost, but those who we do have and have been there the whole time. I find it interesting how the audience never really meets the father, we see Barley hug him from a far, but the story ultimately wasn't about reuniting the brothers with their dad.\n\nThere isn't really anything I don't like about this movie. The voice work from Chris Pratt and Tom Holland was top notch. Overall I think this movie shows that Pixar's biggest strength is original content. I've liked most sequels as well, but this gets me excited that they are focusing more on original stories. Rating 10/10 for me.", "Tom Holland keeps getting trapped in a pile of rocks!", "Man, I seem to be in the minority here, but I actually think this will be ranked among my favorite Pixar films. I keep trying to think of reasons to dislike it, but honestly, none of them really stand out as important. It's not the best Pixar film, no, but it's enjoyable and emotional all the way through. \n\nI loved the D&D references (gelatinous cube!), I loved the setting, and I loved how the characters interacted. I could totally watch more movies in this universe. There were predictable moments, sure, but I was entertained throughout, and I never once looked at my watch to see how long the movie had been going on. Some of the jokes didn't land (some felt a little too obvious), but the more subtle ones did. \n\nAlso, as a sidenote, you know what I really enjoy? I love how movies today seem to moving more and more away from the typical high school bullying storylines and more towards portraying kids just needing to find a group to fit in with. Ian was shown to be more of a loner, with nobody coming to his birthday party, but it wasn't because people didn't like him or were mean to him. They just didn't know him, and they totally would have come.", "The vans tires popping, causing the damned thing to gallop to its death was pure gold.\n\nOn a more serious note, this movie made me feel.  My roomie and I watched it, and he went through a very similar situation as the older brother (remembers his dad but his little brother barely does).  So he definitely felt it.  For me I related to the Ian and the brotherhood the two boys had.  The movie had me about tearing up several times towards the end and that is a nearly impossible feat.  I really loved this movie.\n\nI wonder how this movie will appeal to kids though.  Writing-wise it felt sorta like an story in an 80\u2019s adventure movie and other than the smart phone I feel like the could have set this decades ago.  This felt like a Pixar movie aimed at an older audience with themes that would connect better with an older audience.  Here in San Antonio with the virus scare going on, just about all the theaters on fandango we\u2019re dead and my roomie and I had the pick of the litter as far as seats go, so I\u2019m hoping that isn\u2019t representative of theater turnout on a larger scale.  This is a movie that deserves to be seen.\n\nAlso it was a huge twist not having the boy even meet his father.  Im wracking my brain to think of stories that went a similar route.  long quest to see someone only to give up the chance to see them so that someone else can.  Or on a broader scale, long quest you undertake for personal reasons that ends in you forfeiting tour end goal so that someone else can have it.  I feel like when it comes to looking for a family member though, there\u2019s always a payoff other than maybe... Speed Racer?  Kinda sorta?\n\nAnyway I encourage everyone to go out to see it.

Not just the emotional ending, but scenes like Ian sitting on his bed saddened when he thinks the spell fails, or the foot tapping scene when they realize it\u2019s really him, or Barley revealing his last memory of their dad. I\u2019d give anything to have my dad back for a day and to get to know him as an adult and not just as a kid whose memories are fading, but even more I\u2019d want him to get to see my brother again. To meet his wife and kids and see the amazing father he has become himself. Amazing themes in this movie, and it has some of Pixar\u2019s most honest and real emotional scenes. I\u2019m crying again right now just thinking and writing about it, and it got plenty of tears out of me in the theater as well.", "I know this is an unpopular opinion but this is probably my new favorite Pixar movie. The fantasy elements mixed with the modern world is perfectly and hilariously bizarre and the film is obviously very personal to the director. I sobbed a whole lot because the main characters are exactly like me and my older sister.", "Saw this last week, and enjoyed it. Was pleasantly surprised by the Simpsons short in front of the film. Never thought I'd see a Simpsons short in front of a Disney film, let alone Pixar. Overall the film was good, very sweet story of brothers. Had a feeling Ian wouldn't get to meet his father, and that he'd realize Barley was the \"dad\" he never had. Barley's 4th memory was pretty heartbreaking, and I'm glad he got his closure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith magic being remembered/used more in this world, I wouldn't mind seeing something on D+ showing it off...this world is like Bright without humans", "I liked that a lot more than I expected, based on reviews I\u2019d seen. \n\nI think, taken altogether, I can see why the overall movie isn\u2019t considered the very best of Pixar. However, the specific character arcs of the brothers, with Ian\u2019s realization and the final resolution of their quest... that\u2019s top tier Pixar for me. \n\nAlso, I loved the way Pixar did magic in this movie. Felt very fun, whimsical, and powerful. Ian\u2019s fight scene at the end was great", "I practically died when Bronco rode off with his hair flowing in the wind.\n\nEdit: I also really liked that the rock dragon sounded like metal being scrapped on concrete.", "It\u2019s so nice to see Dad from Cow and Chicken in a leading role again.", "That ending was really unique and powerful, the way he doesn't get to see his father AND the fucking awesome school dragon", "Rise to Valhalla playing as the van charged into battle. \n\nPops a tire so it starts galloping \n\nAnd then the tickets explode out giving the van wings. \n\nFreakin hysterical but also... oddly moving?", "I liked how Barley had a Phoenix on his back. He was the true gem.", "I lost my Dad when I was 4 from cancer. When Barley said he didn't want to say goodbye to his Dad when he was hooked up to all of those tubes hit me so hard as the same thing happened to me. It was the last day of my Dad's viewing and we were getting ready to leave. My older cousin went up to me and told me to give my Dad a kiss goodbye as I wasn't going to see him again for a really long time. I went up to my father's casket, and I couldn't give him a kiss goodbye as my 4-year-old self did not want to kiss a dead body. I remember going home that night and feeling so down on myself for not giving my Dad that goodbye kiss. It was my first funeral that I had to go through so I had no idea how the events for the next day would play out so I went to bed thinking I would never see my Dad again. The next day, when we get to the church before the burial, I see that the casket was open. The very first thing I did was run straight to casket and give my Dad the biggest kiss I could possibly give him and I said goodbye. \n\nSeeing Barley being able to redeem himself in his mind and get that final goodbye in just hit on another level for me.", "Just finished the movie and damn, I cried to be honest. I'm a 28 year old man, and this movie got me. \n\nIf you had siblings, you could easily empathize with Onward whether your parents are still alive or not. Like the movie, our life and our relationship with siblings are not perfect, but as a family, we have each other's back all the time like Ian and Barley. This movie made me thank my sister again and I really want to watch this again with her.", "I loved how supportive and truly happy Barley was about Ian having magic in him. I mean, Barley believed in this stuff and probably wanted it for himself, and knowing his own brother had it. He was so supportive. My heart swelled.", "This is on the Wall-E, Up, and Inside Out side of the Pixar Spectrum \n\nNot the Cars, Incredibles 2, or Good dinosaur side", "I'm still crying omfg. The end scene on the rocks where he's watching his brother interact with the dad and he sacrificed himself for that moment... fuck my eyes.", "Wow. Just finished watching this on Disney+ and I have to say I\u2019m really blown away. I\u2019m about 11 years older than my brother and neither of us have a relationship with our fathers so I\u2019ve always felt a sense of responsibility towards him. This film perfectly captured how I feel our relationship is and I cannot stress enough when it dawned on me what this film is really about, I just about cried my eyes out. Well done, Pixar.", "Fuck man I did not expect this movie to hit me so hard. I lost my Mom when I was a kid and idk the ending just made me so emotional. The way Ian gave up his time with Dad so the older brother could spend time with his Dad... idk it just really resonated with me more than any other Pixar movie ever has.", "As a big brother, this absolutely crushed me.\n\nI am so scared of my little brother growing to see me as a screw up. He is my world. \n\nWhen he talked about the seeing his father sick, it reminded me of my grandfather before he passed away almost a year ago on Holy Week. I got to say goodbye, but it still was so hard to see him like that.\n\nWhat a great freaking movie.", "This movie was really great. I can\u2019t help but feel for Ian at the end. \n\nMy dad died while my mom was pregnant with me, so immediately finding out that Ian was in a similar situation had me in tears. I\u2019ve always said that if I could have one wish, it would be to have just one memory with my dad, even just a moment. So while I do love the brotherly love story, I do feel so hurt for Ian for not getting that moment that I KNOW is all he\u2019s ever hoped for. (I know this is a kid\u2019s movie, but damn, it hit me straight where it hurts). I also feel proud of him for realizing who he does have. \n\nAlso, props to one of the best movie moms! She reminded me so much of my own mom, who I know would move mountains to give me that moment. In the end, she also lets Barley have his special moment, even though I\u2019m sure she also would love to see her husband one last time. \n\nAgain, great movie. For my personal reasons, I hate the end, because I wanted to live through Ian. I was hoping he somehow got an extra 24 hours since half of him wasn\u2019t there lol. But still solid!", "Wow. I completely understand why some people might not like this movie as much as the other, but this is my favorite Pixar movie. My father died when I was 3 and I have no memories of him, but my older brothers have a few. Needless to say this was a very relatable movie. I remember desperately wanting to know my father. I watched the one home movie we had of him many times, I also wore his clothes as soon as I could fit into them, and even stitched them up when they got holes in them. \n\nThat ending was so good. When Ian decided to let his brother see his father instead of himself, I realized I would have done the same thing. That realization meant a lot to me and helped me contextualize some thoughts I\u2019ve had about my brothers and I, because my father also died with tubes in him (cancer) and they had to say goodbye in that situation.", "I just watched this movie with my wife and it utterly decimated me.\n\nEven my wife who isn\u2019t a fan of the fantasy genre thought it was an excellent movie.\n\nI think it partially wrecked me because the characters were so relatable. My own father has some pretty severe dementia and I never really got to say goodbye while he was still himself. I am also a relatively new father myself, and without going into a lot of detail, this movie really tore about with a lot of different emotions in me.\n\nThe storytelling and details were also really spot on.", "A lot of people in the thread saying this is good but b-tier for Pixar....\n\nBut why?  I thought it was heartfelt, funny, and based around a very unique and clever premise.", "Apparently it\u2019s never a good idea to get sick and then rely on Chris Pratt.", "Loved it.  Made me want to hug my brother, thinking about how he very subtly helped raise me after my parents got a divorce.  He and I had a ton of friction going up (he is 4 years older than me and a jock where I was a nerd) but he protected me and nurtured me in his own goofball way.", "I think I cried harder than I did with Inside Out. Absolutely loved this movie.", "Overall I liked it. Not as strong as Pixar\u2019s other movies but it\u2019s fun and was really emotional at times, especially the ending. Chris Pratt and Octavia Spencer were the two big standouts for me as far as the cast goes.", "I was sort of back and forth before >!Put it in O!!!!< but was on board from there on out and enjoyed it a lot. It seemed to break out of predictability around then. \n\nLiked the shot of LOTR-style journeying with the jet flying overhead.", "I absolutely loved this movie. I related so much to it. My Dad died when I was 8 months old and I never had the chance to know him. My older brother has a handful of memories of him that he's always shared with me. It felt like the whole movie was my story. I had to sit in the theater for about 5 minutes afterwards to try and stop crying. This Thursday I'm taking my Mom and Brother to go see it. I'm really hoping the like it as much as I did.", "Just saw it on Disney+. That was WAY better than I was expecting. It was a simple story but it honestly worked well for what it was setting out to do. I related too much with that awkward teenage stuff at the beginning lmao. I'd place this on the same level of Monster's University (The director's other Pixar film funnily enough) where you either write it off, or really, REALLY like it depending on how well you relate to the film. Me personally, I didn't cry or anything, but I'll admit I got emotional. Especially since my own sister has helped build me up into a better, more confident person than I used to be (And has honestly been a better mom to me than my own mom.)\n\n\nIt ABSOLUTELY won't be for everyone. But as for me, I had a great time. Personally I think Pixar's been on a great stretch from Coco, Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4, and now this. Definitely looking forward to Soul.", "Heck, I have an amazing and present father and a great older brother and this movie still broke my heart. Made me cry multiple times, or maybe I\u2019m just emotional from pandemic stress.\n\nEither way, it was a great movie.", "Loved this movie! Anyone who lost someone to Covid-19 and didn't get to say goodbye to their love one should probably avoid this film at all costs", "Why did I cry over a car?!", "One thing im suprised no one mentioned was the fact that the dragon was literally made by the school. Highschool was something Ian was very very scared about and in a fantasy setting, Is like facing a dragon and to defeat it you have to use you Heart's fire, Trust/Faith for things to work out, and Focus. \n\nI also people complain about how Ian's goal to meet his Dad took a 180 at the end but I think what alot of people forget is Ian's goal in the beginning was literally spelled out to him. Be Like Dad. Which he arguably starts to. It just wasnt his dad to show him how but his brother to push him and bring out his potential he already has.\n\n\nI was also pleasantly suprised to hear that it was from the same director that driected Monsters U which wasnt also very well received but I loved. I hope these reviews dont stop pixar from making his movies because I feel his stories are very specific and relies alot on personal history of the viewer to hit an emotional mark. In the end he is a true Artist who tells his story and knows that there are people out there who needs a story like these.", "@everyone saying the movie had a slow beginning- how?!\nI was tearing up less than 10 minutes in, when Ian meets a friend of his dad's. I've daydreamed about such moments when I meet a friend of my mom's.\n\nAnd then him talking to his dad through the tape? Goodbye, I'm dead.", "You think this is a movie about fatherhood but it turns into a movie about brotherhood.\n \nSo good.", "\"You're never gonna get another chance, MERGEEEEEEEE!!!!\"", "Honestly, I\u2019ve never been more emotional through  a Pixar film...this one hit SO close to home on many levels. Watching this film with my little brother who\u2019s in high school and our mother, it genuinely felt like they emulated our family as elves. Outstanding job to everyone who worked on this film, you captured magic. Can\u2019t wait to rewatch this one", "The gag with the plane in the background when they trekked across the plains was priceless", "My husband I just watched this movie this morning. Should not have done this while 6 months pregnant. Had an utter meltdown at the end, was trying not to let my husband see me cry because when we watched inside out during my last pregnancy and I sobbed over bing bong  he teased me for it. This time, He decided to make a joke about covid getting him (he\u2019s immunocompromised so it\u2019s a real concern we have) to try to break the tension because it turns out he was crying too, and instead I absolutely lost it. It\u2019s been three hours and we\u2019re both sitting here emotionally devastated. My two year old has no idea why her parents are losing their shit.\n\nTl;dr do not watch if you are pregnant or if you are expecting a child in some way. The ending is soul crushing.", "Everyone saw \"the dad only having a few moments\" coming, but I didnt see the whole \"son not getting to even meet him\" coming, that was really nice. \n\nIt's not Pixars best, but that's a club of absurdly good films. This is still fantastic by all means imo.", "One thing I never thought I\u2019d ever witness is a short film of \u201cThe Simpson\u2019s\u201d before a Disney/Pixar film. If you had told me five years ago that such a thing was going to happen, I probably would\u2019ve said \u201cCool\u201d but then laughed and called you crazy. \n\nI\u2019d seen the reviews for Onward in the days leading up to me seeing it. It seems to have gotten a lot of mixed reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Ian and Barley are awesome characters, and I loved Mrs. Lightfoot. She was tough. Barley describing what his father went through in his final days was pretty dark and unexpected for a Pixar film, and I\u2019m talking about a studio that made a film where a bunch of toys were nearly burned alive. \n\nI\u2019m rather interested in what New Mushroomton and the overall universe in Onward has to offer. I almost wouldn\u2019t mind if something was made specifically for Disney+ where Ian and Barley go on all of these adventures and quests based off of the role playing game that Barley plays. \n\nOverall, it was a very good film. Maybe I\u2019m just easily entertained (My friend and I got to the movies a lot and I, just like anyone else, have watched tons of films throughout my 21 years on this earth and I think I can count on maybe one hand the amount of films I didn\u2019t like) but I loved it. I recommend it wholeheartedly.", "I liked this movie, did anybody notice Tripledent gum from Inside Out on a shelf at the Gas Station.", "For some reason I sat through the checklist scene dry eyed and then absolutely broke when Ian was watching his brother say bye to his dad through the rocks. Such a powerful scene. So glad they didn\u2019t cop out and let Ian meet their dad. So much more emotionally meaningful this way", "Cried like a baby during the end.  Such a good flick.", "My husband's dad died when he was 13 from brain cancer. He was the youngest boy and this hit him hard. I couldn't even look over at him since he way crying so hard.", "Just a little movie detail I noted, Laurel steps on Barley's game piece by accident, then kicks it into his room and tells him to pick up his soldier. I'm sure this is a nod to the original Toy Story where Andy's mom steps on the green soldier.", "I don't know why this is getting mediocre reviews, I thought it was the best pixar movie since Toy Story 3. amazing. But maybe because it touched my nerdy heart strings", "Solid movie.  I loved how they did the dragon.  \n\nForever ride, Guinevere.", "I love how recent all the comment are on this month-old thread. Praise be to Disney+.", "Just finished this movie and I loved it. One of the things I was interested in was the world. Some people kinda saw it as a gimmick like \u201cour world but with a D&D twist\u201d but the twists it takes on it is always fun to see. The whole movie being one big quest with destinations playing into it being modern was dope and really gave a sense of adventure when they had to improvise cause things were different. \n\nThe dynamic of the brothers was also great. Loved to see how they grew together. And the story Chris Pratt\u2019s character gave about losing the chance to say goodbye was surprisingly real. All the characters were awesome. The mom being a badass cause her sons were in trouble is always a cool trope to see. And the stepdad not really being bad but misunderstood cause he\u2019s different  is something I\u2019m glad was explored. \n\nI gotta say that ending killed me tho. Like why\u2019d Pixar had to do that to me. Wasn\u2019t the storybook ending but it was still satisfying to see play out as bittersweet it was.\n\nOverall great movie and I get some people don\u2019t see Pixar as the same as they used to be but I really liked this movie and can\u2019t think this would be considered one of their \u201cunderwhelming\u201d movies.", "As someone who has lost a parent and would do absolutely anything to meet them even for one second, I absolutely loved this movie and was sobbing through some bits of it.\n\nI loved how he realised older brother was like a father figure to him. It's honestly true to life, for me. Barley getting to hug & say goodbye to his father.. I was a mess. \n\nI absolutely loved this movie. I'm sad there are so many negative reviews.", "Real nice of Pixar to decide to make a movie perfectly designed to make me weep repeatedly throughout", "I love the metal track when the first van going to suicide. Amazingggg", "I absolutely love the modernized medieval design.", "As the younger brother, and someone with an absent father. This movie kind of destroyed me a bit. In a good way, but damn.", "Really thought they're going with the cliche \"old bro gets jealous of his young bro's inate talent\" route, so it's a nice surprise to see that he's been nothing but supportive all the way. May not be my pick for best Pixar movie, but it still easily managed to warm the cockles of my heart. And that's all I could ever ask for from a Pixar movie.", "Man the final act is so good", "This movie absolutely emotionally destroyed me. I was honestly floored by how good of a movie it was after the trailer made it look pretty meh. It might be top tier Pixar for me.", "Terrific movie. Solid 8.5/10. \n\nI really really loved this movie. Such a unique story in my opinion", "Was it amongst Pixar\u2019s best? IMO no, but I still really enjoyed it. The ideas about death resonated a lot with me: the fact that, in reality, we don\u2019t get more time with the people we lose (Ian and his dad), the fantasy of being able to say goodbye to people we\u2019ve lost unexpectedly(Barley and his dad), and that sometimes the people we needed were there the whole time and we didn\u2019t realize it (Ian & Barley\u2019s relationship). \n\n7.5/10, I cried.", "Although I lost my mother not my father when I was a small child, (and have sat through countless dead mom movies), to me this one was by far the most accurate in depicting how it feels to grow up without a parent. The eagerness to hear about them from people who knew them, the wishing you had more memories of them, the longing to just be with them. I don't know what my mother's voice sounded like and have always wished to hear it and that tape scene hit me in the heart.", "Man this fucking movie hit me harder than I thought, my brother has been a father figure to me throughout my life and more than once I have called him a screw-up... I need to go hug that mofo", "I cried \ud83d\ude22..it really hit me in the feels. I hate this movie dammit. It scarred me having to see this boy walk around with his dad's legs the whole movie and never get to see him \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. That was depressing! I thought the time would start over. I don't need an explanation on way it didn't start over, I understand why it didn't. I just always expect more of a happy ending from Disney. I have enough reality in my life. I watch Disney to escape from reality.", "This movie was a breath of fresh air. I was excited for Incredibles 2, only to be underwhelmed.  Same for Finding Dory, and Toy Story 4. I felt like they were trying to milk their IPs as much as possible, completely driving the future of these installments off a cliff.\n\nEnter Onward, a movie with lovable characters, an exciting world, and a fun adventure. Sure the plot wasn't original as something like Inside Out, but this movie achieved what I thought it was put out to do. Create an original story that people can relate to, all while having some fun with it. \n\nI'd take a new IP like Onward more than a bullshit sequel like Toy Story 4 any day.", "Today, Pixar made me feel emotions for a car being destroyed. Not a care with a face of emotions or something, just a car.", "Alternate ending: The 24 hours expire while Barley is hugging dad and the legs disappear, but the clock never started on the top half so at the end of the hug Barley is just holding the top half. Then they spend 24 hours playing catch, laughing, and sharing stories with the dad's top half while carrying him around.", "The mom is a total badass", "As someone who lost a parent as a child, this movie made me cry on three separate occasions. I don\u2019t even know if this movie was good, but it broke me down like an absolute baby. Loved it, but probably can\u2019t watch it again for a bit.\n\nGonna go cuddle with my kids now.", "For as much as the legs were a part of the marketing's, they were just a Macguffin. That's not a bad thing, mind you, but I feel like somewhere along the way, they decided \"We can't make the audience care about legs, so we aren't even going to try.\" Credit where it's due, I was engaged the whole way through, because the actual emotional center was the character.", "It was slow at first, but I thought it picked up nicely and continued up and down the whole way. It really reminded me of shrek and as another user said in this thread \u201cfrozen for brothers\u201d lol.\n\nI loved the unicorns! And the dragons face at the end, I think they balanced the humor and heart nicely but there was a lot of fluff. It hit close to home for me so I\nWelled up a few times, but overall I left the theater feeling cozy. It was a cute movie overall.", "Absolutely loved every bit of this movie. I was expecting there to maybe be some emotional tones, but didn't think I'd be ugly crying until I was. As a car person, the van suicide was hilarious to me and totally could relate to how he felt making that sacrifice.", "Not even joking, I think this is a flawless movie. I enjoyed everything about it. The animation was fantastic, the humor was brilliant, the story was intriguing and hits you hard emotionally, and it\u2019s unique and refreshingly new. There were times it could\u2019ve easily used predictable tropes but it didn\u2019t. The voice acting performances were great. The character development was done so well, especially for ian. I loved this movie a lot, and it\u2019s even cooler knowing the director is from my hometown, which is awesome because Clawson, Michigan is seriously a small town that\u2019s very far away from Hollywood, so seeing dan Scanlon work his way up to make this amazing film is so cool and inspiring to see. But anyways, this films a 9/10 from me, loved it a lot.", "I'm gonna be honest, when I got out of the cinema I was a bit meh, and I didn't know if the movie was weak, or it was because it was just me and my friend in the cinema.\n\nWhen I got home and I finally had time to process the movie, it just clicked. I was so used to the \"Disney\" formula I was convinced there would be a villain in the story (I was so sure the father would be a douche or the mother had a dark secret idk). \"Onward\" was enjoyable in a unique way and the plot twist fan inside me wasn't convinced it was a good movie.\n\nAll in all, I loved the fantasy setting. The characters were fantastic, and it's the first movie that made me sob over an animated van. I would watch it again with a different mentality and I would sure enjoy it a lot more.", "Makes sense that Barley was the one who said goodbye to his dad instead as he didn\u2019t have the courage to when he was younger :\u2019)", "Just finished watching this movie and my god was it amazing. From reading the comments id have to agree I have had a troubled past with my father leaving when I was born and bouncing in and out of my life and this one just absolutely destroyed my emotions.

That whole last part made me a mess.\n\nAnd then that [credits song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow3m_aZngvU). Just wow, right into my heart. Got me all emotional again.

Wish I could have watched it with my younger brother though.", "Will Disney ever stop killing Chris Pratt's parents just for the sake of plot?", "Pizza Planet made a cameo as a sticker on the cooler in the van.", "An amazing movie. I went in with low expectations, I thought it'd be a cute little film. Boy, I was wrong - I cried a few times during this and I really related to the main character. When I was his age, and even at times now as an adult, I feel the same fear and lack of confidence he had. I was shocked at the end with the twist of allowing his brother to see his dad - I sobbed!! Such an emotional movie, it turned out being more than what I expected it to be.  As others have said and I agree with - I liked it more than even TS4.", "Thoroughly enjoyed it, the emotional beats really worked for me. I really connected with Ian and his relationship with Barley.

Seems a bit familiar.", "We are now a part of a world where the Simpsons are a Pixar Short. Saluting their new corporate overlords, indeed!", "This whole movie was just a DnD campaign and I absolutely loved it.", "I must say, this movie surprised me. It balanced realism with fantasy quite well and I found myself interested in all the characters. I wish we got a *little* more with the Corey and Colt, but that's just a nitpick. What I loved most is Ian realizing Barley was the fatherly figure in his life, and allowing Barley to have his goodbye with his father since he missed his opportunity. It really was emotional to have Barley talk to his father away from the camera, which feels like we are eagerly watching on from afar like Ian. There was no jealousy or anger, just pure satisfaction and joy.\n\n8/10, would definitely consider buying this on Blu-ray.", "Non spoiler review:\nOK, short back story on me. I am a 19 year old obsessed with Fantasy (LotR, D&D, WoT, Malazan, all that) animated movies, (especially Pixar) and I had a parent pass when I was young. To say I was excited for this movie barely scratches the surface, and let me just say - it exceeded my expectations. Is it the best Pixar movie? I dunno, IMO that probably still goes to Wall-E, or Toy Story or something, but Onward is probably my new favorite due to my personal experience with the movie. I sat in the theater after the movie was done and sobbed into my hands for about 10 minutes. The emotion of these characters was so genuine, their journeys were touching, and the story is a rootin tootin spin on classic fantasy that was so fun. This one's special. 10/10", "A lot better than I expected especially after the trailers that made it out to be generic. The chemistry and character development between the two brothers is terrific. At the movie's core, it's really just well done a coming of age story for Ian. Seeing him go from Peter Parker to Doctor Strange was great. All the poignant parts on the film feel earned from the build ups. \n\nThought it was also interesting that the movie has a slight conservative slant of \"the old days being better\" along with being somewhat anti-technology.", "This was such a good fantasy movie.  It understood that fantasy is just a stylish backdrop.  You still need good characters and a touching story to make it great.  I wish more fantasy movies got that (Warcraft, Eragon, etc.).", "This movie is cute but sad.", "This was a very cute movie. The setting screams DreamWorks so I had my reservations going in, but it definitely has that gut punch emotional moment we've come to love Pixar for. Outside of that moment, though, lies a pretty solid movie that probably won't be remembered as the studios best by anyone. \n\nVoice acting was solid. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland very at home as the boisterous nerd/fantasy/metal brother and the introverted teen respectively. Love Julia Louis and I love that they gave her a pretty cool arc. \n\nOverall I'd say about half the humor was landing and the other half was pretty simple. I didn't dislike this movie in any way, but when it wasn't making me want to cry it wasn't really holding my attention either. \n\nI was glad that there was no twist surrounding whose legs they were, and I thought the twist that Pratt's character needed time with his dad more and the sacrifice that comes of that really well done. Outside of that, this is a pretty run of the mill adventure movie. There's action scenes that all translate nicely to the journey of the main character and very few twists or moments of hopelessness. \n\nI was a little confused by the logic of the setting. Probably one of those Cars things where it's not really meant to be examined, but I just didn't really understand why no one seemed to consider magic as a possibility despite people from the magic era still being alive, like the Manticore. Like, magic is still real enough that a child could do it with no real training and people from the time of magic are still just like alive and middle aged, yet no one else in the movie uses it and is completely flabbergasted by its existence. I know technology pushed it out, it's just the way people treated magic you'd think no one's seen it used for hundreds of years despite the dad apparently having been a big wizard in college. \n\nI'd give it a solid 7/10.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "Damned good movie but it felt it was missing something.  Maybe because the story beats were just as expected, even if I loved the characters and world building.  \n\nI loved using the base of fantasy world tropes and seeing the modern extension. A lot of great thought went into it (compared to say.. bright)  but all without leaning on popculture references directly.

I think it's biggest flaw is that it didn't have that distinct pixar feel. Typical tear jerker ending even though the movie didn't have the implicit emotional build of a typical pixar movie instead opting for a more explicit buildup. Felt a little shallower than typical pixar because of this and therefore less cinematic. That being said, the concept is just too fun, the performances are solid, and the ending is just a fantastic subversion of expectations and made it that much more emotional.  \n  \n7/10 pretty much what you expect from the trailer.", "I actually really liked this one moreso than some of the others in recent years.

It was missing that Pixar humor and a lot of plot points were rushed just to keep things going. The manticore burns her restaurant to the ground because one kid says something, Ian learns all the spells within a day...\n\nBut then the checklist scene happened and it got me. Not a perfect movie, but the ending was pretty emotional and worth the journey getting there.

Usually the character growth feels a bit sudden and shallow to me.

But there were many other things to enjoy, like...\n\nAnya really acts. There are a few relatively long takes where she goes through several emotions. It's impressive, and subtle for a movie with so many gaudy notes.\n\nSpeaking of gaudy, the costumes and settings are all brilliant. I found this tiring at moments, but overall very well executed, and the seasons and varying shot lengths helped break up the visual sense a lot.\n\nSpeaking of breaking up the pace, the movie moved through a lot of emotions extremely well. Funny, hopeful, tragic, annoyed, scheming, proud, ashamed, and back to funny again.\n\nEveryone acted so well. I know I'll see a good gif of Mr Eliot untying his cape sometime when I least want to.", "\"When have you ever stopped at three?\"\n\nI saw this with my old college roommate last week. We've seen dozens of movies in theaters over the years, but I've never seen him react so viscerally when Emma dropped that line. He gasped out loud (along with the entire theater), rolled in his seat, and whispered to me, \"Dude, I didn't know there was going to be a murder in this movie!\"\n\nOn a side note, Johnny Flynn looks like a combination of Heath Ledger and Jason Segel. I made a mental note early on to check who the actor is for Mr. Knightley in the credits.", "I'm sure at some point in my life someone told me Clueless was based on a Jane Austen novel, but since I'd never really read any Austen I must have ignored it. So imagine my surprise when 30 minutes in my friend turns to me and says, \"So this is basically Clueless, right?\" Initially I was thinking, yeah I suppose in some ways. And then I realized Mister Elton is the same character and has the same purpose as Elton from Clueless and I instantly realized that was a straight adaptation. And I really only mention it here to get it out of the way, but I have to say realizing that made me both appreciate how genius Clueless is (already loved that movie) and how timeless Austen's writing really is. I really enjoyed picking out scenes and characters and remembering their Clueless counterparts.\n\nAnyways, moving on to specifically things about this movie, I loved it. It's really well shot, Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible, everyone is so perfectly cast, the humor is subtle but very much there. And something it did much better than Clueless, IMO, is represent the really human moments. The way Ms. Bates was hilariously annoying and then goes on to break my fucking heart in the last act surprised the hell out of me. \n\nMs. Bates is only one of so many ridiculous yet fully realized characters in this. The first argument Knightley and Emma had about Harriet was so good because you can really see both of their perspectives. Why would you stand in the way of someone's happiness? Well why would you put a cap on what she can achieve in this time when achievement is based on how high you can marry? Mix that in with some really top tier high class burns and this movie just had me very much on board.\n\nBill Nighy definitely deserves a shoutout here, too. Probably a character that had the least amount of affect on the plot, yet every moment he's on screen he's stealing the scene. He is hilarious in moments when he's obsessing over that \"ghastly chill\", and then there's the scene where he sees Emma crying in the hallway and he has no idea what to say beyond sitting in comfort. It's both a funny and very poignant moment. \n\nIt's great that the plot is as fun as it is and the characters are as good as they are, but this is Anya's movie. She portrays Emma's arc so well, going from an outside observer unbothered by anything to the woman who can't wait to marry and be part of the community she has been influencing from afar. The turning point obviously being when she insults Ms. Bates in front of everyone, watching her deal with what she'd done was fascinating. She ignores it at first despite it happening right in front of her and in public, she tries to downplay it but Knightley won't let her get away with that. He holds her accountable and it breaks her. And then it broke me when she brings Ms. Bates the gift basket and all Ms. Bates can say with complete earnest is, \"Always so kind.\" \n\nI can't wait to see this movie again. It was so beautiful. Every outfit, every shot, every extravagance was on point. I suppose my only criticism is that so many character introductions happen through conversation and so fast that I had the slightest of difficulties figuring out everyone's relation to each other, but that didn't keep it from being one of my favorites of the year so far. I need to watch it again to really decide if it's an 8 or a 9/10, but regardless I would recommend this movie to just about anyone.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "this movie has the best sexual tension in a period piece I've ever seen", "Man this was so, so, so, so, good. Saw it last weekend and have not stopped thinking about it since. I am a big time Austen fan, and have read all her books and seen most movies and TV adapts based on her work, and Emma is the least favorite of her books for me, by a mile, but a bad Austen is still better than just about anything else. This movie does Emma justice, full stop, and IMO should be the definitive version of Emma going forward (that\u2019s why there\u2019s a period in the title!), but this is not a movie for die hard language purists, but it captures the feel and spirit of Austen and Emma so well. So many adaptations forget that her real thing was cutting social satires and comedies of manners, and this version balances it spectacularly.\n\nThis is not a movie for die hard language purists, but Anya\u2019s casting was genius-The focus on Emma\u2019s loneliness and isolation as a big reason for her meddling humanizes her so well. Johnny Flynn makes you *feel* Knightley\u2019s transformation, and I loved the choice to focus way less on his age than on his role as the one person in town who will check her worst impulses. Bill Nighy was fabulous, and got tons of laugh lines, and made Mr. Woodhouse much less frustrating and repetitive than in other versions-the scene where Emma is upset at the window and he just like gently comforts her was spot on.\n\nBut I think my biggest revelation was Autumn de Wilde-good lord what a spectacular directing job. Every frame was a painting! Her eye for framing is bonkers-totally agreed on the comment below about Knightley freaking out on the floor and the servant backing out getting tons of laughs. I am so excited to see what she directs next-this was an insane first feature. Total sharp control over all of it, color, lighting, blocking, all of it. And great music too! The song Queen Bee that Johnny Flynn plays over the credits has been stuck in my head all week. \n\nJust, like, go see this movie. I hate how much I love this movie, lol, and that it may change my opinion of the source material for good!

(of course there's ample room for much to criticize about the social behaviors we see in the film, but this aside. . . ) I like that Wilde maintained the age gap in that she would have had so much room to pull a well-known British actor for the role and she went with a guy who's only been in a few things and he KILLED IT. damn, yes Nighy was great in every scene he was in but the absolute same for Flynn, who was almost always felt like the most interesting person on the screen in every scene. \n\ni quite liked this film", "She was the perfect Emma.

Lovely ladies and dishy dudes, everyone in the audience can find someone to fanboy or fangirl over. \n\nFast-paced, dialogues appropriately snarky. The general fluffiness makes Emma's social gaffes, especially her remark to Miss Bates, really stand out.\n\nThe costumes are fantastic, and we even get some glimpses of the characters dressing and undressing, so we can see some thoughts went into appropriate undergarments (which is important for getting the right silhouette).\n\nThe schoolgirls in their red outfits gave me some Handmaid's Tale flashbacks, not sure whether this was intentional. Very effective though.\n\nThe soundtrack alternates between orchestral music, religious hymns and folk songs (at least that's what is sounded like to me). These would be types of music that the characters would know. And when the dialogues are not enough, the music may provide commentary on the characters' actions.\n\nVery, very well made. And very enjoyable.", "Not gonna lie I liked Little Women a lot more.

Whenever Taylor-Joy is on screen, she fills it with a kind of radiance that is only seen in classic beauty types. Nighy is a delight and gives the film much needed comic relief. \n\nThe wit is on par with other classic works, like Shakespeare, and is never more scathing than when Emma exuberantly quips that Miss Bates is a dullard.\n\nThe framing is gorgeous when it focuses on characters' faces and the cinematography is lush in its periodic bravura.\n\nWhat is most refreshing is that this take on the story is rich with relatability.

Would watch over 1996 any day of the week.\n\nWhomever did the cut and color for the cast deserves everything.  And wardrobe, my god.  \n\n4/5", "Overall, I didn\u2019t like it. I seem to be in the minority. Like a lot of recent adaptations, I think this version is aimed at teenagers, and people who haven\u2019t yet read the book. \n\nSome observations, in no particular order:\n\n*Visually, it was pitch-perfect. Everything looked like a box of chocolates. Autumn De Wilde is a photographer, and it shows, because the cinematography is really something.\n\n*With a few caveats (what was up with Knightley\u2019s collar obscuring 40% of his face?), the costumes and sets were gorgeous. I didn\u2019t like Emma\u2019s ramen-noodle hair, and Harriet\u2019s hairstyles were way more elaborate than they would have been for someone of her means and social class. But Emma\u2019s dresses and hats were exquisite.\n\n*The music was beautiful, but a slightly bizarre jumble of styles. I personally love traditional folk in movie soundtracks, but I\u2019m not convinced it suits Jane Austen. The score was also very \u201cYOU\u2019RE WATCHING A COMEDY, LAUGH HERE\u201d at some points.\n\n*Ana Taylor-Joy was well-cast. She looks perfect for the role, and she handles the lines well.\nI don\u2019t think she always gets it right, but that may have more to do with directorial choices than her acting. Emma came across as really bitchy in the first \u00be of the film, as opposed to a basically good and kind 21-year-old who has never had her privilege challenged. And the change in her character isn\u2019t as apparent as I wish it had been. They had to invent stuff to make Emma look like she\u2019d matured \u2013 intervening to make Mr Martin marry Harriet, and promising to invite Harriet\u2019s deadbeat dad to Hartfield \u2013 when the story itself indicates the change in her character much more deftly.\n\n*I\u2019m not a fan of Johnny Flynn as Knightley. Everyone\u2019s talking about how steamy this adaptation is, and I felt there was almost no chemistry between the leads. Johnny Flynn always seems more like a villain than a romantic lead to me. And he looks like he should be surfing in 21st century Torquay, not sipping wine in Regency England. He\u2019s technically the right age to play Knightley, but he doesn\u2019t have the maturity the character needs. He\u2019s way too dour and serious in the first half, and instead of witty banter between he and Emma (played so rightly by a smirking, winking Jeremy Northam in the 1996 version), he\u2019s just argumentative and bossy. He openly shouts at Emma several times, which gentlemen in Jane Austen novels absolutely did not do, Knightley least of all. Knightley and Emma are really supposed to be friends, and we didn\u2019t get much of a glimpse of that friendship. And they tried to make him comical by having him run after Emma\u2019s carriage, and it fell flat for me.\n\n*Knightley and Jane are not good classical singers in their awkward duet! Jane is supposed to be a much more accomplished singer than Emma. Knightley is not supposed to sing at all.\n\n*Mia Goth nailed Harriet. I feel like it\u2019s hard to get Harriet right. She needs to be not unattractive, but a bit gauche. And Mia Goth was very expressive and emotional, which suited Harriet\u2019s character. \n\n*The humble finishing school where Harriet is \u201cleft in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can\u201d after an \u201cindifferent education\u201d is actually very grand, and you could park an aircraft in Harriet\u2019s bedroom.\n\n*It was a shame they made Emma\u2019s sister Isabella crotchety and neurotic. We know that Emma considered John and Isabella \u201cpleasant society,\u201d that as a couple they agree on most things except when John \u201cis not quite frightened enough about the children,\u201d and that Isabella can\u2019t bear to be apart from John. We also know that Isabella reminds Mr Knightley of Emma, and spending time with Isabella and John in London confirms his love for Emma: \u201cHe had gone to learn to be indifferent. But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much domestic happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma.\u201d The whole point of their marriage is that it represents the kind of happiness Emma and Mr Knightley can have if they get their act together, so making John and Isabella miserable was a mistake.\n\n*Josh O'Connor was a good Mr Elton. Not Alan Cumming good, but good. I do think they botched the scene in the carriage, which is supposed to be funny but instead feels tragic and a bit frightening. Mr Elton did not scream at Emma, punch the roof of the carriage, and then scramble out to walk home in a blizzard.\n\n*Miranda Hart was perfect as the awkward but sweet Miss Bates, and the Box Hill picnic was absolutely heartbreaking. I didn\u2019t love the way Johnny Flynn yelled at Emma \u2013 it was far too 21st century. Again, Jeremy Northam did this better \u2013 he was angry, but he was also devastated that Emma was capable of such unkindness, so there was a sadness and even a sympathy in it.\n\n*I loathed Mr Woodhouse. Everyone\u2019s talking about how great Bill Nighy was, and I thought the characterisation was abysmal. He\u2019s supposed to be elderly and in poor health, annoying but not essentially bad. He serves to highlight Emma\u2019s better qualities \u2013 most people would be driven mad by his whims, but she\u2019s loving and patient. In this film he was marching around the house in excellent health barking orders at his servants, and I\u2019m just not sure what purpose he served as a character. He just lingered awkwardly on the fringes of the action looking blank.\n\n*Why did we have to see Knightley having his pants put on and Emma airing her bare backside in front of the fire? I\u2019m not a fan of throwing risqu\u00e9 stuff into Jane Austen novels for no good reason. I feel like this book missed a lot of the comedy in the writing, and awkwardly inserted it where it didn\u2019t belong. Which brings me to\u2026\n\n*THE PROPOSAL SCENE. I hated it. I could not hate it more. It\u2019s supposed to be a moment of sincerity and sweetness in an often comical story, and they butchered it by giving Emma a NOSEBLEED? Whyeee? We had to watch her nose bleeding into her teeth while she was talking. And instead of the beautiful dialogue we get from Jane Austen, Emma starts yelling at Mr Knightley about Harriet and then storms off, bleeding into a handkerchief, because for some reason her engagement to him depends on Mr Martin marrying Harriet. The music indicated that it was supposed to be funny and endearing, but it just wasn\u2019t. Emma seemed petulant and spoiled and like she hadn\u2019t changed at all.\n\nSo overall, yeah, it wasn\u2019t my thing. The direction was a little clumsy. I\u2019ve read the novel countless times, and seen a lot of previous adaptations more than once. I feel like a lot of scenes and characters were misinterpreted, and it just didn\u2019t hit the right notes, or capture the tone of the novel. It tried too hard to wring laughs out of the audience, and lacked emotional heft. I wish Autumn De Wilde had stepped back a bit and let the text do its thing, because it really is a witty, joyful story, and it doesn\u2019t need bare backsides and nosebleeds.\n\nIf anyone has bothered to read this far: read the novel. It\u2019s a delicious experience that will trump any film or television adaptation, and it\u2019s the perfect comfort-read during self-isolation.", "So much of the focus in frame comes down to the characters\u2019 eyes. Really fun movie, I\u2019m not really familiar with Jane Austen\u2019s work but this was a good entry point for me. Anya Taylor-Joy is a really great performer.", "I loved Emma! Anya Taylor-Joy is even better than Kate Beckinsale or Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. It's a lot like The Favourite, Barry Lyndon, or Marie Antoinette. I think Autumn de Wilde's direction is really refreshing. I would not be surprised if Emma remained my favorite film of 2020.", "Very sweet movie, the theme song though is amazing.", "I thought this movie took about 15 minutes to get going but I was pretty mesmerized after that by everything, especially Taylor-Joy, but she\u2019s mesmerizing in everything so not a shock", "I think my thoughts are similar to many others posting here. Delightful movie throughout. Romantic period pieces are often not my thing, but this movie is a lot of fun, and even though the end is somewhat predictable, the trip to get there is worth it. Anya Taylor-Joy was very good, and Johnny Flynn does well with his role. The dialogue was fun and delivered well.\n\nThe obvious comparison is to the recent Little Women, and I think I left Little Women feeling a bit more moved, but Emma is also a very delightful and accessible period piece.", "Am kinda familiar with Jane Austen \u2014 well, Pride & Prejudice, and S&S. I saw the Paltrow Emma movie years ago, but don\u2019t remember much from it. So basically I went in expecting good period film, fun costumes. \n\nThe entire film, I was absolutely loving the costuming! (Maybe minus some of the rather thin fabrics on the men\u2019s breeches that made everything look rather... testicular...) \n\nLoved the details in the shoes the women wore, and how Emma had like leather covers for dancing, on her shoes, that she took off after getting home to sit in the window after the ball. \n\nEmma hiking up her skirt to warm her rear on the fire \u2014 A Plus! Relatable! Even though she can be mean and and bitchy, she\u2019s still just a person who wants their rear warmed by the fire. \n\nI really liked (Yara Greyjoy\u2019s) green dress with the sleeve caps that looked like leaves! She wore it a couple times, and it was so cute. \n\nThere were a couple things I really liked, where there seemed to be a visual focus on Emma\u2019s eyes, while she\u2019s thinking... and also focusing on hands, her father\u2019s anxious hands while he\u2019s trying to figure out how to calm her, Emma fidgets too... and the focus on her holding his hand at the altar! So good! \n\nCostume highlights: \nEmma\u2019s white dress with the green/blue gradient ribbon! I love the flower details!\n\nEmma and her sister\u2019s blue velvet outfits \u2014 so visually pleasing! \n\nEmma\u2019s white dress for the ball \u2014 it had these really nice leafy/garland ribbons on the front and back, and I just was in love! \n\nEmma\u2019s pink cropped jacket with fancy sleeve caps? So cool! \n\n(Also the dresstops that look like they\u2019re just a velvet bust/crop over an underdress, like the lilac velvet one? And the mustard yellow one? Both with white underdresses showing) \n\nEmma\u2019s fancy hats!!! \n\n\n\nTanya and Connor from Sex Education!!! I knew Tanya would be in this movie (she was part of what I was excited for!) and I LOVE how bitchy and snide she was! Her outfits and hair were SO EXTRA! It was great. Also love that Connor Swindells got to be a nice farm boy who didn\u2019t say much at all. That was great to see both of them in a movie.\n\nOverall: much more hilarious than I was expecting. Costumes were so great! I liked this a lot more than I was expecting to.", "The use of the servants in this film was fantastic.", "This is my favorite movie of the year so far. Wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did. Took me awhile to realize it was Clueless.\n\nAlso, Mrs. Elton is my MVP. What else was Tanya Reynolds in? She's just naturally hilarious.", "I enjoyed this! Anya Taylor-Joy is very good, everyone is good for that matter. I felt it dragged in the middle, and the start was a bit scattershot to set up the characters and was not heavy on plotting, but overall I had fun with this one. Bill Nighy was barely in this film but I feel like his character was the one of the most realized outside the top three leads. \n\n7/10, would recommend. The costumes are beautiful and quite a few of the shots are gorgeous.\n\nI have not read the book.", "I had no idea why the Drafthouse played a trailer for Clueless before this. Then about a third of the way through the movie, I remembered it was supposed to be a modern-day adaptation of the same story. I spent the rest of the movie over analyzing comparisons between the two. Oops!\n\nIt was fun though. Loved the style and the music. From the gratuitous butt shot in the beginning, it was obvious who the real romantic lead was.", "This was utterly delightful, loved how funny it was! The only other Emma adaptation I've seen is Clueless so I was sort of tracking it to that in my head to keep track of everything, but man this was great. Taylor-Joy was great, and I really liked Johnny Flynn too; Nighy and the Vicar (>!and his wife!<) were also A+ performances. Already given the soundtrack a listen or two, as well! Flynn actually sings two of the folk songs.", "This movie is 80% Bill Nighy making displeased faces at things, and I am here for it.\n\nI\u2019ve never read the novel, but this was extremely well done. Well-shot, good casting and performances, and definitely did not expect the social commentary about Emma\u2019s machinations and the limits of her viewpoint and intentions. Just excellent.", "Poor Miss Bates :'(\n\nI expected this to be funnier, but yeah it looked great and every character felt fleshed-out and important. The names were really hard to keep up with though. Loved the sneakily deep-cuts in the dialogue too. It's like everyone was Meryl Streep's character in Little Women, turned up 200%.", "I liked it, it was a nice, pretty, well acted English country house and costume porn showcase, but I don't think it brought much that was new to this type of adaptation, and I would say that Gwyneth is still the definitive Emma. While everyone was at least good, Johnny Flynn was a standout. The actress who played Mrs Elton was also very funny\n\nI did kind of feel that this portrayal probably aggrandized the wealth and style of life of people who were untitled country gentry with one estate each rather than the big-time aristocrats", "I\u2019ve binge watched  it 3 times during quarantine period and still could not recover how beautifuly made this new version of Emma is.. \n\nThe customs, settings, regency era\u2019s standards are reflected  perfectly with the touch of Autumn de Wilde. \n\nThe beauty of this new Emma is that it does so much more. De Wilde, who honed her visual eye in music videos and commercial work, crafts an elaborate but tidy confection, a series of tableaux as symmetrically pastel as anything in Wes Anderson, but the movie sullies its silk gloves by giving more screen time to servants, farm laborers and livestock than any Jane Austen adaptation I can think of. And this is the thing I would like to see any new adoptions of Jane Austen classics.  \ud83d\udc96", "Really enjoyed everything about this, and most of the reasons have been stated by others. However the thing I liked the most is that it's the first adaptation of these period piece novels where the lives of the characters is portrayed as ridiculous and preposterous. The numerous interactions with \"the help\" really highlight just how silly some of these people were. Really enjoyed that because every other adaptation I've seen always takes these people seriously. I was glad to see they were basically the joke here.", "Did anyone else get major Dennis (It's Always Sunny) vibes from Mr. Elton? I'm sure if we look hard enough, we can detect all six steps of the D.E.N.N.I.S. System in Elton's failed courting of Emma.", "Loved it. One of my fave renditions of Emma. WAY BETTER than the Gwyneth Paltrow version. Anya and Johnny had great chemistry.", "A film score hasn\u2019t delighted me this much since lord  of the rings. So fucking good.", "Good to see Anya Taylor-Joy living deliciously. I've not read the book but it was a fun movie, the performances were all very good and even though the plot was pretty cookie cutter the humour and performances were enough to keep me entertained and engaged. Josh O'Connor as the priest was a show stealer for me and Anya Taylor-Joy continues to impress me in her roles, will be interested to see what she continues to do.", "Emma is one of my favorite stories, so I was basically going to like this movie no matter what, but I think the Gwenyth Paltrow version is slightly better and \"Clueless\" is one of my all-time favorite movies and still my favorite adaptation of this story. \n\nThis version was good too, but it felt really long at some points. I wish the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax subplot had resolved a little more clearly, they were just kind of given a one-off line as an ending. \n\nI thought Elton was hilarious, as was Mr. Woodhouse's constantly complaining about drafts. I liked Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma a lot, she has great facial expressions.\n\nI kind of didn't like the nosebleed scene \u2014 was that in the book? It felt slapstick and took me out of the movie a bit.", "Delightful as hell. Anya Taylor-Joy is a treasure. 7.5/10", "Just wanna say that I absolutely love the cinematography, every frame a painting philosophy here.", "I think it might be my favorite Emma so far (although I thought Jonny Lee Miller was a better Knightley).  I really liked how the film actually acknowledged the existence of lust, which most of them (and Jane Austen herself) don't seem to.", "I don't have the knowledge to drop a long thought out review of this movie or any movie tbh, so I will keep it short. I couldn't stop smiling throughout this movie. I found it delightful and charming. I was shook when she dropped that bomb on Mrs. Bates.", "I think this is Anya Taylor Joy best performance so far", "I loved this so so much. Great production design, costumes, and performances (glad that Anya Taylor-Joy is in a relaxing movie for once), and a score partly by Isobel Waller-Bridge!! Heaven. I'll probably end up seeing this again with my mom and I'll be happy to. \n\nI didn't have any familiarity with Emma going in, so some of the more finite plot points were lost on me, although I didn't find it difficult to know what was going on broadly speaking.", "rented the movie started watching it and I absolutely HATE the score. What is up the 1930s sounding hymnals throughout it? So distracting and doesn't fit.\n\nI don't think this is going to be for me. Lead guy is way too scruffy and young to be Knightley too.\n\nVisually beautiful but just not well executed overall. going to finish the rest when I get up because it's not worth staying up late for.\n\nEdit: Watched it all, not impressed. thought Knightley was way too out of character. I still stick with my opinion that the score was terrible. Once again, pretty movie, just poorly done.  I think this project was way too big for Autumn de Wilde to take on as her first time directing.", "I absolutely loved this film! Feels like a crime that it isn't getting the attention the attention it deserves.", "Does anyone know where you can get the shoes that are in this movie?? Or shoes like what are in this movie? They are gorgeous and I WANT them.", "As a fan of Sex Education, seeing Connor Swindells (Robert Martin) and Tanya Reynolds (Mrs. Elton) was a pleasant surprise", "[deleted]", "Forgot the period.", "My old classmate is in this! Good on ya, Amber. I'll catch it at some point over the weekend, based on the glowing reviews on this thread.", "Man, this movie is gorgeous altogether, but those desserts! I'm kinda tempted to try to recreate some of them. They're outrageous, and illustrates the lifestyle of affluent English people in olden times. \n\nI have nothing but praise for this film. Everyone acted so well, and it was nice seeing some of the Cast of Sex Education in the film, it's one of my favourite shows.", "Visually, the movie was beautiful.  But I didn't feel like it got the soul of the story.\n\nEmma is privileged, but well meant.  I don't feel like this version got that.  She comes across as meaner than she is meant to be.\n\nThere are more servants in this movie than in any other Jane Austen adaptation I've seen (and more servants than I think they would have had in real life) which I assume is meant to show the class issues.  But really, Harriet shows the class issues.\n\nHarriet is the \"natural daughter of no one\" but she is educated at a time when many working class people were still illiterate.  That tells us at least one of her parents (most likely her father) comes from money, but they were unable to acknowledge her because Harriet was born outside of wedlock.  The kind of scenario we are talking about is \"Wealthy landowner gets a servant pregnant\" not \"bootmaker randomly sends his child off.\"  Harriet's parents would never acknowledge her as their daughter.  Instead, she's been given an education that would allow her to earn her own income as a teacher or governess.  These positions didn't pay well and weren't generally well suited to married women.  But Harriet's lack of known parents would make her relatively unmarriageable anyway.  The fact that Robert Martin's family embraces her is really lucky for her and Emma is too out of touch to realize that.\n\nPeople are weirded out by Emma befriending Harriet because of the class issues.  Even though her family is poor, Jane Fairfax comes from an established family and is seen as a more appropriate friend.  Mrs. Weston is Emma's former governess and Emma found Mrs. Weston a wealthy husband, but Mrs. Weston (presumably) only had class baggage not illegitimate baggage.  \n\nI didn't love how they handled Isabella and John.  In the book, Isabella is way less intense.  I felt like the movie didn't make it clear that John is Knightley's younger brother.  Emma and Knightley are related by marriage in addition to being neighbors.  But then I've always found the age gap between Emma and Knightley a little creepy- she's 20 and he's 37.", "One of my favorites of the year so far. Funny, dramatically interesting, and beautiful to look at. Anya Taylor-Joy is absolute perfection.", "Decided to read the book when I saw first saw this announced last year and ended up paying the $20 the rent on YouTube. Appreciated that this was pretty faithful to the book. Also really like the visuals and overall tone of the move...the book can be pretty funny and sarcastic at times and that translated really well to the movie. Casting for Emma & Harriet were super good.\n\nI think where this sort of lacks is in secondary characters...but I'm also not sure any 2 hour movie could really do that justice. Jane Austen is just so unbelievably good at writing characters that she can have these very deep secondary characters on the fringes of the book that are hard to capture in  a movie. For example, Mr. Elton's wife is so unbelievably obnoxious in the book but not quite sure that how well gets portrayed in the movie since Austen does it so effectively.  Would be interesting to see books like this done with modern mini-series.\n\nOverall really liked this, but wondering how much of the great depth and subtlety of the novel comes across to people who haven't read the book or at least read it recently", "I liked this the more it went on, I was expecting just some pleasant fluff, but I didn't expect to get so involved in the characters. Loved the performances so much. Johnny Flynn was so sexy in Beast and he's very warm and charming here, too. This is my favorite Joy performance after Thoroughbreds and The Witch. And my obsession with Mia Goth continues, she's honestly one of the most unique and beguiling actresses working today. Always reminds of like the second coming of Shelley Duvall. \n\nIt's visually gorgeous, the sets and costumes are perfection, and it had this modern edge to it that made it feel fresh and lively. It gave me Marie Antoinette vibes at times, only without the 80s soundtrack. But the color palette, lighting, and tone (and desserts) felt very similar.", "I saw this movie a few times in NYC. I was the only person that laughed at \u2018MOTHER, YOU MUST SAMPLE THE TART!\u2019 Guess no one else knew that tart also means hooker.", "Anya Taylor-Joy is brilliant in the titular role and O'Connor, Reynolds, Goth and Nighy (who is a treasure, as usual) also seem to have a lot of fun. I also liked the costumes, but apart from that, the film didn't have much to offer for me. It takes a while to get going and felt rather dull in the first half. Also, for a film about feelings and love, it felt surprisingly cold and lifeless. I'm also a bit confused about the tone of the film. Sometimes it felt more satirical and as if it was mocking its characters, but then again it seems to be really close to the source material and more earnest.\n\nOverall, the film was not nearly as fun to watch, as the trailer made it out to\u00a0be.\n\n6.5/10", "Just dropping in to mention how poorly the release of this film was handled. I was so excited for this movie having seen the trailer a few times in theaters. That being said, I had NO IDEA it was released. I saw no marketing for Emma. At ALL. And this is before COVID-19 really took hold. And I'm in New York!!! And now they put the movie on digital - for a fucking $20 two day rental. More expensive than a movie theater ticket, again, IN NEW YORK. Don't anticipate too many non-coastal would-be filmgoers taking the plunge at that price. I know it's an indie release but they also have to consider the market they're releasing into. I can't justify that price just for a rental.", "I dont understand why you would have such a distinct visual style for this film and not lean into the zaniness. its like they took a standard Austen adaptation and threw it on a technicolor backdrop and called it a day.\n\nalso man it was long.

We tried to make it very mutual.", "Finally able to share my thoughts with a wider audience now that the discussion is live. I caught this early January.\n\nAs a straight male, this movie resonated with me in ways unimaginable.\n\nI don't think its recency bias in the slightest, but as soon as the credits started to roll, wiping the flood of uncontrollable tears, I thought to myself: *\"Yup. This is one of the most beautifully moving films I have ever experienced and an immediate Top 5 favorite of mine.\"*\n\nSo much is said without anything every being said; the film is its loudest, most loving, and most intelligent in its quietest moments. The scenes between Marianne and Heloise during their sessions, especially the one where Heloise questions \"And who do I look at?\" were magnetic despite being such tender, whisper-soft moments.\n\nThere are several scenes that are still imprinted in my mind that I cannot shake, but, above all, those final 10 minutes, but more so those final 4 minutes, during the orchestra, as the music swells and we see a range of emotion play out on her face...it's unreal.\n\nThis film was beautiful, and everyone should really do their best to experience it.", "This is one of those amazing films where I thought it was okay but then the more I thought about it the more scenes just kept replaying in my mind and now I love it. The image of the faceless portrait, burning from the heart. The musical chant and the fiery dress. The haunting image of Heloise in her wedding dress. The tender kiss.\n\nOf course the best thing is the way the film pays off so brilliantly in the final two scenes. I can't believe a page number in a portrait could make me cry but the film has earned that brilliant catharsis. And of course the final shot, insanely acted by  Ad\u00e8le Haenel but also a beautiful portrait of the way art that has informed our lives changes the way we interact with it.\n\nGoddamn what an incredible movie.", "I absolutely love how every single frame of this film looks like it could be a painting. Sciamma has an amazing eye for that.", "When we were zoomed in on Heloise at the end I half expected Visions of Gideon to start playing. Like yeah queer movie where they don\u2019t end up together but same guy punch that hurts so good", "France really fucked themselves over by not submitting this for Best International Feature. It's far superior to Les Miserables and I think would have been a worthy rival to Parasite.\n\nGorgeous film through and through. Beautifully somber, subtle screenplay about forbidden love.

There were several times where I think I just straight up stopped breathing.", "They just gave the Cesar to Polanski instead of Sciamma. End me.", "Other than the love story, which was very delicately handled and portrayed, I really liked how the movie depicted female friendship, or rather closeness. \n\nWhen the mother leaves, the young mistress, the hired painter and the servant remain alone in the big mansion and it\u2019s like a veil is lifted from all their lives. The class bonds sort of dissipate and they eat together, work and sew together, move freely, the two upper-class women go out of their way to assist the lowly girl when she needs help. \n\nI think it\u2019s a huge credit to Sciamma that this shift looks natural instead of far-fetched, warm and powerful but without any contrived YAY SISTERHOOD vibes.", "I had a strong initial reaction that Celine Sciamma made a mistake with the ending. I really believed she should have cut the movie off after Marianne turns around. So many movies seem to meander and linger long after the emotional weight of the climax has completely dissipated. The Coen Brothers often feel like the only directors that understand abrupt endings are incredibly powerful if done right.\n\n Seeing the movie again I now realize that reaction was wrong and bad and Sciamma is smarter and a much better writer than I am.", "I don't know how to properly explain this and I wonder how many of you felt the same - this is by far the sexiest movie that I have seen that didn't portray women as sex objects. You have these undeniably attractive women doing extremely erotic things and yet I never looked at them thinking - \"Yeah, this is meant to activate my pleasure centers\". Even though reading the screenplay I probably wouldn't have had the same reaction. So congratulations to Sciamma for being able to showcase romance in that way - she rewired my male brain, at least for two hours.\n\nAlso one of the best looking movies I've seen - puts other movies to shame.", "Just finished watching, and I'm honestly speechless at the beauty of this film.  On the technical side, the cinematography was stunning.  There was hardly a scene that I wouldn't feel happy to print and have hanging on my wall.  Just amazing.\n\nThe story itself was beautifully constructed, I felt like the slower pace and limited dialogue added so much to the story.  I still have to take more time to fully process, but I was deeply moved by the portrayal of friendship, love, heartbreak.  Seeing the 28 in the portrait in the gallery definitely opened up the tears for me, and the final scene in the theater broke open the dam.  I think that H\u00e9lo\u00efse didn't see Marianne, but through the music, she felt Marianne still with her.  That definitely struck a deep cord, bringing back memories of people since gone from my life.  Huge props to Ad\u00e8le and No\u00e9mie for those stunning performances as well.\n\nCould be some recency bias, but I don't think I'm wrong in saying that this film is a true masterpiece and sits well within my top 5 favorites of all time.

So many romance films just throw shit at the wall and hope people relate to what the actors are reading off the page. \n\n\nSeldom do the *artists*, which is what the actresses in this film are in the truest sense of the word, of a film create such a level of intimacy, such a burning passion between two individuals madly and fiercely in love and lust with one another to create a world so small, so delicate, so intimate. The strongest stars burn brightest and shortest. The truth of the passion in this story is painted across each frame of film reel, each glance between our two protagonists.  \n\n\n\nNot to say much about the social commentary that is the true catalyst of this film. This is a classic romance, a classic commentary, a film *anyone* can slide into and remember something lost within their own lives, and how society hinders the expression of ourselves and our desires, our personal truths. \n\n\nThe film was also ASMR dream-heaven. Sound was as much a player in this intimacy as the acting, the story, the environment created by the camera. Without the sound production, there is nothing.

I became so locked into that last shot, that at some point I had gotten tunnel vision and I realized I wasn\u2019t breathing.

Complete and devastating silence resonated in my ears and when the credits finally appeared, I broke down. I\u2019m a straight male, and I never felt anything like that before.

A masterpiece.", "This film feels like magic. Extremely affecting. Stopped my breath many times. I could feel it pulling ever closer to that first kiss and it just ran right over me and left me staggering. That final shot is one of the most powerful and empathetic statements of love's enduring state. The way it withholds music entirely except for 2 (kind of 3) propulsive moments was so impressive. I even thought Sophie's small plot line with the abortion was done very well. The conclusion of that was tasteful and also deeply affecting. I just cannot believe I saw this film, I will never forget it.", "Saw this at TIFF back in September   \n\n\nWow. This was really beautiful.

I've seen a bunch of films but never quite something like this one, it's almost as if I got dumped. In a good way?\n\nThe reason I like this film so much is because of the completely pure romance between the two characters. It transcends gender, so it doesn't feel tied to any of that; it's just love in its purest form, made impossible by society and it's traditions. \n\n>!Not only that, but the way that the film had constantly been suggesting that we probably won't get the ending we hoped for but we still kept on hoping. Like H\u00e9lo\u00efse and Marianne cannot have their love, we cannot have the feel-good ending.

Sparse yet stunning, from the cliffs to the Chateau, it was all a joy to see and soak in.- It goes without saying that the performances were memorable. Adele Haenel especially was a tour de force. She has the simmering energy that is just bursting to come out, and when it does its mesmerizing. Merlant was great as well, the two had some truly eye opening chemistry.- The camera work in this movie was some of the most intimate I've ever seen. Close and personal but never gratuitous or excessive. The last half hour or so had some of the best framing and angles I think I've ever seen. It contributed big time to how memorable the picture was for me.- The image of Heloise on fire at the bonfire is one of the most visually arresting images in recent cinema history. The painting at the beginning was also quite striking, I was hoping we could have seen more of it!- The abortion scene and the contrasting life and death in the same frame was quite the balance. It reminded me for some reason of one of my favorite movies of all time: The Tree of Life.- The page 28 scene at the end...man...It simultaneously destroyed me and brought me great joy. And then that last scene, the music, her expression, the cut, my god. Just absolute perfection.", "Why this movie didn't win an Oscar", "France fucked up by not having this as their nominee. This is the only one that could've competed with Parasite", "The bonfire scene and song was spectacular. I loved how the camera is *so close* to the faces of the addresses, especially Heloise.

I felt the slow pace a couple times but the performances kept me engaged, I really connected with the characters and their struggle. I was thrown off at first by all the long shots on someone's face, but by the end I really appreciated how resonate it was with the themes and painting story in the movie.\n\nThe film was good not great for me until the final 15 minutes or so. What a whirlwind of emotions. There were audible gasps in the theater (including my own) for the brief shot of Heloise with the white dress, that was probably the most powerful shot of the movie for me. The next two \"endings\" really hit me like a ton of bricks, I was so invested in their relationship by that point. 8/10\n\nI had a question for Reddit about how the Orpheus story relates to these two women. Marianne says she understand's Orpheus's decision as \"the poet's choice\" as opposed to the \"lover's choice\".

I'm with the Sophie here, why wouldn't not looking back be the clear answer?", "In this film, every frame is a painting. Beautifully shot and acted, this is an exercise in restrain with dialogues and music sparingly but effectively used. The movies slow pace isn't for everyone but I believe that if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with a great commentary on patriarchy, love and passion. \n\nI remember there was a lot of discussion about female vs male gaze when this movie was released and I would agree this movie could not have been made by a man.The most obvious example being th sex scenes while not shying away from nudity are never explicit and the focus is always on the moments of intimacy rather than depicting sex graphically. Men are almost absent from the film. It's all about four women with both the leads Noemi Merlant and Adele Haenel having great chemistry and supported wonderfully by Luana Bajrami , her abortion story was heartbreaking and a well acted by her. The movie while commenting on forbidden love and patriarchy never becomes preachy or tries to conform to today's standards of feminism, it's real to the end.\n\nSpecial mention to the  last 15-20 minutes which just  blew my breath away and took the movie to another level.\n\nIt's a near perfect film.\n9/10.", "I really love and hate this movie at the same time, most beautiful knife that stabbed my heart.\nSince now, i won't feel happy when I'm listening vivaldi.", "Felt like I was watching a painting", "Watched it yesterday. it was a bittersweet and a bit heartbreaking movie, especially the ending. The acting was amazing, I now have a crush on Adele Haenel/Helo\u00efse). The filming was also amazing. the storyline was good. I like vague and ambiguous and symbolic movies like this. I wish they resisted and could end up together, but they didn't. but at least they never forgot eachother. p.28 portrait and vivaldi were good evidences for that. most of the lesbian love movies are made up, fake and extreme, but this one was a gem! the ending was so meaningful. 8/10", "[deleted]", "It burns so bad, i wish I've never watched it", "Why didn't Marianne paint the 2nd portrait?\n\nWhy couldn't they continue seeing each other and just pretend to be friends?", "This film has taken a permanent place in me - I cannot fathom how beautiful this is. When H\u00e9lo\u00efse stares away at the orchestra in the end (which is playing the same piece as Marianne does earlier on a harpsichord), the film took a major leap in the history of storytelling for me. \n\nMarianne turning back & becoming Orpheus, choosing the poet over the lover, H\u00e9lo\u00efse holding on to page no.28 years later on a portrait with her child, Sophie holding the infant's hand tightly as they abort her child, the portrait of H\u00e9lo\u00efse on fire in the classroom - I believe this film has given such incredible moments to the history of cinema altogether. \n\nOne of the biggest winners for me was the screenplay which like the film's nature itself evolves slowly almost like a fire's rising flame.

Still, it's playing in major movie theaters near me and I think/hope that after Parasite hype, people who don't generally see foreign films may actually go out and see this one.\n\nThe two leads are stunning, and so lovely together. Funny when Heloise asks Marianne to guess when she first wanted to kiss her, because there were plenty of times before the first kiss where I thought to myself *oh man they're gonna kiss*.

The cinematography is slow and delicate yet entrancing. This movie was shot in 7K, and this just adds to the sharp look of the movie. I've been going overboard with the adjectives, but I don't think words can describe how beautiful this movie looks.\u00a0\n\nJust as good as the visuals is the acting by the two main actors: No\u00e9mie Merlant and Ad\u00e8le Haenel. They deliver subtle yet powerful performances, selling their circumstances and journey into a relationship through body language, facial expression, and minimal dialogue\n\nThe relationship despite being at the forefront of the movie, never undercuts any of the other themes or sub-plots in the movie. In fact, the theme of sisterhood is beautifully conveyed.\u00a0\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece and I absolutely love this movie, and one I will continue to revisit.

I was hooked from the beginning and I did not expect to stay hooked the whole way through but I never looked away. Last week I saw Sonic the Hedgehog, and, I know, completely different movie for a completely different purpose, but you judge a movie like that on whether it can satisfactorily meet the threshold of competency (it didn't). But then this week I see Portrait, and not only is crafted so well, it is layered with themes and emotions, and I am just so impressed. This is what cinema can be. It's not necessarily the genre that I relate to the most, but I admire everything about this movie. Fantastic.", "God what a beautiful movie. Everything felt so detailed and full from the acting to the writing. The ending left me close to tears and my wife burst out crying and she does NOT get emotional from movies.

A ghost, an angel?\n\nI\u2019m assuming when Marianne sees the portrait of her and H\u00e9lo\u00efse, she\u2019s posing with her daughter. So she got married to the Milanese man and got a portrait by another painter years later, while referencing page 28 for Marianne. Did she know this portrait was going to be seen by her, or was this just to show she never fully moved on?\n\nAnd finally, what were they rubbing on their armpits to get high?

One of the most powerful films I've seen in years. I wish I knew more about the story of Orpheus and Eurydice prior to seeing it, but was still very much able to relate the ancient tale we're given with the one we're seeing unfold. \"She always walks in front of me.\" \n\nAlso, while it's pretty obvious that they're going to end up romantically involved, the scenes where their advances were slowly getting more overt were still so tense. Culminating in that final scene... My god was that breath taking.\n\nSuch a special film. The romance felt so natural. Will be seeing it again immediately.", "I watched this film for four times until now. Three times in movie theater. Every time I watched it I can obtain new feelings and understanding. It\u2019s not just about love, not a portrait of a lady, but a portrait of women\u2019s life and choice. They seems like no choice and be pressed by the patriarchy, but meanwhile they\u2019re the heroes of their own lives. Even if the destiny cannot be escaped, they still chose to love. I could feel the strength of these women, that makes me feel that it\u2019s not a tragedy. They lived.", "There's something so bitterly beautiful about love so intense, but cannot be. Similar to Call Me by Your Name, the love between the two mains characters is so palpable and visceral you can't help but feel what they're feeling. The immense burning love they share, and the devastating heart brake. The symbolism and cinematography in this movie were phenomenal. Again, I compare to CMbYN,; not because they're both gay love movies, but because they're both amazing movies about love, especially forbidden love. Both movies are able to be tastefully erotic, real love, and sex is not like porn, both movies portray just how sexy passionate love making can be. Wonderfully crafted films, both of them.", "Wow. WOW this movie. \n\nSaw this tonight and am absolutely stunned, shook, and blown away. What a beautiful beautiful film. Easily the most intimate movie I've ever seen, to the point where I feel like I've loved and lost alongside the characters. I went into this film having only seen the trailer and read nothing, and left with a new all time favorite. I'm going to be thinking about this film forever, and I'm really grateful to have experienced it.", "Tied with Marrige Story for my favorite movie of 2019. I liked it more than Parasite, but thats with my own personal biases.", "It's just the most stunning film. Stands alongside, probably above, Parasite as the best film of the past year for me. Every year there's a select few films that strike me as all time classics in waiting, and I think this is one of them. The last year has been a year of superb cinema, but this is just the most breathtaking and beautiful of the bunch. It's small and intimate but made for the biggest screen and best speakers possible too. The performances and the script are immense. I couldn't possibly recommend a film more.", "2 things I've wondered about since seeing this film a couple months ago, might be obvious but just to clarify.\n\n1. Throughout the film Marianne seems to see a vision of Heloise in her wedding dress. I think it happens maybe 3 times. Does this just represent how Heloise getting married soon looms over Marianne? Even though she is in love with her, are these the moments where she briefly remembers that it won't last forever and one day Heloise won't be hers anymore, but stuck with someone else? So the image/idea basically haunts her? Heloise and the atmosphere of those scenes make it seem so ghostly, I just wonder if I had missed its deeper meaning.\n2. At the end when Marianne sees Heloise a the orchestra, Heloise is crying and unraveling, but she never turns to look back at her. At first I just thought it was because Heloise didn't know she was there, but then I remembered when they bring up the story where the man refuses to look at the woman he loves/loved because he'd rather live on with the memories they shared or the thought of her (something like that) rather than see her again and reignite those old feelings and cherishing her in his memory. I'm butchering what story they talk about, as it's been a while, but is that why she is crying/not looking at her, rather than just being upset with her current life? Or is the orchestra the only place loud/private enough that it's the only time Heloise can let out her emotions?", "I made a post over in /r/DoubleFeatures that pairs this with High Art (1998). There are superficial similarities in the subject, particularly with the focus on portraits as the art subject, but mostly, I went in wondering if I was going to get a similar tragic love story (because it wasn't a 90s queer film if there wasn't some kind of tragedy attached). I was pleasantly surprised by the underlying sweetness to the movie, that left room for feeling the heartbreak without some ugly unexpected confrontation.", "I can't draw for shit but this film made me want to start painting.", "for being similar to Call me by your name, I did find CMBYN to be more emotional (you can thank Sufjan for that) but as I also expect this film feel more subtle yet hitting very hard though that also mean I didn't completely get the film\n\nit gonna stay with me for a while and I can only expect it to get better when rewatching", "Just watched it yesterday after 2-3 weeks of desperately avoiding spoilers on Tumblr, and though I wish it had an intrigue, I guess the Lesbian Yearning\u2122 makes up for it. My favorite aspect of the movie is the acting and camerawork, particularly the focus on intimate body language (hands, looks, profiles, etc.). I couldn't relate to it much personally but I'm hoping to see more historical lesbian movies directed by women in the future.", "Brilliant and beautiful work. In the same genre, I would personally peg it a bit higher than Call Me By Your Name", "What was the point of them taking drugs? Just for that finger fakeout?

I honestly found a lot of the dialogue very stilted and I didn\u2019t really buy the relationship between these two women at all. The audience were giggling at some of the line deliveries and long stares between them.\n\nIt\u2019s not badly shot or acted, but I found the story so disinteresting that the ending didn\u2019t do anything for me at all. In fact, some audiences found it hilarious. Guess it\u2019s just one of those movies I\u2019ll never get the praise for and have to keep telling myself it\u2019s okay to not love a universally praised movie. 4/10", "I found this film to be very disappointing.\n\nDisappointing with how conventional it ended up being. Disappointing with how unoriginal it was in its plotting. Disappointing with how literal it was in its interpretation of \"lady on fire\". And disappointing with how it veered away from its potentially intriguing setup of a painter disguised as a walking partner and went full bore into sappy romantic gay cliches of how these two were exploring a forbidden love. Not like we haven't seen this before, and done better.\n\nThere were also a lot of critiques about society that were shoehorned into the plotting of this movie. Themes about abortions, involuntary pregnancies, rape, and suicide were touched on, but failed to percolate and provide structure to the thesis.\n\nThe symbolism and metaphors the film uses to attempt to elevate these themes into grandiose talking points end up falling way short due to how mixed their messages are. For example, the impromptu painting of Heloise reaching up another Sophie's skirt as she lay on her back isn't clear about its intention (is it a reference about induced abortions, or is it a reference about forbidden lovers experimenting with gay sex?). Another example is the pendant with which Marianne has a picture of Heloise; she says it's a token to remember the Heloise by, but that viewpoint is cancelled out when Marianne specifically says she only saw her long lost love two other times in her life......well, wouldn't she technically see her everytime she looks at her pendant......meaning the significance of the pendant becomes moot. Then there was the apparition of Heloise coming into view dressed in white gowning. Is this meant to signify Heloises purity and inability of Marianne to see her as within her league, or is it meant to foreshadow the inevitable marriage she is meant to have with a man she does not love?\n\nThe movie also fails to make it clear whether these women were bisexual or strictly gay, which in my opinion is crucial to interest of the love story.\n\nI must admit the scenery was breathtaking and the suspense was inviting (like wondering if Heloise will wake up before Marianne finishes drawing her).\n\nFor me, the drama was desultory and uncompelling.", "I consider myself an art film lover and being a gay man I was excited for this, but damn, I did not connect with it at all. Fell asleep the first time and had to continue the following day. I hate that I didn't like it but it was so boring and uninteresting to me. Great and acting and cinematography, though.", "I saw this a little back (before the quarantining) in a theater and while it was gorgeous, I really was disappointed. Maybe it was a case of really high expectations, but I just didn't connect. I thought it was slow-paced but, perhaps more importantly, it felt like a slow pace which I didn't think suited the plot at all. I found it hard to buy into the central relationship with the slow-paced start and I feel like the melodramatic plot isn't really anything new. Idk, just wasn't for me, I couldn't stop thinking about CMBYN and how I'd rather have been watching that. Or The Handmaiden. But I'd rather be watching The Handmaiden than doing literally anything else.", "Well I was not impressed.\n\nIt's a nice period drama with beautiful costumes, light, scenery, hair and makeup. I liked it more than the new Little Women. I didn't find it slow or anything. I thought the pacing was swift and I didn't get bored.\n\nHowever, it's just so predictable. This is a straightforward star crossed lovers where you expect them to share a couple nights of passion and then go their separate ways because one has to marry. I felt like I've seen that story before. Especially that ending of only having the memory and feeling sad, it felt very already done. I wasn't blown away by the line delivery either. A lot of the emotion felt forced. They've only known each other for a few days so how can they be talking about love? It's just a hookup, it's not as deep as they are trying to make it. I might have bought it if they knew each other longer. I think they cast the perfect actresses, it's just the script didn't ring authentic to me. I saw it in French and I speak French, in case that changes anything.\n\nI did like the page 28 and the final scene watching the orchestral version of the song she played, and I liked the character of the painter who had a singular life.", "One of the most quietly affecting but somehow intense films I've seen in ages. Absolutely gorgeous with strong performances and sharp, natural writing. I was in awe the length of the film, becoming deeply entranced with the women and their lives and world. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so glad the ruse of the painting was dropped very early on, really allowed the movie to open up.", "This film. \n\nI saw it back in September, then again in November and again last week. \n\nIt's just so good, it keeps me coming back for that familiar heartache. \n\nOne of the most powerful endings I have ever seen.", "Great movie. One of the most impressive ending I'v ever seen.\n\nBut recreating abortion scene for drawing felt too on the nose. I think director wants to make three women's bond stronger through it, but there must be better ways to do that.", "It had a nice, poetic screenplay but, boy, it sure was slow... and there wasn't anything profound or new to me. And don't come at me with \"stick to Transformers\" and shit like that. I am a **huge** fan of slow-burners.

Most women I know have had a stalker at some point (I had two when I was a kid), and this totally captures the fear, dread, mind-games and gaslighting the experience can have. The true horror wasn't even the big flashy things - it was an e-mail sent in your name that attacked the bonds you had with your family, putting the lives of people who reach out to help you at risk so you self-isolate, it was the way your attacker obsesses over an idea of possessing you - very, very good.\n\nAnd I have to say, strangely accurate to the Wells book.

The camera work was nothing short of genius. The way the camera will deliberately move to show seemingly empty space really puts the viewer in the mind of the character. The camera is pointed at an empty corner, and we can see that there's nothing there, but why are we seeing it if there's nothing there? At one point, the camera *rack focuses to nothing*, and it's brilliant.\n\nThe last act was really something else. I loved how the movie was willing to have fun enough to give the Invisible Man a Marvel-style hallway fight, just to show how OP invisibility would be even in straight combat.\n\nOh yeah, and Elizabeth Moss was incredible, and she carries the film, put Elizabeth Moss in more things.\n\nThat said, there are some glaring flaws. Cecilia's sister gets a weird e-mail that Cecilia denies sending, and she immediately cuts ties to her? That's not how sisters work. Like, I buy that the sister would be upset by the e-mail, but it would be \"Hey, what the fuck is up with this e-mail?\" \"I didn't send that.\" \"Okay, didn't think so. Change your password.\" And don't tell me their relationship wasn't that good. The sister drove out into the middle of nowhere at 4am with no context to pick Cecilia up. *That's* what sisters do. Leigh Whannell is an only child.\n\nThe character of Tom really seemed to convolute the story, and also cheapen the core idea a little bit.

He definitely killed himself, no need to investigate or nothing. Also, his girlfriend is clearly crazy because she says he's invisible and is stalking her. As if anybody is crazy enough to believe the genius engineer in the field of optics who's basement is full of suits that make you invisible -which there is zero chance nobody knew about- could somehow turn invisible. Oh wait, nevermind, he was alive the whole time and his *brother* somehow built an invisibility suit, unconnected to aforementioned invisibility suits. So he's fine and off the hook for the Invisible Crimes and no further investigation is need.\"\n\nAlso Aldis Hodge looks like somebody gave steroids to a monster truck.

I was hoping for more.\n\n8/10", "To me the reason why this film is so captivating and terrifying is not due to having an antagonist wearing an invisible suit, but due the fact that it depicts an abusive relationship quite accurately. Cecilia was gaslighted, isolated, constantly put under both emotional and physical pressure while seemingly without ways to escape her abuser; the above description can be used to describe many real life scenarios regarding the relationship between victims of abuse and their abusers. \n\nWhen I was watching the film, I wasn't focused on the sci fi and physical violence aspects of horror, but I was way more affected by the cognitive empathy I had for Cecilia herself. Unlike many horror movies where the struggle of the characters appears to be out of this world and completely removed from reality, Cecilia's torment seems to be so realistic and can be experienced by anyone, including ourselves and those that are close to us. \n\nI don't simply view Adrian as a man in an invisible suit, but the manifestation of the violence and threat that loom over victims of abuse. Even without a suit of invisibility, the abuser can still have the same type of control and adverse effects  on the victims; what the movie did was to simply amplify the effect and the stake by adding in an element of science fiction. To me, the appeal of the film is about how realistic it is, and how the superpowered suit and excessive violence did not derail the realistic depiction of a violent and abusive relationship, which is a type of terror that exists around us.", "Wait, so this is actually good?\n\nThis was *not* what I expected when I opened this thread.", "Does this man not eat/sleep/poop?!

There were two killers, Adrian and his brother. Moss killed Adrian. The end.", "2 Easter Eggs that stood out to me in this film:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Cecilia calls Tom a jellyfish due to his \"lack of a spine\". When Sydney is being attacked by the invisible man, she has a jellyfish on her shirt (as likened to Zora having a rabbit on her shirt in Us) which immediately led me to believe Tom was in fact attacking her and James.\n2. When Cecilia is in the hospital, she sees a man covered in bandages being whisked away on a gurney, which I believe is a nod to the 1933 original.", "The only thing I didn't understand was after her sister's murder in the restaurant... wouldn't the cops ask for video footage from the restaurant to see exactly what happened? Any detectives who know what they're doing would ask to see evidence. Maybe Tom tampered with the security cameras before or after the fact, but the film didn't show that, so the audience is just left to assume that video footage still existed. So essentially they were just going off the idea that Cecilia sent her sister an email saying she wanted to kill her, and she was holding a knife at the restaurant after her sister's throat was slit, and so she must be the murderer.\n\nUm, maybe look at the security cameras to make sure? Policing 101 here.", "The score was bloody amazing! Every scene was elevated so damn much by the music accompanying it. And Moss\u2019 performance was great. Loved her dynamic with the husband.", "It\u2019s funny how everyone keeps talking about how great the second half is , I actually loved the first half more.

Thought it was great. Never had any doubt in Leigh Whannell to be honest but glad I didn't watch anything more than the teaser. Even it gave away too much.    \n\nI liked the modern grounded take on the indivisibility. I am so sick of brilliant scientist turned mad because of some experiment like hollow man. I liked that it was >!tech!< that made the invisible man.     \n\nI also enjoyed that it wasn't voyeuristic or sleazy, like Hollow Man was. Which is a good movie in its own right. But I like that this is a story of abuse and gaslighting told fairly straight. Its very easy with invisible man stories to play into the voyeuristic fantasy so I like that this went more of the traditional thriller/horror route with it. In fact the movie mostly could still work if you take away the invisibility aspect. An obsessive ex boyfriend with a lot of money could probably still mess her life up just as much.     \n\nElizabeth Moss was terrific, that girl can play crazy.     \n\nI loved the wide angle shots, I was so anxious just waiting for something to move or give us a sign he was there.    \n\n>!Also great use of \"show, don't tell\". Leigh Whannell trusted the audience to \"get\" the tech in it. We didn't get some big exposition scene explaining how the invisibility worked. We see a brief pan of his workshop in the opening, which shows us he is building something and then when it is finally revealed its done so in a way to simply convey to the audience how it works. I loved that. I wish more movies would do this. Not everything has to be spelt out for us. It was beautiful.!<    \n\nIt's not a perfect film, and super easy to poke holes in but it's a movie about an invisible man. You have to let things slide.", "I liked the foreshadowing near the end.

Right before she got attacked by Tom.", "Dog:  Why am I in this movie?", "Is this the best horror movie this year so far?\n\nThe score and suit design is amazing, and of course Moss\u2019 acting is really good\n\nAnd does anyone else realised that Adrian\u2019s house didnt have doors?", "Man, this movie was really good. Just super tight. Intense, scary, timely, psychological, really well shot and acted. I had heard it was quite good and I was still pretty surprised. \n\nMoss puts forward a hell of a performance. Considering half the movie is her reacting to negative space she is really carrying this thing on her shoulders and it looks pretty effortless.\n\n I appreciated how right off the bat in the first scene, her entire plan relies on being able to see him with her camera. We are instantly told how dangerous he is and the focus of the ability to see him without him doing anything. \n\nReally enjoyed the way of framing the story of the invisible Man as an abusive narcissist. Super frightening to imagine what such an intelligent abuser could do if they terrorize a single person. The ways he compartmentalized her from her family and friends, set her up to be framed. Absolutely frightening when he killed her sister, kind of a moment where you realize she's really helpless and totally fucked. \n\nI loved the camera work. It focused on the negative space in such a great way that the scenes were all suspenseful even if there was nothing on screen to make it so. Really impressive to craft so many scenes where the same thing is happening and make them each unique and scary. \n\nI was really happy with the ending. I know it kind of turns into a revenge thriller, but so much of the movie felt so helpless that I honestly thought she was gonna give him his final fuck you through suicide. Even after she was out of the hospital and he's still controlling the narrative. I liked how he never actually admitted it was him. It leaves a bit of doubt in the cop character but and forces him to ask himself is he believes her. \n\nAnd that's what this is all about. We see that she's telling the truth but imagine being in such a mental prison that no one would even believe you. That your abuser is walking free in daylight and no one will just give you the benefit of the doubt. The themes were so well portrayed I would almost consider this more of a drama than a horror. \n\nEasy 8/10. High quality stuff, would recommend.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "This movie\u2019s great?

The pepper spray scenes got a lot of laughs in the theater I was in.\n\nThe portrayal of abuse and gaslighting was honestly too realistic for me in certain scenes and I loved that they never explicitly showed what happened to Moss before she left.

They would have clearly seen the knife floating in the air and killing the sister while she stands still.\n\nAt least if they mentioned the place had no cameras I would have been satisfied, but after that it\u2019s all I could think about.\n\nDefinitely one of the more creative horror movies in a long time, I\u2019d definitely recommend it.", "Sci-fi horror is such an amazing genre", "I'm genuinely surprised at the number of people asking \"who else saw him take the knife?\" Like, it happened as clear as day in a well-lit kitchen, where were people focusing if not on that?", "Step 1: Sell complete optical invisibility to the government\n\nStep 2: change literally the entire world\n\nStep 3: become trillionaire, maybe multi-trillionaire\n\nStep 4: buy small country and brutalize the populace as an absolute dictator.\n\nStep 5: Get over your ex.", "Loved most of the movie but the sister annoyed the living hell out of me, first when they were in the car and a fucking dude from the woods start slamming it, what does she do? She asks more useless questions....like fucking GET AWAY FROM THERE.\nThen the email part, here they both annoyed me, cecilia seemed like she couldn't fucking talk and explain what happened like a normal human being while her sister just belived a random email without questioning it enough......I felt bad when she died, for cecilia.

All of the ladies in the theater said \"DAMN\" at the exact same time.", "Okay so I really liked the movie a lot but some things irritated me.\n\n1. Her sister and her were obviously close that's why she drove out to the middle of nowhere in the middle of night to pick her up. Yet she was so shocked by that email instead of asking her what that was about she just said she needed medication.\n\n\n2. Wouldn't there have been camera footage at the restaurant? It looked pretty high class and that cop got there SUPER quick. Almost like he was eating at a nearby table.\n\n\n3. How did she pepper pray him through the suit?\n\n\n4. I am surprised Adrian wiped paint off his suit in like .5 seconds. And why wouldn't the cop check the attic when he got home and saw paint all over his floor, a ladder, and his attic open?\n\n\n5. If they found him locked in his basement, they would have investigated the fake suicide. But they just glossed over that and he got cleaned up and got his house ready for his bae.\n\n\n6.

Like, it's like people didn't even watch it.\n\nThe suit obviously gave the wearer extra strength. Adrian lifted a full-grown woman several feet off the ground with one hand. He knocked out full grown-men with one punch. The fact that Cecilia could use the suit to overpower him at the end makes perfect sense.\n\nThe dog surviving? Clearly Adrian and Tom were both still around and in the house. They could easily feed a dog. And It's a house in the middle of nowhere with a goddamn wall protecting it. No one's gonna just stumble in and see a dog. \n\nAdrian seemed nice at the end and not at all like she described him (for example letting her decide what to eat). Yeah, no shit. That's textbook abusive behavior. He wants her back, so he pretends to be a changed man.", "The restaurant kill is an all timer of a jump scare. \n\nThe movie is fun. I do think there\u2019s too much you\u2019re asked to buy as an audience member but nothing to the point that it breaks the movie.

Like, it's obvious he wasnt alone.", "Up until the end i'd rate it maybe 8/10. Some questionable moments, like washing paint off your high tech suit with water, but i can get past it. \n\nThen the ending happened. I fucking hated the ending.\n\nThe whole movie all we hear about Adrian is that he's smart and manipulative and controlling and violent and cold and horrible. He's apparently been controlling what Cecilia can do and say, and is horribly abusive. He punched through a car window when she ran away, so ya we can assume he might be violent.\n\nThen the movie ends with Cecilia trying to force Adrian to say something that may well not be true as far as we know, and when he doesn't she kills him, fake cries for a camera and then coldly stares as him while he dies.\n\nI immediately lost all sympathy for her. I know the movie was trying to show that he's not overtly abusive, but he knows what to say and do to make her behave how he wants her to and was trying to take control again. Problem is, telling someone you're not a murderer and comforting them when they get upset is not abusive, even if you do put your hand on their knee and say \"surprise\" in a sentence. Whereas Cecilia embodied everything she claimed Adrian to be in that scene.\n\nI was ready for either a full confession and violent outbreak from Adrian, or for Cecilia to be so traumatized by events that she can't let go of the idea that Adrian is behind everything bad that happens to her even though she can't prove it. Instead it's revealed that Cecilia is a very cold person and a convincing liar. She's a psychopath. It left me questioning her character, and wondering if she was lying about the abuse the entire time. All the while the camera is holding on her trying to look vindicated, like she's the hero in spite of what just happened.", "Loved the movie.  Was REALLY annoyed all the stupid drivers in this movie:\n\nCecilia: \"DRIVE! GO!\"  \nSister: Huh? What?  I don't understand your urgency when I already came out in the middle of the road to pick you up at night.Cecilia: GOOOO FUCKING GOOOOOOO  \nSister: Okay, I stopped in this road, but apparently the car is in park.

Totally blown away by how good this was. I hope Bloomhouse tackles all of the Universal Monsters if this is how they plan on adapting them.\n\nThis was unbearably tense at points. I loved how the movie feels like it's backing you into a corner. In many horror movies I find myself wondering why the main characters don't just do this or that. Not here. The level of gaslighting and mental torture Cecillia goes through just makes you want to throw your hands up at some point and give up.\n\nAs many have said the sister restaurant scene was the highlight and Elisabeth Moss killed it.", "The ending was fantastic.

Only issue I had was it felt about 15 minutes too long, I think keeping the suspense going would\u2019ve been a little more impactful, but I totally see why the director chose to end it the way he did. Direction was really good and nuanced in this and Moss was terrific. Sound design and music both helped the film and were used appropriately. Hope to see more of these types of films from him as I really enjoyed Upgrade as well.", "I think this film was great for the depiction of ptsd after leaving an abusive relationship. The feelings and sensations she\u2019s going through (up until he punches Sydney) are so completely relatable.\n\nThere is a mental hold and you feel like their presence is inescapable. You\u2019re super isolated (because they made you that way) you\u2019re going to have night terrors that are hard to wake up from. It\u2019s incredibly hard to shake the feeling that they\u2019re right there watching you, laughing at you. \n\nThe dark universe aside, I hope this spurs conversations about domestic abuse survivors. It is a hard and messy process to come back from. \n\nVery surprised the sister wasn\u2019t more aware of it and more supportive. She was late showing up with the car? Like come on.", "Very fun movie, the first half is a master class in tension building, especially considering how much of it was just good camera work.\n\nMy only gripe would be the hallway scene where he kills like 5 guards. It felt like I was taken out of a tense horror/thriller and dropped into a Marvel movie where they were introducing the main villain. I wish that his kills and violence were more manipulation/sneaky based as to match his entire characterization better.", "Man, ain't no way her hair, clothes, and makeup were perfect after taking off the suit in a rush.", "Absolutely brilliant stuff. I was keen to see this but also doubtful from the trailer, nervous it'd be some hammed up horror shit that we've seen fail so many times but I was hooked just from the glimpses of Moss' acting.\n\nJust came back from seeing it and my god...blew me away! Her acting alone...just beyond words.\n\nThe score was incredible. The paint scene got me so badly because this sense of sudden doom around it; it wasn't a jump scare, just this awful, sudden sense of panic seeing how close he was to her and the music that boomed.\n\nThis movie was tense from the very opening scene of her rushing around his house in silent terror until the very end. Seeing her get her power back. \n\nJust overall such a great film, looking forward a rewatch already...the hopelessness you felt for her and my god, the dinner scene...\n\n\nMy local theater is notorious for having shitty people in there laughing and joking, but we risked going just praying they'd be quiet lol....the cinema was packed and yet you could've heard a pin drop during the entire thing, the tension there was palpable.\n\nAnd then a guy behind me shrieked like a little child at one scene and everyone burst out laughing at him which actually eased the tension for just a few seconds lol", "One thing I loved is when she finds out she\u2019s pregnant. Really gets your mind wondering.

No calling other friends or family members to confirm it.", "Just watched this today, did anyone else notice when cee uses her pepper spray you see either Tom or Adrian stumble into the dresser and as soon as Cee run out of her bedroom she gets hit backwards while running down the corridor and clutches at her chest suggesting it was impact from the front. Clearly they were both there, he must have had more than 2 suits.", "Trypophobia warning", "The level of hopelessness the character is in is more terrifying than whatever else a horror movie could throw at you. Tense and gripping. Such smart filmmaking too with the low but perfectly used budget and the obvious brilliant idea of setting this in the context of a woman being stalked by an abusive lover. Just brilliant and really well done all around. Elizabeth Moss keeps knocking it out of the park. (Watch Her Smell if you haven't.)\n\nThose lingering pan shots of *nothing* had me almost laughing out loud at how the movie can be so tense and give the viewer so much anxiety while spending virtually no money and being so much more effective than most other similar films out there. I'm guessing this kind of comment is played out by now and I expected something like this but they really took it to the extreme and it absolutely worked the whole way through.", "The ending would have been 1000% better if it turned out that someone else had killed him, we never find out who, and there's just an invisible psycho out there now and nobody has any idea how to deal with it.", "Anyone see the homage to the original invisible man getup when they wheel the dude out of the intensive care unit in the bandages?

You get a general sense that they're on rocky terms, but no clear indication as to why. But apparently things were bad enough between them for her sister to read an email full of hate and vitriol and just accept that she wrote it, even when she says she didn't. It's like a half hour was cut from the beginning where the movie shows us how they met, how bad he became, and how it affected her relationship with her sister to such a degree.

I've seen this asked a bunch so I'll lay it out first. Anyone wondering if it's like **Mandy**? No, it's not. It's a more conventional horror movie structure, not stylistic or atmospheric like Panos Cosmatos. It goes slow burn and slowly grows in insanity.

When I realised what I was seeing with the mum and son I scream-gasped out of shock and the buildup and reveal of the alpacas was the most tense I've felt at a horror movie maybe ever.

Before I piss people off for having an opinion, I will say this movie did do some things right. The high pitched sound was really effective use of sound and the practical effects were nice. Some of the CG was pretty good too!\n\nPart of the reason why this short story is hard to adapt is that the color is literally something humans literally can\u2019t comprehend.

I also thought they did a really good job with adapting it to modern day.\n\nSome problems I had:\n\nWoah this unusual creature literally attacked my arm in the shower... eh a plumber can fix it.\n\nWow my family just turned into a horrible creature and looks to be in pain... let\u2019s not attempt to use the car and rush to the hospital (this was before they knew the car didn\u2019t work).\n\nThe light is burning her! Let\u2019s take her up in the attic where the light shines directly on them.\n\nThey practically ignored the youngest kid the whole movie. He might as well of not existed.\n\nThe daughter cutting herself up got hardly any response from anyone. I get things are crazy but they totally just ignored that. The brother at least should of been concerned.\n\nThe older sons first reaction to hearing his dog despite knowing what\u2019s going on is to literally go down a well. He seemed to have all of his mental faculties so it seemed really random.\n\nI get that people want Cage to go all out in his acting, but his character came off as extremely bi-polar to the point where I didn\u2019t know if it was a joke or not. His mood swings seemed to be even before the color really even started to affect people.\n\nThis one is just a joke observation but did anyone find it weird how the door opened and hit the table in the hall way? Who the hell would have a table there? \n\nThe dialogue was just plain weird and unnatural and not in an unsettling way. Nic talking about the alpacas and explaining how expensive they are actually made me laugh. The daughters acting was really really not good.\n\nTo end on a positive note though: The FX at the end with the blurry vision was just awesome and the vision of the other planet captured Lovecraft incredibly well. It\u2019s such a shame that the movie was so bogged down with sloppy dialogue, odd character choices (including those that weren\u2019t affected by the color) and bad acting.\n\nI do think this director could pull off an honest to goodness great adaptation of The Dunwitch Horror, but he would have to do a better job with casting and have a better script supervisor.", "I liked it. Although, I almost turned it off with the mom/son morph. That poor little boy. I have little children of my own so that really got to me. And the family only really concentrated on talking and comforting the mom. Wtf Also, was the mom/son raping Lavinia?", "Really cool, really pretty. Hard not to compare it to Annihilation. Alot of the same beats but just different enough. Funnily I dont think it was long enough I wanted to learn more about the family and see what manifested for the brother.", "Honestly the main thing I got from this movie was how much I want to see a fantasy movie with similar special effects as the color tornado out of the well at the climax of the movie, only instead it's otherworldly wizards throwing cataclysmic, fantastic spells at each other in a duel. None of the weak ass, ordinary magic in most \"grounded\" stories.\n\nSpeaking of the movie though, it really picks up and starts to shine for me around the halfway mark. A lot of people are saying that they wished that the descent into madness was more subtle, slower, like a unsettling, creepy feeling, which maybe would have worked, idk, but I honestly thought that it was starting to drag from like after the first 1/3 until the barn scene, so I'm glad the situation imploded as fast as it did. \n\nIn addition, there are some complaints about the lack of usage of the time distortion property of the color and I agree to an extent, but I also thought it was a clever way in the middle of the movie of being able to quickly shift from day to night while the individual characters only did 1 or 2 things during those hours, when logically thinking, they would be much more active in figuring out and responding to the situation. To me, the time distortion was more of a plot device that allowed the filmmakers to shift it from day to night in order to setup a scene, so I understand why that aspect wasn't explored as much. If they maybe added a scene where a character feverishly sees an hallucination of an earlier scene, then I think that would have been just enough to completely sell it for me.\n\nNicolas Cage was great, even if he was a bit hammy at times. I didn't think the supporting actors and actresses were that bad either. Not great, but fine. Felt kind of like a blend of the setting of Annihilation with the descent to madness of the Lighthouse, just not as well done in either aspect as those movies. That's more those movies just being top class though. Overall this movie was really enjoyable, and as far as cosmic horror sci-fi movies go, good shit.", "What happened to Benny Gardner?  He just kinda left the movie.  I get that he was stuck in the well and the color touched him, but the movie didnt show what happened to him.   Last time we saw the color touch someone, it turned them into a horrible mutant.  So what happened to him?\n\nAnd why the heck did the movie specifically show him putting on his grandfathers goggles right before the color touched him?  What was that all about?  I expected him to show up at the very end and say, \"Yea, the goggles saved me because they obscured my vision of the color.\"\n\nI felt like this movie had a whole bunch of setup, and the payoff was in a different movie.  Like what was up with Lavinia?  Why did she have a complete breakdown when her mom commented on her clothes?  And the dont throw up part?  Was she struggling with bulimia?", "I thought most of the movie was bad (the writing and dialogue is just cringe and the acting, especially from the kids, is godawful) but I still had a lot of fun watching it. There's some genuinely horrifying shit in here (the alpacas and the mother-son mutation is gonna keep me awake for days) and stuff like Nic Cage going into a Trump impression every time he becomes crazy was hilarious. A proper B-movie guilty pleasure. 6/10", "Cage used the peter loew voice. 10/10", "I think the movie was largely enjoyable. The CGI was actually really good for the budget (except for that stupid cat), the story was fairly faithful despite the modern-day setting, and the slow burn tension that plays out was nice to see. I'm not an avid subscriber to the Crazy Cage acting that Cage brings to the movie and think it brings the film down contrary to what many think, but I understand some enjoy and seek his similar performances. I appreciated that some attention was given to the characters so we can try to care for their demise, like the dinner that they have together before the meteorite hits, but by the end of it, I don't think I actually cared all that much except for Richardson and Arthur's characters and even then it's mainly because they did a pretty good job acting. Chong was a treat, but his character served no purpose (though the scene where they discover his skeleton body with the tape recording playing was a pretty cool movie scene). \n\nI appreciated the practical effects with the Alpaca monster straight out of The Thing, the animal conglomeration corpse, and the mother-son morph. I personally wish the Color itself was more of a cloud or mist than full on tentacle monstrosity with POV scenes.\n\nAlso, that Simon Necronomicon! Didn't expect it but am also not surprised they used it. Also also, ouch! Lavinia is going to have such a big infection!", "Im tickled to see all the Lovecraft references, for example the weather report from Innsmouth and Dunwich and i would bet dollars to donuts that the black and white picture of Nick's father was none other than HP Lovecraft himself.", "Just saw this. WTF? Nic Cage was in true form here. I'll just assume it was a comedy. From that perspective, I think I liked it.", "I'm very confused by this thread. I thought the film was kinda terrible. What's up with the weird dialogue?\n\nAlso, I know people like seeing Nicolas Cage hamming it up but come on, you can enjoy the performance in isolation but still say that it ruined the whole atmosphere of the movie. I couldn't take it seriously anymore.\n\nAlso, the practical effects? They looked so cartoonish to me. I know it sounds like I'm shitting on everything I can but these are my honest opinions.\n\nLastly, what was up with the awkward romantic tension between what I'm assuming is a teenage girl and a guy who looks to be in his late 20s? And the mom is encouraging it?", "This movie got to me in a very real way. Jack looks strikingly like my kid. When that  scene happened, I made it as far as I could. It was when he started screaming with his mom in the attic. I had to fast forward, pause, and calm down. I knew there was a scene like this as I read it described beforehand, but lord of all was I not ready.\n\n\nI haven't been this scared of a movie in my whole life.\n\n\nFucking masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. And I've only watched until the alpacas (I noticed the overall tone is weird, but I think that's kinda the point, what with the insanity and all).\n\nEdit: oh no the mom/son relationship got worse. This fucking movie is nuts.", "Shit was fucked. Good times!", "The trouble with modern Lovecraft adaptations is that other, even unrelated, works have already been inspired by the horror master's writings. And so, even if this were the first adaptation of The Colour Out of Space, it would still in many ways be reminiscent of 2018's Annihilation and a couple of other films. Much of the 'weird stuff' in Color has already been done elsewhere and often to greater effect, leaving this movie feeling derivative rather than novel or awe-inspiring. That, coupled with hammy dialogues and sub-par acting, makes this little more than a B-movie with production values. Nicolas Cage is doing his usual wacky, twitchy, crazy thing which has now transcended laughable and morphed into strangely popular and sought out by a specific audience, creating a new career for Cage as the star of colorful niche genre films like Mandy. There are some cool visuals and practical effects but the writing betrays any film making effort and not even Colin Stetson could make it atmospheric.", "So, I haven't seen this, but I've pictured a scenario that I want to share that I think matches what I've read.\n\n*Nicholas Cage arrives at the initial shoot a \"perfect\" 9 minutes late. He is handed a medium length document which he stops to flip through. After several seconds, he flings this document aside and charges toward the set, yelling \"RELEASE THE BEAST\" just as he moves out of view. Movie magic is made.*\n\nDisclaimer: A. I like Nicholas Cage and B. I'll never watch this movie because I'm too familiar with Lovecraft's version, and also I become vicious and desperate when confronted with new things.", "Damn, Nick Cage is a beast. He is literally in four movies a year, every year,  going back like easily ten years. When does this guy sleep?\n\nSure, they're not all gems, but he gets a pass to this day for \"Adaptation\" and a few others. That one with the code breakers.", "It\u2019s a polarizing movie just like Mandy. You\u2019ll see one super positive comment, one super negative comment, one says \u201cit\u2019s nothing compared to the masterpiece Mandy\u201d next one says \u201cMandy is hot dog shit\u201d\n\nBasically every review everyone has means precisely dick and you have to just go and form your own opinion", "So just to be clear...the mom-son monster was raping the daughter with an alien llama penis, correct? Did I actually fucking witness that? Great movie", "What a wild ride, I quite enjoyed this.", "I fucking loved this movie. I don't think I've ever seen a film toe the line between \"so bad it's good\" and genuinely brilliant before, but that's what Stanley has managed to do with Color Out Of Space and I salute him for it.", "This movie had some of the best practical effects I've seen since The Thing. The amount of time the camera lingered on the mom/son combo truly make my stomach churn, and being a horror buff, it's not often a visual actually makes me feel gross. Take that for what it's worth. \n\nI also really liked how the campy aspects such as Cage losing his shit tapped into the fear. Often, when I'm truly unnerved, I'll find myself laughing because it's like my body physiologically doesn't know how to react. This movie captured that feeling really well, especially towards the end when things are truly bugfuck insane. \n\nReally cool use of lighting, a lot of cool shots and camera work, the Colin Stetson score was amazing. Some of the dialogue and performances were a little cringe and things felt a bit stagnant before the mom cut her thumb off. I wish it had been a period piece rather then adapted to the modern day, but it still captured that Lovecraftian vibe, especially with the narrator/sole survivor.\n\nOverall, a really solid B-movie. Can't wait to see Stanley's other Lovecraft adaptations! This is one of the closest I've seen to nailing the peculiar mixture of absurd, camp, and cosmic dread that permeates his stories.", "Nick Cage yelling \u201cSlam Dunk!\u201d while throwing produce into a trash can is my anthem.", "I literally gasped at the mother child and I watched this in my own home with the lights on", "A lot of people on this thread don't know HP Lovecraft. I can understand watching this and wondering what the fuck.", "I really wanted to like this movie. I had been looking forward to it ever since I saw the first poster for it. I love Lovecraft stories, I like Nic Cage, I like weird trippy stuff.. but this just didn't do it for me. There's a lot to love in this movie but overall I didn't enjoy it.", "Managed to catch this during a limited run last month and loved it.\n\nGreat work on a relatively low budget. Strong acting, good effects, engaging and an actual, successful H P Lovecraft adaptation.\n\nJanuary was definitely a Lovecraftian month at the movies with both this and Underwater playing.\n\nRoll on Stanley\u2019s adaptation of The Dunwich Horror", "Pretty fun movie. Liked how things got worse and worse and crazier as the film went along and Nic Cage stealing the show. The grotesque body horror stuff and the weirdness of what is going on kept me hooked and shows why I love Horror movies in the first place. Nice visuals as well. 7/10", "some parts got a bit too 'the thing' for lovecraft imo.\n\nI still enjoyed it thought, the first half and the ending was great. it did falter a bit around the 2/3 mark though", "I bought the movie. Wasn\u2019t that bad and i\u2019m glad I watched it. Would like to see the person who did Mandy reuse Nicolas Cage for something like this. It needed more creatures. It\u2019s one thing for Nicolas Cage to be over the top, but making the whole family the same was a dumb decision. Wish we had seen the Cage\u2019s rash have some big reveal as to what it was doing to him. Didn\u2019t feel like Ward added anything to the movie and it pulled away from the family way too often to add nothing to the story. Was I the only one who though his interest in Liv was creepy? He\u2019s wearing a university shirt and she\u2019s acting/looking like a 14 year old. He was way too okay with everything considering he was the only one with his bearings. Also, why was Ward not attacked by the light? is water contact necessary? The director should have focused more on ending the movie better than inserting some cliche internal dialogue. Still don\u2019t understand what the hell happened at the end. Really wish the hopelessness of Lovecraft had been conveyed better. Not sure Stanley was the right guy for this movie.", "Watched this for the first time last night! I loved everything about it! The music, the visuals, atmosphere and Cage over acting - all brilliant. Can't believe it's sitting at 6.2 on IMDB.", "Loved it. And yes definitely Annihilation vibes.", "Diehard Lovecraft fan, have an entire sleeve tattoo dedicated to the man.\n\nDiehard Nic Cage fan, I have *never* seen a film he\u2019s been in and not enjoyed it.\n\nBut I live in the countryside and can\u2019t get to one of the 3 cinemas in England playing this. I\u2019m champing at the bit!", " I just watched \"The Color Out of Space\" and... I'm positively surprised! Certainly rough around the edges, but an enjoyable Lovecraftian experience overall. I have seen most of the Lovecraft-inspired movies that are out there, but TCOoS was among the best (admittedly the competition isn't very strong, though). As such I am looking very much forward to new entries in Stanley's series <3", "I saw this movie while incredibly high, and jesus, it was something.\n\nLot of the set pieces / props were fantastic. You really FELT like something was off. I also loved how when you thought this movie should have reached its peak, nope, only 60% of the way there. It just. kept. escalating.\n\nWeird part: I actually think Cage was the weakest part of this film. It felt like he was given a different script / direction from everyone else.", "So, time moved faster closer to the meteorite landing zone. Seeing as Ward was wearing the same Miskatonic University shirt the whole time, was it just one day for him not being on the farm and thus farther from the time warping?", "I watched it yesterday at 4 am. I'm a big fan of Hardware. Stanley is really, really good at framing shots and timing cuts in a way that's deliberately somewhat hypnotic. It's so strange how, remember all the throwbacks as of late to the '80s style' during Stanley's early career? He does the best of that so gracefully here, it feels it could belong to eras at once. And then the Lovecraft on top of that, this is my favorite horror film in a while. The opening and the brutality, and of course Nic Cage, make me VERY excited for future Stanley projects. He's on Cronenberg's level in terms of his visual storytelling, imo.\n\nWeird Stanley-adjacent side story-- When I was in college on VA, a couple of alleged filmmakers who were trying to get a movie about Richard Stanley contacted me from LA (?!) out of the blue because they said I (at the time) bore an uncanny resemblance to him (I did-- in pictures I'd posted to Yahoo, which was sketchy). They said they wanted to make a documentary about his Island of Doctor Moreau debacle but with freeze frame reenactments in some places. They talked to me twice and it never happened, of course, but any Richard Stanley to me now has added strange, so my 4am Color of Scace viewing was colorful in that way too.", "More \"Cronenbergian\" than \"Lovecraftian\". Terrible dialog. Pretty bad acting across the board.\n\nThe color was well done though. Tommy Chong is under-rated and steals every scene he's in (all three of them).", "I'm so glad that I didn't end up getting to see this in theatres like I wanted to, that would've pissed me off. This movie is terrible. Nothing gets shown like every stupid monster movie of the 2000s, just glimpses of creatures and reactions from the dumb actors. Reading the comments in here about how folks just don't \"get\" Lovecraft, y'all can fuck off. Re-animator and its sequels did a much better job of conveying Lovecraft's mind bending stories with clear and concise beginning, middle and end. This Nic Cage movie is just all over the place, no explanation for anything just stupid fancy camera work and shitty extended scenes where nothing happens, just watching the idiotic actors freak out for no reason cause they won't show the monsters. Fuck this movie", "My comment on the older thread:\n\nI wanted to love this film.

Very disappointed. Some YouTube reviewers have said that it\u2019s worth driving hours to a cinema that\u2019ll play it. If you can see it nearby and love Lovecraft enough to see a bad adaptation, do it. Otherwise, stay home and watch Annihilation, it is superior on literally every level.", "[deleted]", "What starts out as an intriguing setup followed by sordid curiosities, Color Out of Space is a monster movie that ends up relying far too much on its visual impact and not enough on anything else in order to compel viewers to feel entertained.", "The mom and son tried to fuse like Goku and Vegeta.", "I came into this as an hp lovecraft fan and not a cage fan. It helps if you like cage. I'm not really a fan personally of cage. His acting in this movie is a good reason why. None of the acting is particularly good. The characters are not developed or interesting and rely on tropes. \n\nAnyway, I really love the subtlety of the original short story. It's that subtlety which makes it spooky. This movie eviscerates the original subtlety and replaces it with Nicholas Cage being Nicholas Cage and more overtly spooky things.\n\nAll in all, a fun movie to watch and not take seriously. Not a special movie by any stretch. It's poorly written, poorly acted, just fun if you turn off your brain. \n\nf you are hoping for Lovecraft levels of artistic merit, you might be upset.

It was both somehow really slow and really ridiculous at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I love a slowburn horror movie with great atmosphere and a solid payoff. I also love movies that are ridiculous from start to finish, and don't ask you to bring your own world to the film. But somehow this movie wanted to have it both ways: to be a realistic, emotional slow-burn, and *also* have you ignore all of the insane and impossible character choices.\n\nThe little doll sets felt completely ripped off of Hereditary, the behavior of both the father and the kids were absolutely ridiculous, the ending was obvious and over the top (without feeling like an earned payoff), and in the end, it had this really weird moralizing tone that made zero sense.\n\nHas anybody watched Arrested Development? That whole bit with the \"and that's why you leave a note!\" It felt like the last frame of the movie was going to be an Arrested Development character popping out to say \"and that's why you don't leave your children alone in the wilderness with somebody mentally unstable and a history of trauma\" AND EQUALLY, a message for the children \"and that's why you don't try to push a person who is already mentally ill over the edge into insanity when you are alone in the middle of nowhere with them.\"\n\nSpeaking of mental illness, the exploration of mental illness in this movie seemed really shallow, unrealistic, and prejudiced. Whenever somebody says \"see this person is 'crazy'\" and gives them unlabeled \"magic pills\" that keep them from having *every single symptom of every single mental illness*, my bullshit meter instantly flies through the rough. Trauma victims aren't walking, hallucinating time bombs just waiting to run out of pills and murder everybody around them. Mentally ill people are almost always only a danger to themselves. That characterization of Grace just felt really hollow and tone-deaf to me.\n\nI have an almost identical criticism of Grace's unexplored past with the cult. It just felt so generically \"culty\" without being developed or interesting. Why was her cult obsessed with sin? Why did the father fall for a cult victim who was obsessed with sin? Wasn't she probably a child when he started his book? Was the father supposed to be a sympathetic character, or do we think that he probably abused Grace too?\n\nI don't know, there were some things I liked about it too: the dog (both how she used it as a crutch and how much it crushed her when she found it), the fact that Grace laughs so inappropriately during sex (people who start having sex at the wrong age can develop an unusual relationship to the emotions involved) and the cinematography was gorgeous, stark, and added a layer of surreality perfectly. But overall, I just thought it was really slow without a worthy payoff, really shallow in its exploration of really deep and important issues, and really ridiculous, over-the-top, and cliched.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and the fucking truck that wouldn't start at the end!

I loved the shots, the colors, the music but man they fucked up on those kids", "As adults it\u2019s already hard enough to identify with kids. Toss in some weird obsession with their soon-to-be stepmom and turn that up to 11 and I just feel bad for Grace. I\u2019m an optimistic person but the conclusion was hopeless without the sense of it being an earned dark ending.", "Everyone in this thread keeps describing what the children did as a prank and I don't understand why. They severally emotionally abused and tortured a women after stealing her psychiatric medications, what a story mark!", "I kinda wish they just stuck with what I thought it was going to be. An occult type horror movie where they (members of the occult) are still trying to get Grace to realize her \"potential\". Especially after the beginning where the father or someone talks about the main character and how important she was to the cult. Wasn't she suppose to continue his work or something?\n\nEdit: Also, I  haven't seen anyone mention this particular thing, what kind of dad  leaves their kids with their girlfriend for some odd days in an isolated  cabin. Then a freak blizzard hits and not once does the dad ask the  little girl to speak with Grace. We know the little girl had been  communicating with the dad over those days, and since Grace's phone was  dead she  obviously wasn't talking to the father to give him updates or how things are going.\n\nAbrupt  weather conditions can change an easy situation into chaos in so many  ways. So why wouldn't the father ask a simple thing as \"Can you put  Grace on the phone honey so that I can see from the ONLY adult there how things are going?\" So many things from these characters that make no sense at all.", "I fucking hate kids man", "The kids were incredibly stupid. You'd think they would have gotten a clue to knock it off when Grace was standing in the room holding a gun and was in a total trance, but then they kept pushing it after that. Unbelievably stupid. I honestly feel like Grace is the victim in this story.", "I knew exactly where \"that scene\" was going the moment the mother started fixing her magazines on the table. Like, I could have snapped my finger at exactly the moment it was going to happen. Still shocked me to the point I was sobbing a bit in the theater. Holy shit.", "Anyone else think that Riley Keough looks so much like a young Alicia Silverstone? When you look at it that way, it makes the dad almost seem even shittier.", "The moment the movie ended I was disappointed, but something drew me back. Something was off to me about the twist. It\u2019s all a prank, etc.\n\nThere are hints that a supernatural force is operating just outside of view. When Grace arrives at the lodge, the door to the first room she enters and then exits swings open after she shuts it, and the darkness behind it is so deep that it seems something is there. \n\nWhen the daughter and Grace are watching home videos of the mother, the screen flickers. Twice the dog barks at the stairs and we hear a creaking and glimpse something, but what? While they\u2019re watching The Thing, the painting jumps on the floor. When the doll goes into the fishing hole, it draws Grace in with it, as if trying to lure her to death. It\u2019s wearing a red hat, the same as the mother\u2019s. \n\nMy theory is pretty simple. When the mother committed suicide, she was indeed stuck in a kind of limbo \u2014 the dollhouse version of the lodge. Which the camera pans to immediately after her suicide. She\u2019s \u201clodged\u201d in the dollhouse, specifically as the doll, and with her lingering  presence begins to take control of her kids. We get a symbolic hint of this during the funeral, when the doll won\u2019t go up with the balloons which swirl around a cross. The doll won\u2019t ascend to the heavens. It remains chained to the daughter here on earth, in purgatory if you will, becoming her surrogate mother. \n\nWe also get a hint of the mother\u2019s presence when the daughter is inconsolable and says she /knows/ her mom hasn\u2019t gone to heaven. Her insistence on this point could be religious, but it could also be that she\u2019s begun vaguely to communicate with her mother, or senses her and her evil. \n\nRemember the doll is pivotal. The fact that it\u2019s missing convinces Grace the kids aren\u2019t lying. It sets the whole scheme into motion. \n\nThe kids themselves seem almost possessed. They\u2019re completely sadistic, and they have no obvious endgame. One way or another the father will find out. And they seem genuinely concerned not to let her die. But they\u2019re not entirely in control of their own actions. The mother is orchestrating things. The lodge is her purgatory, and she\u2019s using the kids to convince her younger replacement, Grace, that she\u2019s in purgatory too, so that it all ends in a bloodbath. The father is killed out of revenge, and the children and the Other Woman must die as well, because if the mother can\u2019t have her family together, no one can. \n\nThe ultimate source of the evil that runs through the mother and into the kids and then into Grace is the father, a true empty vessel, whose manipulation and mistreatment of a particular type of woman \u2014 vulnerable, mentally disturbed \u2014 marks him as pathological. The fact that Grace resembles a younger version of the mother in an almost uncanny way drives that point home. The father is affectless, chilling, and probably narcissistic, a predator, explaining his truly criminal irresponsibility in leaving them in the middle of a snowbound wasteland with no car for days.\n\nFinally, we get a sense that the mother\u2019s presence is joined at the lodge by Grace\u2019s cult leader father, who notably also committed suicide. He seems to be in the window of the eerie and never explained cross-shaped building, and in one of Grace\u2019s dreams he tries to drag her down into the icy lake depths, after another figure below the ice, seemingly not the father (the kids\u2019 mother?), breaks it.", "I\u2019m confused. What were the kids\u2019 endgame with their elaborate ruse?", "I cannot imagine a situation where a father would think it\u2019s wise to leave your fianc\u00e9 with your children isolated that hate her after what these kids have been through.  Even if this had gone another way, they were not going to be nice to her.  I also cannot imagine a woman dumb enough to think this was a great way to be introduced to this man\u2019s kid especially the way they got together and after what happened to their mother.  The dad is the film\u2019s wildcard, he has got to be the most insensitive person on the planet.  \n\nSo I was team kids any person whose parents have been through a divorce can relate.  You feel an unimaginable rage to the parent that left, their new love interest and the situation.  Also it\u2019s so annoying when your parent are like I love so and so...so you will too.", "I truly didn't enjoy this movie, and I wanted to. The actors and atmosphere are great. But it felt dark and hopeless for the sake of being dark and hopeless. A lot of good shocks, but no bigger question or theme running through it. One of those movies that people will take very seriously just because everyone in it is very serious.", "Holy shit they started gaslighting her literally after lighting the gas heater \n\nAlso can we talk about how gorgeous the film looked? Every shot was beautiful, the color schemes were fantastic, and (especially in the first half) there was a ton of symmetry", "Still waiting for someone to explain the boy having enough balls to pull that entire prank off, but do nothing to the sleepwalking zombie lady who at one point completely leaves the gun on the table. \n\nUntil then, everyone should rate this movie poorly.\n\n/rant. I'm sorry but this movie REALLY pissed me off. I've been waiting for a leak since quarantine started because of how badly my wife and I have wanted to see this.", "PSA: this was added to Hulu today for anybody still waiting to watch", "The kids are the evil in this movie. That was an elaborate, thought out and sick prank. I actually was rooting for her to kill them. If that was the point then success", "[removed]", "two people walked out of my showing (during the scene when she's burning her legs) but I enjoyed it!", "In terms of the so called \"elevated/arthouse horror\" movement, It's a mixed bag. \n\nEverything ingredient is in here for a far greater film than we get. The technical attributes are outstanding, the chilly, claustrophobic, cinematography, the creepy original score, fantastic set design (loved how some of the interiors had a miniature look just like the dollhouse shots, even if Hereditary already did it better). The performances are top notch, Keough once again turns in a fascinating performance, the child actors-- especially the daughter-- are great, and Alicia Silverstone is haunting even with her limited screen time and not just because of the outcome of her character. She does a lot with not much, and I would have liked to follow her a little more. \n\nThere are so many intriguing elements to the story, from the heaven's gate-esque suicide cult, to mental illness, religion, to possible purgatory, as well as mental illness, trauma, gas lighting, etc. But it takes the most predictable route and doesn't really do anything fresh or exciting with it. \n\nThe first 45 minutes or so are filled with dread and tension, and I really couldn't predict where it might go, but then it becomes pretty obvious what is happening, and becomes really absurd. Plus all the \"it's really a nightmare!\" sequences kind of deflate the suspense since every time the film becomes strange, you know someones about to just wake up. \n\nSimilar to how I felt to Goodnight Mommy, it's high style over weak/thin substance, with a great build up, and an unremarkable payoff. I still think these filmmakers have a great film in them, but it's mostly just occasionally effective misery porn that doesn't go deep enough. \n\nA waste of a lot of potential. And quite a big disappointment since I had been anticipating this film for over a year. Normally I'd recommend seeing a film like this in theaters, despite not liking it myself, but you really aren't missing out on much if you wait for digital download.", "I wish people would stop trying to compare the houses used in this and Hereditary. Both are clearly used for different reasons. The houses in Hereditary are more about control and the houses in The Lodge are more about how the kids intend to prank Grace. Great fucking film! It's like Hereditary's cousin but just as evil and sinister. That final scene will haunt me for a while!", "it makes zero sense these two little bastards could think up such elaborate pranks and schemes but could do shit to stop the nearly comatose sleepwalking woman. I mean yeah she\u2019s got a piece on her but they could have snatched it from her at the dinner table or pushed her ass down the steps or something.

It's so deliciously fucked up I love it.", "This movie reminded me so much of Ari Aster. Stylistically, narratively (exploring the mental breakdowns of broken women involved in cults), and just the sheer brutality and cruel, uncomfortably realistic personal situations he puts his characters through. And having an extremely strong female lead performance, for that matter.   \n\n\nDidn't think this movie was quite as effective as his stuff (it was a bit more muddled and manipulative on a story level, imo) but I couldn't shake the similarities.", "Did not like this. I think this had the \"creepy\" flaw. They just kept adding and showing things in order to be creepy and put shots in the trailer, only for them to be visions. Kids cannot be that stupid. By the time they see that she sleepwalks AND she has a gun with her I'd be like \"oh fuck no\". Not only that, they just let her leave out in the cold pretty much knowing she could die over there. I get that they want to teach her a lesson, but being responsible for HER DEATH? Another time kids would have been like \"oh hell nah\"\n\nBy the time she's gone full on crazy you're light \"yeah just go ahead and kill them\" and you're left with no one to root for.", "I didn\u2019t like all of it, but I give it props for originality, and for telling a genuinely dark and twisted story.", "The time to come clean was when she was leaving alone. The only reason they did eventually come clean was the fear of her freezing to death. It was just as likely if not more that she would freeze when she was leaving alone.

REAL quick.", "I don\u2019t understand what the kids plan was in the long term.", "So are we supposed to believe these young kids supposedly photoshopped a professional looking obituary page for Grace and them?

How the hell can you leave your kids with a stranger? Yes idc if you've been fucking for the past year she is still a stranger to those kids. To make matters worse you leave your children in a house 6 hrs away with a stranger who you entrusted with a gun??? If you fear for their safety so much then fucking stay with them! You have this big fucking modern house, a mountain lodge, and you tell me you still have to work Christmas week??? Kinda of a fucking job does he have? Maintenance???

Stuck in a remote mountain cabin, the trio are terrorized by a supernatural force.\"  LOL", "So at the very end it seems to imply that there are just two bullets left, right? She would kill the kids and then be left alone in the house to slowly die of starvation and craziness.

And then he just constantly ignores and accepts their utter contempt for her as if it\u2019s just a phase that\u2019ll fade after they hang out together for a few days. I guess there must be some people who just suck this much at being parents and completely don\u2019t understand how to connect with other human beings such as their own children, but it\u2019s pretty nonsensical to me and just weakens the story since it becomes clear that the character only serves as a ridiculous plot device", "I truly hated this movie.

I think Goodnight Mommy was better in terms of scares and just overall story. It also had a good plot twist. But The Lodge offered some good visuals and still a neato story.

What was that about/the ~meaning~? I might be misremembering the location (it might have been the mom's home), but I just remember seeing that and wondering what the point of it was...", "Putting aside the outlandishness of their scheme in general, my biggest gripe with the film (and I can almost *always* set these kinds of things aside to enjoy a movie) is how many times a character could have SO EASILY disarmed the woman once she had clearly been driven insane. This applies to both the kids AND the dad. And they never even attempted. Just sit there helpless while you're in a situation where you could easily tackle this person, grab the gun from behind while she's preparing to shoot your dad, flip the table while the gun is just sitting on it. Nah. Let's just sit here, try nothing, and let her kill us all.", "I'm really split on this movie. I thought for the most part it was mostly unsettling but slow burn watch. While there were boring parts, that also came with the feeling of isolation for the characters and the viewer. The organ playing, me brushing off the kids as the culprits  because why would they take it that far, \"that scene\" with the kids birth mom, and the ending was some heavy hitting moments.\n\nHowever, really dumb character decisions. Letting the kids be behind Grace as their walking down the stairs with the gun in Grace's hand(just shove her). People saying that the dad just should have charged aren't think that through. Put yourself in that scenario, would you really do that? Even in a struggle, she could have shot him.\n\nAiden hanging by the neck. I also didn't feel like the film let us connect with Grace at all.

Kids and teens don\u2019t think about the consequences of their actions especially when they\u2019re  upset that their mom just died and they blame it on grace. They\u2019re not going to be thinking how grace can go crazy if she\u2019s off her meds, as kids they probably don\u2019t even know what happens if someone stops taking their meds.

Atmosphere, setting and cinematography are all superb; likewise the excellent soundtrack and sound design, which blends everything incredibly well: sound, music, steps, voices echoes, whispers.\n\nRiley Keough is great as the tentative, dazed ex-cult member but all actors do a good job. The plot relies on the characters, particularly the father and the two kids, making decisions which seem questionable, but not totally unbelievable. There is at first  vestiges of of anti-Christian bias but ultimately it's more about fanaticism and a deviation of Christian redemptive ideals. \n\nIt's a movie whose greatest virtue is in the way it feels: the snowbound visuals are amazing, and many of the filming angles are almost painterly.

Make Grace look crazy so their dad would leave her? \n\nI was expecting that it would be revealed they did something similar to their mom, and caused her suicide themselves.

How could kids do something like that?\"\n\nTheir Mum just killed herself, they blame this woman, and the Dad has forced them to stay together.

The revolver empty slot argument also is viable. I'm not thinking too deep in it, but that's how I interpreted it initially and it added to my feelings at the end.

After that, everything fell flat for me. I thought they nailed the cinematography and the shock factor of when the house was suddenly empty. \n\nI wish it was something larger than just a prank gone wrong. I get the motives, but it was too convenient and the supernatural/seemingly sci-fi concept would\u2019ve made a hell of a lot more interesting plotline, especially if they maintained the weirdness and mystery till the end, like The Lighthouse.", "I rather liked the movie. A lot of the comments here are pointing out how a lot of things quite literally was far-fetched, but let's take a step back here.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, everyone is an unreliable narrator. Our first protagonist, the wife, had just killed herself. She's clearly not mentally stable, and she had seen Grace walk out. Who knows if she was also hallucinating. Do we trust her, or her soon to be ex-husband who claims Grace isn't there?\n\nOur new narrator is Grace, who from the beginning seems unreliable and untrustworthy. I mean, she's introduced as supposedly killing her entire cult. Here's where I'm okay with some things being far-fetched because it's not meant to be taken literally. We go down a rabbit hole of her own psyche.\n\nPerhaps part of the reason why I resonated so strongly with this movie is that I did date someone with two kids (no longer married, at least). When you step into the crazy responsibility that is motherhood, it's even crazier when there is a gaping hole of the woman before. One of the biggest reasons why we aren't still together is because of his kids, which this movie hit a little too close to home.\n\nAnd the movie does explore the dark side of what \"motherhood\" means. The universal fear of being hated by the people you so desperately want to love, the brutal (and unhealthy) way of coping with impossible trauma by faking it with a smile when you're crying, and by numbing yourself with medication. By the endless gnawing doubt that you're the second one, you're the replacement, you're worse than a replacement, you're a slut... maybe the world would be better off if you disappeared.\n\nTo me, the core of what this film is the imposter syndrome of motherhood. There's 3 main mothers in this film. The first mother, who supposedly looked so happy (in the video recording) and dolled-up with makeup, who's refusing to deal with the reality of her failed marriage, and by extension her failure as a mother. The second mother, Grace, who so miserably fails to provide some semblance of motherhood to these infuriating children. The third, Virgin Mary, the painting that seems to get more screentime than even the kids lol. Not very subtle.  Virgin Mary is the impossible ideal of motherhood: chaste, selfless, honorable, pure. When comparing herself to this impossible ideal, inadequate isn't near enough to describe how Grace is feeling.\n\nI did wonder why this film was called The Lodge, and not something like Hereditary, or something around motherhood. I wondered, why did the directors try so hard to set up the eerie and beautiful shots between the dollhouse and the lodge? I think that it's to emphasize the metaphor of what the dollhouse represents. The farce. **The farce of a loving family, the farce of loving motherhood, the farce of even just being sane.**\n\nOne thing that hit particularly close to home was that I think at one point, Grace did try to stop herself, but she utterly failed. I think that her decision to stay outside the home was largely a selfless one, the last act of her own sanity. When she realized she was sleepwalking with a gun and she hurt Mia, I think that her attempt to leave the house was one to protect the kids from herself. When she went back into the lodge, the sane Grace was completely gone. I think there's some really subtle symbolism here. Her attempt to escape was an attempt to escape from the traumas of her family, both past and present. It was Grace asserting herself to take control of her own life. But try as hard as she could, she couldn't find a haven anywhere else. And the moment she stepped back in, it was the acquiescence to her past family who demanded she and everyone repent.\n\nWhile the strongest part of the movie is Grace's slow psychological descent, the weakest parts are definitely the relationships in the film and Grace as a character. The dad is merely a plot device. The only real emotional connection between the characters seems to be between the siblings. We don't know anything about Grace's side of the story, beyond the eerie shots of her revealing all the dead people. What was her actual involvement? Why was she the one behind the camera recording all the dead people? Why the fuck was she the only survivor (beyond that being an overused plot device)? What was her life like before meeting Richard? Did she ever feel regret or guilt that she was seeing a man whose divorce wasn't finalized? Or was she blameless in that? I also agree with some other comments that revealing that most of the events were indeed pranks was a little bit silly. I would've preferred if it was left ambiguous to everyone's interpretation.\n\n**TL;DR** Gave the movie a break for its ridiculousness sometimes because everyone is an unreliable narrator. Liked the movie because it captured the dark and ugly of being an \"imposter mother.\" Wish Grace's past and character were better explored.", "I've never walked out of a movie and I love an atmospheric, slow burn horror film, but this *really* tested my patience. I watched the whole thing and absolutely hated it.", "I would\u2019ve believed anything before I believed that the kids emotionally traumatized this woman as \u201crevenge\u201d. I was thinking maybe her cult had followed them to the cabin and was trying to bring her back, or maybe the dad was a member of the cult and marries people in order to make them kill themselves. Anything besides \u201ctwo children looted the entire house, made 100 snow angels during a snow storm, and were perfectly okay with their stepmom walking miles in a storm instead of just telling her it was a prank\u201d\n\nI spent the second half of the movie waiting for the next twist that would answer all the questions, but instead it was just \u201cooh she turned crazy and now they sing a song for way too long. Isn\u2019t that scary and deep?\u201d\n\n(I think this movie wanted to be Hereditary)", "I really got the groove of this movie. Pretty good performances from the kids and adults, especially. Loved the foreshadowing (what I could make anyway) and the buildup. Some may the pace was slow but you\u2019re watching snow falling on cedars for the most of the movie. That frosty makeup looked great! It\u2019ll be decisive, but there\u2019s a lot to like here.\n3 outta 5. Definitely bring a onesie and a crucifix.", "To the people who think the dad is the 'bad guy', may I ask why? Because he decided to leave a failing marriage and move on with his life?", "Wow the ending has all the characters except for grace behave in such a stupid manner. Nobody thinks to take the gun from her hand even though they had so many chances to. Finally before he gets shot the dad is holding her hand with the gun in it! Why wouldn't he just point it away. It's like he wanted to die. And fuck! Could he just not try and talk to her instead of just saying don't do this don't do this. When has that ever worked! And the boy also doesn't do a good enough job convincing her that it was all just pretend! Can nobody COMMUNICATE in this movie! We get grace is messed up in the head but are the other characters retarded as fuck!? The ending made me so mad. The entire movie had such a good buildup and I was thoroughly enjoying myself but the payoff was shit. The ending honestly spoilt the entire movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.", "[deleted]", "What's w all the hate? Best flick I've seen in awhile!!", "what really bugged me about this movie was the lack of communication skills the brother/son has. Im sorry but he basically played the same character from IT just without the stuttering. How fucking hard is it to tell your dad \" HI DAD, MY MOM JUST KILLED HERSELF AND YOURE DATING A GIRL WHOS A SOLE SURVIVOR FROM A CULT AND I DONT KNOW IT JUST DOESNT FEEL RIGHT TO BE LOCKED IN WITH HER IN THE MIDDLE OF BUMBLEFUCK MOUNTAIN TOWN.\"\n\nyea they stated at first they don't want to go, but I would never give in even if my dad kept trying to convince me. Fuck that. And then at the end when they're in the attic hiding from the girl they just mentally destroyed and don't do anything. If he could try and convince her that they were dead by fake hanging himself, then he could try a little harder in convincing her that its all a joke. He was like \"Grace, come in, its cold,  it was a jokes seriously\" and then he stopped persuading her. If it was me, even at 13/14, I would explain to her how I made the fake obituary, how I faked hanged myself, how the dog....well that wasn't fake , and then I would show her all the stuff I hid in the basement.\n\nSome people say that she might have, in fact, been in her own purgatory. But I don't think so because they showed the kids going back to her belongings in the basement, without her in the frame.  Before that happened, I was convinced they were all dead. \n\nIm also glad the kids died in the end. Who the fuck pulls a prank like that. Dumb bitches", "Jesus Christ the film took sooo fucking long to get to the point. It really pussy footed around. This film wasnt for an audience as much as it was for the writer. \n\nThe idea was solid, the scares were nonexistent, and the acting was amazing. But the delivery was just a fuckin drag. It felt like every plot point was more for the writer to show off how edgy they are rather than to be an honest portrayal of an event that could possibly happen. It just didn't work for me at all. \n\nA film cannot rely on anxiety of what's going to happen for a full 2 hours without giving us any bit of payoff whatsoever. There should've been a couple terrifying payoffs but no. The entire movie was about building anxiety about what's going to happen...all the way up until the credits roll. No payoff doesn't work for an audience. \n\nThat's why Hereditary is the better film.", "This movie was pretty bad. Felt like some film school student wanted to make their own version of Hereditary without any self-awareness.", "Surprised no one has mentioned the movies nod to Hereditary in the first 5 minutes. After showing us the dollhouse, the first scene with the kids has them waving the dolls head out the car window and the little boy asking if he can make the head pop off.", "While I liked the heck out of it, it felt like something didn't completely work. Took a bit to figure out what, but soon realized the characters never connected with me. Everyone was distant and I never came along fully on their journey. That and it didn't quite have a strong feel the storytelling, like they couldn't quite decide which truth was going to win out until filming.And where it was didn't add up. Kids can go too far without thinking about it, as was the case in Goodnight Mommy as well, but there is something in IT kid didn't call it off when he saw she was breaking too much.\n\nBut on the plus side, I loved the look, tone, and atmosphere. Claustrophic but also scary in the wide-open outside of the cabin. The repeated shots of the hallway to the kid's room looking like a cross was nice, but merely seeing ceilings and walls create confinement. The performances were great.\n\nFurther thoughts:  [https://cityofgeek.com/2020/02/27/the-lodge/](https://cityofgeek.com/2020/02/27/the-lodge/)", "Honestly, the more I think about the movie, the less sense it makes. Yeah, the acting was great, the cinematography was good, the switcheroo towards the end was unexpected... but I feel that the directors couldn't decide on which type of movie they wanted to make.

It almost would have been better if it ended when  the kids were trying to get away in the car. The last scene seemed pointless as it also ended on a note of not actually showing the kids being hurt and the car scene was much more intense than the last dinner scene. I was half expecting the father to wake up at table and suddenly say something like, \"Did that teach you kids a lesson?\" \n\nI'd recommend it despite its flaws.", "This could have been great, but it just...wasn\u2019t good at all. There\u2019s a difference between a good slow burn, and then there\u2019s something like this.", "Haaaated it.  The father literally just lets himself get shot in the head. Fucking awful writing.", "It's a very atmospheric film with some good cinematography and all that jazz, but I found too many things in the plot that required some serious suspension of disbelief:\n\n- Two young kids decide to randomly investigate their step mother's background for no particular reason? Really? There must be a more realistic way for them (and us) to find out about Grace's cult upbringing than an 8yo and a 13yo (or whatever their ages are) deciding *\"hey, you know that lady dad has been dating for probably over a year now, considering they decided six months ago to get married? Let's do extensive background research on her right now!\"* \n\n- The dad leaves his kids alone with his fianc\u00e9, with whom they're clearly not comfortable, for days in a remote location beyond reach of civiliation, during Christmas, not long after the tragic and traumatizing suicide of their mother? And he doesn't rush home when he can't get in touch with her, or get someone to check on the person he put in charge of his children and who depends on medication to stave off psychosis? Father of the year material...\n\n- Are we supposed to interpret that these kids are complete sociopaths? They drug their step mother, hide every object in the house including *their food* in the attic, and deprive her of medication. They then proceed to pull a days-long \"prank\" that drives her to a mental breakdown. The boy even fake-hangs himself. What's the actual reason for any of what goes on in the film? It doesn't make any sense. Why do they do this?\n\n- *How* do they do this? Just the sheer logistics of two kids transferring every object in the house into a crawlspace overnight is absurd. Were they sprinting around for hours, frantically gathering the entire fucking inventory of the house and painstakingly hauling it up the stairs? Did they plan it ahead of time and have the \"in loving memory\" photo framed, as well as a fake fucking newspaper obituary manufactured in preparation for this pants-on-head insane scheme they're pulling?\n\n- And then these two (apparently) incredibly talented, amazingly bold and hyper-intelligent kids proceed to let their now insane stepmom kill their dad and - the movie implies - them as well. They have the resourcefulness and temerity to set up such an unbelievably elaborate plan, but once things actually get dangerous and they're alone with a murderer, they lack the ability to... run away? They just sit there and accept their fates? They're suddenly helpless little children?\n\nIt's just not believable. Too many ridiculous events are required in order for the plot to work. The actual scenes have some pretty good suspense moments, the use of music is well-done and the acting isn't particularly bad, but I constantly sat there wondering why any of this is actually happening. It's so far-fetched and nonsensical.\n\nThe entire premise of the story hinges on the apparent fact that these two kids are utter psychopaths, but the film doesn't actually present them as such. It's like the viewer has to read something between the lines that isn't actually written between the lines. It's just too bizarre. There's no rhyme or reason between the way the characters are portrayed and the things they actually do, and it doesn't feel like any of that is intentional. \n\nIt doesn't give the impression that the writers sat down and went *\"alright, these deeply psychotic kids are gonna go to ridiculous amounts of trouble to drive their stepmom crazy, but they need to seem pretty normal.\"* It's more like *\"so this lady needs to go crazy, what can we come up with that might make that happen?\"* And then they went with the first thing that came to mind without wondering if it made any sense at all, which it really doesn't.", "Im okay with slow movies that eventually pick up the pace.

Buck, notably, doesn't become anywhere as aggressive and violent as he became in the original novel, mostly staying the same sweet, goofy dog the entire story. In fact, the film has to have Harrison Ford *narrate* how wild Buck is becoming, because it's barely happening onscreen. The \"call\" itself, by the way, is actually visualized as a giant black wolf that Buck hallucinates; oddly enough, he sees the wolf a lot during the first half of the film, but then the wolf just disappears until the very end.\n\nAlso, in the film, the sled dogs are much friendlier and gentler, instead of the vicious, half-feral mongrels from the book. In fact, Buck forms a very emotional and loving bond with the mushers and sled dogs in this version...who then proceed to completely drop out of the story as they did in the novel. It's jarring. Even more jarring is setting up an entirely new subplot and character development for John Thornton, and then killing him off anyway like in the novel. What was even the point?\n\nAnd, of course, yes, Buck's CGI is *weird*. Even more baffling, the other CGI dogs, plus the CGI wolves and bear, are actually quite well-done. I suppose it's because the film decided to give Buck a lot of human facial expressions and mannerisms, while the other animals actually look and behave like animals. I was particularly impressed with the adorable white wolf Buck befriends; she looked very real, and showed emotion while still moving and behaving like a wolf.\n\nAll that said, the movie does have some pretty beautiful visuals and great performances, and from time to time it does manage to be funny or heartwarming or even tearjerking.

Cheesy of course because of the premise, but once you get passed that, it\u2019s enjoyable. \n\nThe CGI dog / dogs / animals sort of slipped into uncanny valley in some sequences but as the movie went on I was able to suspend my disbelief. \n\nHarrison Ford was Harrison Ford.

I was smiling from ear to ear the whole movie. Omar Sly was so enthusiastic and engaging. He really sold his performance.

I suppose everyone has their own opinion on it, but I feel like the harsher stuff in the book was important to the general narrative. I didn't really feel Buck becoming 'wild' - he seemed to stay the same dog for the entirety of the movie. \n\nThe Buck vs Spitz fight was well done, but I wish it had been a little bit longer, and of all the things gone from the book I wish this one had been included exactly. They also neglected that Perrault had known it would have happened eventually. \n\nI didn't watch any of the trailers, so I didn't know the tone would have been so child-friendly.

I almost cried.", "Well, we have a new John Powell score so I'm happy", "Great film....really enjoyed it!", "Well, after reading today's box office articles this has \"flop\" written all over it. And it's a shame because once you get past the off-putting CGI -and to be fair to the movie it's only at times that it looks iffy, but it's fine throughout most of the runtime I'd say- it's a really entertaining and sweet movie.\n\nWent to see this with my dad, who almost never goes to the movies but is a fan of the novel, and he really enjoyed it too.\nHarrison Ford plays a fairly standard \"haunted\" character but does a good job. \n\nDefinitely a recommendation in my book.", "I thought it was good, but was disappointed that the dog didn\u2019t talk. \u201cRuff, hey John, don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve had enough? Try one of my Scooby snacks!\u201d", "I want to add my little grain of sand to the discussion by saying that I was surprised by how much I actually liked it.\n\nLike others said, the cgi was very cartoonish in the beginning, but I quickly got it over since lots of the humor comes from bucks facial expressions and interactions. \n\nI absolutely loved the hallucinations buck had of his guide. I wished they had remembered about it for more than half the movie. Harrison was good and the sled team was great. the fight between spritz and buck was almost like a dream with the night setting.", "It\u2019s odd how just about every creature in this film has better cgi than the main character, Buck. They should have used real dogs or they should have dialed back the anthropomorphic aspect especially with Buck. The wolves have great cgi though. I\u2019m wondering the most likely outcomes for the other sled dogs. I thought Spitz might have went off and killed himself, or came back later for revenge but that didn\u2019t happen. Ford\u2019s character was good but we really didn\u2019t need the human villain imo. I thought it was a missed opportunity for the wolves, or at least Buck\u2019s mate, to not come help him kill the villain. Oh well", "So is Buck as massive a mix as he is in the book, weighing 140 pounds (63.5 kilos)?  He looks kind of regular size in the trailer.", "I love how grumpy and badass Francoise is", "Was just tricked into seeing this movie. The dog immediately looked odd to me. The anthropomorphic depiction of the dogs was corny. The immediate relationship everyone gained with the dog was cheesy. Everyone and everything was 1-dimensional. The story wasn\u2019t interesting. What a bad movie.", "The movie feels like a very well made kids' movie. I liked it. Harrison Ford played his role very well. I think modern audiences are too used to large VFX ridden movies these days to pay any attention to such a movie, but I think it's worth watching.", "Still working on my review, but on the whole it was a fine enough family film. The CG on Buck was sometimes good, but often awful- mostly the night scenes. He just didn't fit in with the real-life scenes. If he looked better (and the other dogs), it would have strengthened the film. Putting that aside, the action and characters were solid, it had an effortless charm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFord feels like he gives a shit in an understated performance. Loved Sy and Gee.   Dan Stevens is a wholly different movie and I loved his Snidely Whiplash. Sad he didn't twirl his mustache. Or tie Gillian to the railroad tracks. Speaking of Gillian, I thought it was funny he made sure to mention the rest of the dog team lived, but no mention of the other dandies - are they dead?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still wish Togo was released theatrically and this went right to D+.  By far the better sled dog movie.", "I guess it\u2019s trendy to criticize CGI and to know the term uncanny valley but I thought it was all wonderfully done.

Not to them!\".\n\nPure drama", "Chris Stuckmann mentioned Togo as a better version of this story to come out recently, definitely check that out on Disney+. Top 5 of 2019 that flew way under the radar.", "To be honest, I enjoyed this one. The CGI can be distracting, yes, but for what it was, I thought it was a warm, really well-made adventure drama.", "I liked it. The CG isn\u2019t quite there yet, but I did find myself caring for Buck. Harrison Ford put in a decent performance. And it was great to watch in Dolby Cinema.", "So anyone who's seen this movie knows that James Mangold comes up as producer at the end right?\n\nSo why is he not credited on imdb and when I look it up I can't find anything about his involvement?", "The call of the Wild: Dog of the Yukon from 1997 is still, even with this new version, the best version produced. A real dog, a *believable* monster of a dog (Leonberger) that you absolutely fall in love with. Very faithful to the book. \n\nI highly encourage folks that liked this new one to go back and check out the 1997 version, it's often missed/forgotten.", "I went in with only seeing the trailers and I did not expect it to be as dark as it was at times. With that being said, I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have any expectations for this movie but I'm surprised that I liked it.\n\nThe CGI can be off-putting as a few moments the animation may stutter or the lighting might be off in a few scenes. But it's still capable of bringing emotion and continues to make you immersed in the movie. Maybe in 5 years the CGI won't really age as well, but it helps that all the animals are CGI.\n\nI think during the halfway point it started to drag for me. A lot of people like Harrison Ford's performance in this but I'd disagree.

There were a few REALLY cheesy moments - everything with Dan Stevens especially was over the top (but it mostly worked in my opinion - he plays a villain well).

But on the whole it was a lot better than either of us were expecting.", "Amazing story bogged down by lazy writing and often distractingly bad CGI.\n\nThe scenes with Harrison Ford were consistently great (if you ignore the cheesy and on-the-nose dialogue from the other characters).

Bopping his machine repeatedly until it breaks.\n\nMentioning of an \u201cextra life\u201d.\n\nThe entire chase scene was how one would play the video game.

This is a kids movie through and through, with everything that implies, but it's a good kids movie whether you have any connection to this character or not. It's only ninety minutes long, so I was never waiting for it to be over. Sonic ends up being a very charming character, if a bit motor-mouthed (which is to be expected). Ben Schwarz really nails the voice acting. Jim Carrey is channeling some series Ace Ventura vibes and I was all in for it.\n\nIt's absolutely a fine movie. Kids will love it.

Add in a bar brawl, terrible 90s dialogue, a sister in law obsessed with divorce, a kidnapping, a literal hostage scenario, jokes about kids in cages, and loads of talk about alcohol including a literal Corona ad and this was like watching the Super Bowl.

Bonus- I didn't realize Robotnik's drones were egg-shaped until Sonic pointed it out.

Their chemistry was great. The various references to the games were really good without being obnoxious, Sanic was a very wonderful surprise, and the mid-credits reveal was perfect.\n\nOnly real complaint is that the third act kinda came and went. The bit with the missiles and the building push was in the trailer. The race around the world felt somewhat redundant, and the final showdown felt less exciting than the fight with the babushka robot earlier in the movie. Also, some of the humor misses hugely... Sonic flosses two more times than I would have liked.\n\nOtherwise, I really liked it and I'm surprised by that. I'd still love an Ugly Sonic version.

The movie knew it was cheesy and went with it.", "[deleted]", "This was delightful. Sonic was perfectly characterized and brought to life by Ben Schwartz, who has been building up quite a voice over resume the last few years. Carrey was of course terrific, and there were a few moments towards the end of the film where he seemed to directly channel Mike Pollock's portrayal from the games; not sure if that was intentional or not.\n\nI liked how they kept it a relatively simple set up and kept things moving. There wasn't much in the way of forced or unnecessary drama. Sure, Sonic gets upset with Tom over his decision to leave Green Hills, but that doesn't lead to some forced parting or anything.\n\nThe set up for a sequel / threequel is pretty clear also. We have Tails, Eggman should be able to create Metal Sonic from the quill, and they can go from rings being the plot device to Chaos Emeralds. Knuckles and possibly Amy could tie in as well, but of course they'll want to keep the additions for each film balanced.", "Jim Carrey started to sound like eggman at the end", "[deleted]", "I thought it was a very fun, enjoyable movie.

Nothing really special, but it still was a fun movie. Loved Sonic's portrayal, the human characters were actually likable and of course, Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik.

I think that with all the ideas set up there's room for a potentially better sequel.", "It was good! \n\nMy main motivation for watching the movie was seeing how the filmmakers went back and redid Sonic's character design after outrage from fans.

So the island doesn't weirdly grant twisted fantasies then - so what was the point of the beginning bit where we watch a girl die presumably from a previous batch of prospective fantasy holiday makers?\n\nOR the island DOES grant monkey paw fantasies but in this case it was the girl's fantasy that everyone else has monkey paw fantasies that culminated in their deaths (even though that would have happened anyway) and her fantasy mainly involved a charred corpse occasionally popping up.\n\nHer fantasy was also presumably focused on having to engage in an extended ruse where she treks through a jungle for a long time engaging in small talk and character development with her high school bully and then she calls a rescue plANE BUT THE RESCUE PLANE GETS SHOT DOWN BY MERCENARIES WHO HAVE AN RPG (WHO ARE PART OF SOMEONE ELSES FANTASY GONE WRONG) SO I GUESS THAT WAS PART OF HER PLAN OR NOT?

At no point does anyone say 'hey so you knew the island was going to try and kill us, and you also kidnapped a woman knowing that she would be tortured, what's up with that?'

First of all, Jimmy Yang and Ryan Hansen are both great, but I hated how corny they were in the film, they were the only bit of comedy in this...erm...thriller ? I guess.

My favorite part was in the beginning when Billie and Pete sat with the crazy European lady and her \u201cSO\u201d, and also when they were trying to make a formal complaint to the head of the ski resort where they were at. Them fighting infront of Zach and his GF was also quite funny. But anyways, I thought the humor in this was quite good overall. I also really just enjoyed the story. I thought their character and relationship development was done well and intriguing. I thought it presented some pretty important themes like with living in the moment, being there for your family and etc..

I thought the acting was great, the movie looked good, but the humor didn't hit with me. It was stuck in a weird spot between surreal and realistic, kinda like Ostlund's *The Square*. I don't know, didn't get much from it. Was like a 7/10 for me.\n\nNow, for this remake, it's a huge step down from that. Everything is dumb-downed and over-explained (checks every cliche of a bad American remake of a layered international film). There's 0 nuance in the dialogue, subtle as a brick (far removed from *The Descendants* for Faxon/Rash). I  thought Julia Louis-Dreyfus was actually really bad in this (in the original, the lead actress absolutely carried the movie, in this one not so much. She just basically makes over-exaggerated facial reactions to Will Ferrell for 90 minutes straight. It's pretty distracting. She had one good scene but that climax is so much better in the original (annoying to always compare it, but it is what it is).\n\nThe kid characters were basically just cardboard cutouts in this (whereas in the original they actually had depth and served a huge purpose). They could've easily not been there in this movie. Didn't like the 'overly-sexual, weird, stereotypical Europoean' hotel clerk character they introduced. I guess she serves a purpose in adding gray area and doubt in the lead actresses' mind, but it's so obvious it sucks. Hilarious cameo from Kristofer Hivju.\n\nMost importantly, I *really* missed the [theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ZEmbBru50) from the original. It really filled the space and added a sense of grandeur to the whole thing.\n\n5/10 I guess. Will Ferrell was surprisingly good in this.", "This was NOT good.", "I felt bad as there were obviously a bunch of couples on a Valentine's date night at my screening and I felt like the only one into the movie. It's playing at virtually every movie theater and has been rolled out like a mainstream tentpoll comedy on Valentines day, but its really meant for a few select art-house indie film goers. And even I was mixed on it. \n\nI think the humor relies on the uncomfortable silence of Lewis and Ferrell. The long pauses of silences where Ferrell has this look of a dog who's been shamed by its owners for pooping on the rug, is kind of hilarious. I haven't seen the original 2014 \"Force Majeure\" film, but I liked Downhill. Probably will never see it again but I felt entertained.\n\nI admit I'm a sucker for dysfunctional indie anti-comedy comedies. Wilson, The Comedy, Punch Drunk Love, Jack Goes Boating, etc.\n\nBtw Downhill had two pretty amazing new comedy trailers: Barb and Star Go To Del Vista Mar(the bizarro surrealist new Kristin Wiig comedy) that you can only see in theaters, and \"The LoveBirds\" which has that Date Night/Game Night/Horrible Bosses sort of vibe.\n\nAlso, the whole premise of the movie made no sense...why would a classy high end resort do a controlled avalanche explosion during the day where it wipes out a bunch of people eating brunch, and then act a few seconds later like nothing happened? It's a very European dry comedy sort of punchline, tho played for straight drama. I love Julia Louise-Dreyfess, but her character was beyond insufferable.

The LJ and PK drama seemed a bit contrived, but in the books its makes more sense because treehouse gang plays a game of assassins that LJ really wants to win.

The colours and the set were nice tho, but that's the only positive thing I can say about it. I was constantly skipping by 10 seconds, the entire movie felt irrelevant.

Acting and plot were awful.", "It's hard to have a sequel to a rom com because every one of them has to have a break the 'happily ever after' feeling that you are left with in the original. And it never feels like a natural break here. A lot of the moves they make and things they said (or more didn't)  made me question the direction of the movie. Peter left out that Poe wrote the poem, not a huge mistake. But not saying he knew it was Gen who took the video was a major hiccup. Lara not mentioning her bf, obvious omission to move the plot along.\n\nEven the sex talk between Christine and Lara felt unnatural but I'm not really sure how it goes with teenagers now. Was it just me who somehow thought she was going to tell her she was pregnant rather than the picture of Gen and Peter? The anxiousness in Christine's voice is the primary thing that made me think that but it didn't flow with the direction of the movie. I will say, the conversation between Lara and Peter in the car felt much more honest and adult. Enough that I'm glad that had a define the boundaries talk that might now even happen in real life (but definitely should). The part where Noah compared Lara's mom's flirting with Lara's felt like a genuine moment.

I would have been fine with a second movie if it had focused solely on Peter and Lara Jean's relationship as a real couple and her insecurities with living up to Gen or acting like a \"typical girlfriend\" but because they wanted to do this love triangle, we spent a lot of time with a character I didn't really care about or like. No shade to John Ambrose - he seemed perfectly nice - but I was too invested in Lara Jean's relationship with Peter to be able to warm up to John. Just because the second book explores her relationship with John Ambrose doesn't mean they couldn't have changed it for the movie.\n\nI did like the scene between her and Gen though. I think that type of conversation is important for young people to see.\n\nI also liked that they seemed to highlight their Korean heritage a little more. I loved their hanboks and all the food.

The first movie felt like a charming rom com you could watch over again. I couldn't watch this mess again, I honestly got bored before the movie reached halfway. How they managed to make everyone unlikable,except for the new characters, is beyond me. Revealing that Peter wasn't waiting in the hot tub for LJ wttffff why?? That's horrible! Like \"I was actually waiting for another girl but I can make out with you I guess\" what even compelled them to add that randomly to this movie.

The only time I enjoyed her character was during the treehouse scene with Gen.

I really liked John Ambrose and thought they were the cutest thing, especially when she came as French toast and him as a deviled egg!! I feel like Peter shouldn't have been given a second chance because that would just drag on for the rest of their relationship. With John there was some as actual chemistry. I really disliked Glen because although she was going through hard times, she shouldn't be forgiven so easily? It feels like everything wasn't mended enough. I know there's another to come and it all just seems super fake.

Lara Jean\u2019s outfits and hair.\n2. The color palette and production design was on point, everything seemed so pretty, unrealistic but still pretty.\n3. More visibility to Lara Jean\u2019s Korean heritage.\n4. Peter remembering stuff Lara Jeans tells him.\n5. Lara Jean and Gen\u2019s scene was good, the jung part was a highlight in my opinion.\n6.

No offense to Jordan Fisher he is really talented, but his character was so lame, stuck in the sixth grade, he felt like Lara Jean\u2019s pet all the time, he was more in love with the thought of sixth grade Lara Jean than the actual Lara Jean. \n\n\nIn the books you are really in doubt whether you will choose John Ambrose or Peter K. \n\nJohn Ambrose was posh af, he was in a private school, had this kind of classic beauty, he was described like a [young Robert Redford](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0-wzZYN4DVGNNzyPSh6chXPZMgE-scsCyLQPXyz_sDzVSkjfV-jc5gra7&s=10). He went to see Lara Jean to school in a fancy vintage car, you totally see why Lara Jean was so appealed by him. Also he was Stormi\u2019s grandson and that created kind of a conflict of interests in Lara Jean.\n\n\nHere John Ambrose is not posh, he was only dressed up like my grandpa, he was super boring, the only part that I liked with him was when he was playing the piano, because you could see how talented Jordan Fisher is. He and Lara Jean had no development, they only liked they younger selfs of each other. It was like the \u201cwhat could have been?\u201d.\n\n\nLara Jean and Peter lacked of chemistry in this one, they didn\u2019t have like cute moments like in the first movie, all their moments involved kissing and fighting, nothing new. In this one you are rooting for Peter because he is the least worse. Also, in the books when he gives Lara Jean the heart locket it is so much thoughtful.\n\n\nThere was a lot going on in the background like Chris and Trevor and Dr. Covey and Mrs. Rothschild. Both storylines felt unnecessary.\n\n\nThe movie feels short and undeveloped. I really wanted to love this movie and John Ambrose, but ugh this was so bad. They did it all wrong, there were to many unnecessary moments and lack of development and cute moments like the last one one had.\n\n\nAlso, where is Jamie Fox-Pickle??", "I liked a couple parts. I liked that they showcased some korean heritage with the korean new year, wearing hanboks and the concept of jeong/jung was awesome. I also liked the conversation between Lara and Gen in the treehouse as I think being honest about insecurities and also  bringing up jeong with past friendships and relationships. I think it's important for young people and just everyone overall to understand that people can still care for exes but not love them and that some people can just be friends with them and not for people to be overly jealous about it too. And I liked how it showed Lara being insecure about comparing herself to past partners and feeling self conscious because it's super relatable when you're younger and inexperienced.\n\nHowever, I fell like it was no where as good as the first movie. I actually didn't like Lara that much in this movie. She was being super insecure all the time, wasn't being honest with both Peter and Ambrose, lead Ambrose on and was just being super selfish and indecisive in my opinion. Like.. I get when you're younger you tend to be more indecisive when it comes to dating and sometimes you do like more than one person... but you catch yourself and be honest with yourself when it happens THEN be honest to the other people involved. It was shitty for her to hide her relationship with Peter from Ambrose and she was obviously super infatuated when she first got the letter from Ambrose.. that part was super cringy and annoying for me and she didn't realize that it was wrong until after when she was like \"should  I tell Peter?\" Like I get you could get butterflies from past crush but she really fed into it and I was like dude... I would be upset if I knew my boyfriend was doing that when receiving a letter from a past crush LOL. And just leading Ambrose on and kissing him.... I was pretty upset about the info with Peter actually waiting for Gen in the hot tub. Like THEY weren't together yet and I know being super upset on Lara's part is kind of unfair but it's also like AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. You were waiting for another girl then made out with someone else... it just seems super indecisive on his end too HOWEVER unlike Lara he did it before they were officially dating and not while they were dating. I felt like it was also super rushed with the love triangle and just overall. I'd prefer if they slowed it down a bit if they wanted to kind of go over the topic of being confused in love and working on it and being honest with yourself because it does happen and people aren't always 100% in love with one person all the time... but it was so fast and she was just being a jerk. I would have liked it if she did more introspection and took a break to build up her self esteem and find herself more because she was mega insecure about Peter having more experience and just always made a big deal about it. As well as always wanting to be a \"good girlfriend\" and being too fixated on having a boyfriend rather than just dating? LIke I get when you first date it's cool to be dating and finally have a boyfriend and be a girlfriend... but to fixate on it and not be natural while dating is weird imo. It kind of comes off as being infatuated with the idea of being in a relationship rather than actually liking the person and caring for them genuinely. It comes off as in-genuine and like she is too much in her head.   \n\n\nI would have rated it like a 4.5/10. I think it's great for representation and whatnot but it just missed the mark for me when compared to the first.", "the way the movie was shot really won me over. absolutely gorgeous. especially the scene w lj baking those pastries for peter", "I feel like this whole movie painted Peter in a terrible light so I didn't root for them anymore. I'm made LJ took him back.

There was no other conversation other than \"I have boy problems.\" I get it's a rom-com but it felt very one dimensional compared to the first one. Hopefully number three is better.", "I think it's better when you watch the movie with low expectations. I watched the first one with my best friend after 3 cocktails and I thought it was so cute and fun but that's kind of all it was. I feel like the second wasn't as well done as the first (script, plot, etc) but I had an equally fun time watching so it's a win in my book. I haven't read the books so I feel like the Korean thing was kinda weird in the first one bc they just made like one off hand comment about it. And, as lovely as Lana Condor is she doesn't look Korean at all and neither do her siblings so I was super confused as to why it was at all relevant in the first movie (besides the author being Korean). I def appreciated how it was more incorporated in this one and thought it was super cute. Her little monologue about jung made me kinda cry at the end bc its something my mom says to me all the time.", "Is this the first sequel Netflix has ever made from one of its own films? They've talked about doing that with Death Note, Bright, etc. but never follow through.", "The director change definitely had a big effect, it lost some of the charm from the original but I enjoyed it enough with its likeable cast. The writing is weaker though, the first film ended just fine so the conflicts and character decisions in this one just feel contrived for drama, the worst kind of conflict is one feuded by just poor communication, which is basically this whole film. \n\nAt least it has a sweet ending, Matt from Until Dawn stole the show, but there wasn't any real reason for her to switch from Peter.", "I didn't know about the first one until my wife was 20 minutes into this and I missed the first part of this one but I'm convinced Kavinksky was a god damn mastermind and orchestrated this whole thing so Laura Jean would sleep with him.

The half-baked attempt at a \"love triangle\" - I feel bad for the guy playing John Ambrose sort of cause he gets nothing to do.

Sarah's friend, and riding partner, fell off of a horse and suffered irreparable brain damage resulting in memory loss and seizures.\n\nGood fucking god.  This movie is a clear articulation of experiential trauma, and the desperate attempt to place the pain anywhere else, like religious fanatics place their pain in \"God's plan.\"\n\nOnly for Sarah, God doesn't exist, and the \"plan\" is an alien plan.\n\nThis movie is about trauma and the potential delusion resulting.

I think deep down this film is exercising her worry she will become her Grandma. Which explains the clone thing in the movie.\n\nSpeaking of Alison, what a performance.\n\nI also am not sure if it was intentional but I got a very late 90s/early 2000's mid-budgey indie movie vibe about this. The way it was filmed and the soundtrack are that to a T.\n\nOverall I give it a 9/10. Only thing holding it back from a 9.5 or higher is I wish they gave more backstory on the horse. I know we got plenty but I wanted to know how they got the horse, why they sold it, (maybe the accident?), as well as why she was allowed to visit.", "I just watched a second time. And realized the film starts in Joan\u2019s memory. She\u2019s remembering a time she was working with sarah before she spiraled. She\u2019s remembering how she looked up and saw the the end of the horse while she was working on the day Sarah died. And how she could have stopped it. Horse Girl is probably the cruel nickname the people in her town gave her as she hung around the stable. Clues she\u2019s escaped more than once is when she escapes her room and goes back to her apartment where she\u2019s confronted by Nikki.

(\"If there\u2019s not a Reddit message board about this movie, I would be shocked and frankly appalled.\" -- *Hi Alison, if you're reading.*)\n\nI went into the movie cold based on the logline (\"A socially awkward woman with a fondness for arts and crafts, horses, and supernatural crime shows finds her increasingly lucid dreams trickling into her waking life.\") and was completely entranced throughout. In these types of films, I always tend to go the supernatural route and believe the characters' stories, but based on Alison Brie's own family history, and the fact that she was both co-writer and producer, I can now understand that it was an allegory for psychotic depression. (as per this [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2020/02/07/a-battle-with-depression-the-ending-of-horse-girl-explained/))\n\nThere's still a lot of information to unpack, such as the things she saw in her dreams/night terrors (people she eventually meets), the bruising pattern all over her body (is it anemia, as the ENT suggested?) and the weird scratches in the apartment. I think everything else could just be a fantasy projection, including the ending (I think she really did steal the horse and lay out in the forest). Maybe the most unbelievable part of the movie is that she would be discharged from the hospital after admitting all her intricate conspiracy theories to the doctors and numerous people in her life. The ending left me feeling really unsatisfied and worried for the character. I don't know why, but it kind of reminded me a lot of Unicorn Store.", "One weird thing I think I noticed was the phone ringing in the craft store when Sarah was sort of having an \"episode\" and Joan answering but nobody on the other line. She says \"Hello?\" several times. That happened twice. Third time the phone's ringing after Sarah shows up naked and Joan's talking to her in the back room but I don't know if the third worker answered or not, but soon after is when the phone rings again and Sarah answers and thinks she can hear the future. Don't know if that was supposed to be more than what it was.", "The more I think about this film the more I like it. I believe it is very sensitive and empathetic towards people suffering from mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, and it was really cleverly designed to show us how confusing and misleading life can be for an individual suffering from such an illness. The fact that there is much confusion and theorising regarding the film in this thread further signals to the effectiveness of the film. I think the film is a narrative of the events from Sarah's perspective as she falls deeper into her mental illness, and that is why it is confusing \u2013 we are experiencing her confusion and hallucinations/delusions with her. Since her perception of reality is flawed by her delusions, she is an unreliable narrator, leading to unexplained confusing events occurring, such as >!the hindquarters of the horse being seen by Joan at the beginning and end of the film!<. We are effectively experiencing Sarah's reality, raw and unfiltered. This adds all the more impact to the sadness of her situation, as we can empathise a little more with her and others like her.\n\n I find the way the film ended to be somewhat hopeful and optimistic, if in a twisted way. She appears to have finally found her version of freedom and peace, although the path to finding it was tragic and detrimental.\n\nAlison Brie's performance was exceptional, and I love the way this movie was filmed.

Behind that search page is another search for NARCOLEPSY, in the article on that page there is the word alien and also the words power lines. There were powerlines above the payphone. She probably has narcolepsy which explains why time doesnt seem linear. She's dreaming. We see her zone out a lot in the movie, one time in particular when visiting mom in beginning. The zoning out could be when she falls asleep. This movie is a blend of reality and dreams. The things she sees when awake make their way into her dreams. \n\nBut what do I know. Here's some other stuff to play with...\n\nShe mentions to roommate that her mom always said she has an overactive imagination.\n     \nThe mark of Hades appears on the show Pergatory, on the card that the tarot lady buying the fabric gives her, and in the sky in final scene of movie. \n   \nThere's a number of butterfly pictures in her home. Butterflies can have many meanings... Endurance and change; resurrection, etc. And theres a horsefly over the door   she walks through naked. Horseflies also carry many symbolisms. One is that the horsefly demonstrates properties of spiritual healing and enlightenment with knowledge.\n\nWhen she leaves the hospital and she is watching herself from window that's an indication that she's really still there and dreaming she's leaving.\n\nWhen she gets home and is with hospital roommate the picture of butterflies above table is replaced with the circle pic that was over couch in past scenes.\n    \nDarren from her party has the same voice as Ethan at the mental health facility.\n   \n When nurse was doing her intake she asks Sarah what are some things that could keep her from hurting herself. Sarah answers, her horse and her job.\n     \nThroughout the movie there are so many associations with horses...in the very beginning of movie Sarah and Joan are speaking of those Irish dancers and how the top of them stays straight but they're legs move around like crazy (like a horse) and that point is repeated a couple times; When she dances with Darren it was like she was riding a horse; The woman in the locker room that she looks at with interest has long hair with her ears sticking out; The instructor has big teeth (watch her at the end of there convo)...Her roommate has same hair as Willow. That's just a few. \n\n  That funny convo at the party about the bakers dozen, the roommates boyfriend REPEATEDLY says Its a concept album! Its a concept album! A concept album is defined as one whose tracks holds a larger meaning collectively than they do individually. Sounds like a little wink to us from the writers.\n        \n Her obsession with guy she was kind of stalking and whom she has subconsciously seen and then dreamed of may have something to do with her never knowing her father, which she mentioned in mental health facility.\n \nEverything kinda goes downhill for her after she sees her friend which I think happened before the party after she made the anklet when she was awake.\n\nSarah had nose bleeds which may be linked to her mom. Nosebleeds are common with excessive use of medications, and when mother is found in bathroom you see a ton of pill bottles. You also see a bowl filled with round beads. At work she zones out washing her blood off beads.  \n     \nHer mother is lying face down with pillows next to her. Her friend also fell face down with her arm twisted behind her back. Sarah was in same exact position when waking up after her party... but she was on pillows.\n     \nProtection, safety, and comfort are big themes throughout the movie, which ties to her wishing she could have protected those close to her.\n   \n  A few times at work you could hear Joan answer phone in background and say hello a couple of times because caller said nothing on other end. When Sarah found herself near payphone she got home and saw missed call on cell phone. She called herself. When Gary calls her she says hello a couple times before he answers, same as Joan.\n    \n  Roommate in hospital has issues with sleep and time as well. \n\nSarah crochets squares and hangs them around her home. In final scene she places one around Willow's neck. Squares have four points which could symbolize north, south, east and west. Having direction helps you find you're way when you're lost.\n\n     \n In an interview with Allison Brie, star and co-writer, she says her grandmother had schizophrenia. Allison mentions her struggle with wondering if mental illness will eventually find her as well. With that comes the idea that one could become obsessed with the fear of becoming mentally ill which could drive them mad thus becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.", "it's probably because i have a long history of working in a psychiatric hospital, but this movie wasn't up to interpretation IMO, it was clearly about a young female with schizophrenia (paranoid delusions). the ending was another delusion. she didn't kill herself.", "I just finished watching it and wow. I was pretty scared when the boyfriend found her staring at the wall in the first half. Alison did an amazing job and my heart ached for her as the symptoms got worse and worse. I wasn't expecting to get emotional but the scene where Sarah loses time and steps into the store she works at naked -- the way she called for Joan just gutted me.

One of the times she escaped, just like she did in her dream. \n\nAll of the things she is seeing, her \u201cdreams\u201d are actually distorted memories she has, and I think her psychotic episodes are triggered by water/related things.

Theres also scratches in her car when she goes into the white room (52:10) after stalking the plumber but it shows her waking up as if she was in a lucid dream rather than abducted, the scratches in the car could have been made with car keys but not sure about the car scratches\n\nCLUE 5 - when she tells darren about \"statico satellites\" the ones responsible for sending aliens messages, this is also what the homeless man says that runs into her earlier in the film (he says statico technology), shes repeating what she heard the homeless man saying\n\nCLUE 6 - water is a trigger for her mental illness, the shower was running when her mum died, the shower was running when she had a breakdown and walked into the store naked, theres pipes in her lucid dream, and the man shes obsessed with from her dream is a plumber\n\nCLUE 7 - after leaving heathers (the friend who had the horse accident) and reminded of witnessing that trauma she stops in her car and stars out at the green water tanks (at 31:50) (water her mental illness trigger because it reminds her of second trauma she witnessed her mum dying and the shower running). these are the same green water tanks her \"stolen\" car is later found at and she says she doesnt know where the water tanks are, again proving its something she did herself.\n\nCLUE 8 - The car is never stolen she really gets out of the car and leaves it near the water tanks and walks home. The last thing we see is her staring at the water tanks inside her car (see clue 8), then it cuts to her being in a daze staring at the kitchen sink with the water running and looks confused, then the next morning she goes to garage and her car is not there so she says its stolen but she really just left it at the water tanks. (again water is a trigger, this is also the same sink she later gets the plumber to fix). the tow man also says it wasn't stollen someone left the car running with the keys in ignition and it ran out of gas, when he says this sarah smiles and looks away, she then has a quick flashback remembering she was staring at the water tanks\n\nCLUE 9 - shes never abducted, everytime she thinks shes been abducted she has been around water her mental illness trigger (water tanks, shower) the water reminds her of trauma (her mother dying with the shower running) or before shes in the white room she sees a shower curtain and a running shower for a split second before you see her in the white room and once shes triggered she \"looses time\" and forgets what she did during that time because shes in a mentally ill state and never abducted\n\nPossible clue? - she says she looks the same as her grandma but she has the dress from the photo, what if its just a black and white photo of herself and not her grandma\n\nOTHER THINGS EXPLAINED-\n\nWhy does she hear the future? She doesnt she just THINKS shes does, her beliefs are real to her. Theres a few points in the movie Joan answers the phone at work and keeps saying \u201chello, hello, hello\u201d and its clear noone is there, Sarah is also answering a blank call she doesnt really hear anything she just thinks she does\n\nWhy does she see a different roommate and have sex with two different men, hear voices in next room - these are just lucid dreams at this point in the movie\n\nWHY JOAN SEES THE HORSE EXPLAINED\n\n\nFirstly Joan never sees Sarah walk the horse she just sees the horse. Sarah actually steals the horse twice. The first time she takes it to work and its walking around which explains why Joan sees the horse. It also explains the conversation with the therapist who said she was there weeks before in the mental institution talking about her horse. You got to remember the scenes are out of order I think everyone forgets this. It also explains why the stable managers dont trust her because they know she stole the horse and went into the mental institution they know shes unwell. The actors/directors have always said this movie is about lucid dreams/depression/schizophrenia there is no supernatural element its just what sarah wants to believe so she doesnt have to accept shes going crazy, thats why theres a mark of hades at the end to show its not really aliens beaming her up its her surrendering to going nuts, the mark of hades was from her tv show proving its her mind not aliens. She also got the theory of cloning from her tv show proving again its all in her mind. The director also put a flash of a shower curtain/running shower before every \u201cabduction\u201d to show its just in sarahs mind just a lucid dream not an abduction. The shower curtain/running shower refers to the trauma of seeing her mum commit suicide. Also all this starts after she smokes weed, weed is known to set off schizophrenia. The supernatural element was meant to feel real to emphasise how real delusions are to mentally ill people but its never actually real shes just mentally ill. People forget too the director said the whole movie is subjective reality meaning every scene is not real every scene is how sarah sees everything, what sarah believes everything looks like so the photograph of her grandmother in reality probably looks nothing like her but in sarahs reality she believes it does. Also noone ever tells sarah her grandmother believed she was from the future her family just tell her she talked to the walls, sarah makes this up because she wants that to be the reality she doesnt wanna accept shes going crazy. The whole movie is how sarah sees things not whats actually real. Its all subjective reality.", "Not at all what I was expecting but I liked it overall. That Allison Brie co-wrote it about her family\u2019s history with mental illness made me like it more. I\u2019m confused about one part though (that seems like a non-event but has stuck with me). Why are the stable owners so annoyed by her presence if she\u2019s obviously known them since she was a young girl? What did the owner, Joe, mean when he said Willow wasn\u2019t her horse anymore? Is it possible they know of her mental state? Growing up riding horses, there were always bystanders that would behave in similar manners as Sarah and give advice to riders. The girl she tried to give guidance to was straight up rude. Just bugged me.", "I  think I understand the message of the movie. The therapist summed it up perfectly when he acknowledged her delusions and confabulations as legitimate and real to her, WITHOUT judgement. He showed compassion and acceptance while also making sure not to enable her by validating it. He made it clear that he was skeptical to her claims. \n\nWe often marginalize or ignore the mentally ill. Our streets are filled up with homeless people suffering from severe delusions and rather than putting them down we should feel empathy for them and understand that the hell they live in is as real as our reality - empathy would go a long way.", "At the very end of the movie, before the scene cuts back to Willow grazing, there's a shot of the sky and for a brief second the sky is actually the fabric that is being cut in the opening sequence. Which could further the theory of time loops.", "I saw so many negative reviews online and I\u2019m honestly confused because this movie is super good. Maybe it\u2019s just \u201ctoo weird\u201d for some people. \n\nAnyone got theories about the ending? Was it supposed to be a metaphor for suicide or \u2018just\u2019 one of her delusions?", "Thought it was interesting that someone on IMDB pointed out that the two main color palettes in the movie are the blue-grey (when Sarah's feeling more lucid), and peach tones (when she's feeling less lucid).\n\nKinda find it ironic that the woman says the peach has a protective, calming effect on many of her customers. Seems to have the exact opposite for Sarah.\n\nEDIT: Also notice that really odd lighting in the smoking scene. Darren is illuminated by that peach and Sarah is illuminated by blue. Contrast feels really stark.", "It's helpful to know Alison Brie \\[SPOILER, KIND OF\\] says she was inspired by her own grandmother's schizophrenia, and her fear of it being passed on. She talked about this at the Sundance premiere:\n\n[Source](https://www.moviemaker.com/horse-girl-alison-brie/)\n\nSo I agree with the posters who say this is a very empathetic portrayal of what it's like to have schizophrenia. She doesn't know if she's the only person seeing the true reality, or if she's the only one NOT seeing the true reality. You can imagine the depths of loneliness she's in not knowing if she's even in the same reality as everyone else.\n\nShe's also explicitly said the movie isn't at all intended as a comedy, and that that's one of the misconceptions about it.", "Can we talk about the amazing ambient music? Especially the one where she is in her tailored outfit before the sex scene and she's walking ominously through her neighborhood.", "i loved the movie.  serious donnie darko vibes.  through the entire movie, i felt extremely insecure, which i can imagine what it is like to have a mental illness.  i enjoy that the movie keeps it open to different perspectives (mental illness, time loop, aliens) , exploring the different sides to this movie is interesting.  but ultimately, the feeling it gave me triumphs whatever it's supposed to mean.  10/10", "I thought it was a very well made film about schizophrenia from the POV of a sufferer, that was clever enough to keep you looking for clues to work out if there's any reality to her delusions... until I saw the repeated shot of Sarah leading the horse through the car park at the start and end of the film which shows there's a time loop involved. In the second shot, you can see the back of Sarah's head in the store... while she's also outside, dressed as her grandma, leading the horse.\n\nThe director has confirmed the time loop and alien abduction stuff was real, and that turns the film into sci-fi. Sarah is ill, but her suffering seems to be a bit cheapened. I can't help thinking the film would've been more powerful if it had been ambiguous, so we couldn't tell what events are real and what's in her head. Just my two cents.", "the point is you can be both mentally Ill and be abducted by aliens who throw you into a time loop. The end.", "I knew absolutely nothing about the movie except Alison Brie was in it. Up until the birthday party, I thought it would be an indie romantic dramedy about a lonely girl. Imagine my surprise when it went all Lynch-ian and turned into an art house movie where you don't know what's real and what's not.\n\nLoved the score.", "So I totally understand the me tall illness theories, but how does one explain her coworker spotting the horse at the opening and close? Unless that coworker isn't real?", "I think the horse represented her sanity. It was taken away and although she tries to get her meantal health back throughout the movie she keeps getting resistance from everyone involved. At the end she says that she knows what she has to do, and she kidnaps the horse representing her last ditch effort to going back to normal, but it fails. When she disappears and the horse is left alone we\u2019re supposed to understand that she\u2019s far removed from ever becoming mentally sane again, she and the horse are on different planes.", "I have just watched this film and I have many questions", "Can anyone figure out what the voices in the walls were talking about? It sort of sounded like the voices of the nurses.", "Did no one else notice that the shower head running was a trigger for her losing time and not remembering how she ended up in different places? The scene showing her mum dead had a shower head running.", "Since they present her as probably schizophrenic, I wonder if the scene where they\u2019re all smoking weed was supposed to be relevant to her worsening of psychotic symptoms", "Usually movies don't scare me (even horror movies), but this one has me super creeped out. The psychotic montage scene after she walks out of her hospital door were outstanding.", "This movie was frighteningly real for me as someone living with a severe mental illness. I watched it with a friend, not knowing what I was getting into. Waking up in unfamiliar places. Googling \"time loss\". Meeting people for the first time when they clearly know you... Yikes. \n\nOne thing that really stood out to me was the scene where the customer at the store told her about that color being protective. I'm sure to that customer it seemed like such an innocent interaction, but it ended up becoming an important part of her delusion. The same goes for the date casually talking about ancient aliens and conspiracy theories. People can accidentally feed into your mental illness in ways that can end up becoming quite harmful. Sometimes I struggle with trying to explain to people why I can't just casually engage in theorizing about conspiracies or the paranormal. When people make jokes about the paranormal or predicting the future it makes me so uneasy, because I don't want to add any fuel to that fire.", "First of all, if you enjoyed this movie, go and watch Starfish (2019). It\u2019s incredible!\n\nLiterally just finished watching Horse Girl. I loved it. I had zero expectations, not high or low, and I didn\u2019t see any trailers so I went into it blind and I really enjoyed it. It reminds me of Donnie Darko, which I might rewatch shortly. I really love how you literally don\u2019t know anything about the abductions thing until halfway through or so and most of it keeps swaying between whether she\u2019s mentally ill or is actually being abducted, and her na\u00efvet\u00e9 and pretty unusual social skills makes it hard for anyone to take her seriously, especially given the subject of the matter.\n\nIn the end, it all makes sense, why she wears her grandma\u2019s clothes, why she behaves the way she does, why she\u2019s so awkward about revealing clothes and even her super nice attitude that seems rather like it\u2019s someone from a 1940s movie. And still even with that, the movie makes her seem either like a person who\u2019s stuck in a time paradox of being their own grandmother or a person with a severe mental illness that tried so hard to maintain their sanity and reality just came crashing down halfway through.\n\nShe comes off as super kind and innocent and yet every one seems to be taken aback from her especially her roommate\u2019s boyfriend and the horse stable people, for some reason. It made me really feel bad for her, and that scene with Darren when she freaks out, I was like \u201cugh this is gonna damage her. Just when things started to work out for her\u201d. I also loved how she and Darren clicked from the start. \n\nI wonder if the ending was implying that she was abducted to the Aliens\u2019 homeworld or she was being taken to the past so she could live out her cycle, which was that of her grandmother (her) and if she\u2019s now pregnant with Darren\u2019s child which is her mother.", "I dont think she ever truly was discharged from the hospital.  They show her watching herself from the hospital window as she is leaving.", "I believe that this is about mental illness and nothing else. The cloning, the aliens, the abduction... it's just her mental illness at work. But that's just how I view it. As someone with anxiety/depression, I felt this at a deeper level and understood everything about it. I also used to sleepwalk. They captured exactly what it \"feels\" like. Really cool movie.", "Ok, so for those saying schizophrenia and stuff, near the ending Joan see\u2019s the end of the horse walk by the store and is confused, the exact same scene is in the very beginning of the movie but with Sarah in the store with her; Joan sees the end of the horse walk by and looks confused.", "I\u2019m really surprised this movie has been getting such mixed reviews. I was really impressed! It reminded me a bit of The Bell Jar in that it really places the viewer in the protagonist\u2019s shoes as they struggle to hold on to reality, which makes you really empathize with them. I felt so awful for Sarah, and I understood her loneliness and anxiety. Alison Brie did an amazing job! I wasn\u2019t crazy about the ending, and a few things were left unexplained (probably intentional), but this was a really well crafted movie about mental illness! Would definitely recommend it.", "The Director Jeff and Alison Brie did an official Q & A on reddit about horse girl for anyone that hasnt seen it\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/f4hbnh/were_jeff_baena_and_alison_brie_from_the_netflix/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nThey confirmed there is a time loop, there is aliens, and shes having a schizophrenic breakdown all at the same time. The scenes with blue lighting are reality/the aliens and the scenes with peach lighting represent her schizophrenia. They also confirmed there is two sarahs when joan sees her walking the horse because there is a time loop. The end scene the sky turns into blue fabric this represents the time loop because the first scene is sarah cutting into blue fabric\n\nSo Jeff the director also said this was also written because hes seen UFO\u2019s 3 times and also had vivid dreams of being abducted.... so... not sure what to make of that!", "I think this was a really real way to show how people with mental illness are treated. \n\n1. The only true connection she had left in her life was to Willow, but the barn workers treated her like an annoyance, even though it was clear that she was lonely. She was literally visiting a horse that she couldn\u2019t even legally ride anymore. Obviously she was lonely. But they still made her feel so unwanted.\n\n2. Her roommate, although made an effort to help her be social, obviously judged her and made her feel like a loser for not having friends. You can tell this by the way she lies about having plans that fell through on her birthday. She also freaks out at her when she\u2019s getting new plumbing in the kitchen. Obviously there was something wrong with the situation, especially because she was using a fake name, but she just reacts by making her feel bad. Her boyfriend also makes comments about her sleepwalking, almost making fun of her to Darren.\n\n3. Darren abandons her at the graveyard, and her roommate angrily confronts her about the date. If someone is telling you they think they are a clone and literally take you to a graveyard to dig up their mother to take a DNA sample, they obviously need immediate mental help. I understand that he\u2019s freaked out, but he does nothing to help her. He could of at least told the roommate that she needed help. Instead, he complained to them about it and they confronted her instead of helping her.\n\n4. The mental health facility did nothing to help her. She was obviously not any better when they released her. If anything, the things she was saying when he discharged her were scarier. Yet, all he did was tell her to please go to her follow-up appointment, which she is clearly not capable of doing in her state. The way he talks to her also rubbed me the wrong way. Like when she talks about alien abductions and he tells her he doesn\u2019t believe in them, instead of just listening to her. He almost sounds annoyed when he\u2019s talking to her. Like he\u2019s brushing her off.\n\n5. The ENT doctor treats her like he can\u2019t be bothered to deal with her. He\u2019s a doctor and his patient is telling him that she thinks she\u2019s a clone, and he is very clearly uncomfortable and tries to end the appointment. She obviously has a mental illness, and he does nothing to help her. That was heartbreaking. \n\nI think the time loops in the movie are Sarah\u2019s way to cope with her mental illness. There are no actual time loops. We are just seeing things from Sarah\u2019s perspective, which is not how things are actually happening in reality. The psychotic episodes are triggered by water because she finds her mother dead next to a running shower, which is why she wakes up staring at running water and why she\u2019s so obsessed with the plumber. I think she was in and out of the mental facility, but because of her mental breaks, it was all one visit in her mind, and moments may have been out of order. The alien abductions weren\u2019t real. She was just seeing those people in real life, without remembering it, and having lucid dreams about them.", "I thought it\u2019s one of the best and most sympathetic depictions of mental illness, especially within a psychological thriller. People are weirdly critical about this movie.", "So I interpret the movie as a visual depiction of what she experienced, from the point of view of her reconsolidated memory at least a week after the final scene of the movie. Mixing up the sequence of events is not uncommon in a psychotic break and even regular in regular life, and the movie is presenting that.\n\nBy the first time she hospitalized (show later in the movie, but actually the first time,  because she eventually remembers it as the first time), she's has trouble remembering things (she's been there 72 hours, not a day).\n\nThen lots of stuff that was dreams that could have during that time or the following week.\n\nThe she gets out, steals a horse, and literally doesn't remember anything else. (Movie ends).\n\nA week later she's in the hospital again (presented to the audience as the first time, because that's how she remembers it). At first she  doesn't recognize her social worker from a week ago. \n\nA short time later after still being psychotic, she misremembers the order of events and has false memories of her telling the social worker she saw him a week ago which matches her time travel narrative.", "Also I feel that SUICIDE is a SAD assumption that is being made here by such a high number of people?\n\nAs if that is the best that could be hoped for someone sick as she is? We did not see her die, she denied suicidal thoughts and had no idea how she would kill herself when asked, meaning no plan- it would have to be an impulse.\n\nBut with her HIGH on her DELUSIONS and free from CAPTIVITY her impulses were steal a horse and run off.\n\nDeath may END her suffering, but that is not the only potential outcome.\n\nI do not see the \"SUICIDE\" vs \"ALIEN TIME LORDS\" as the best options.\n\nMentally ill people also can get on a path to recovery. Which may take years. And sometimes more than one influence.\n\nSarah clearly got sicker in the end of the film, so not recovering, but that's just the end of the tinnnnnny look we got into this person's life.\n\nI don't want to feel like the world sees people like her as hopeless so we treat suicide as bitter-sweet.\n\nThis girls grandma died young and homeless, failed by our system and you know obviously she lacked family support. No real family lets their own die on the street even if they are hard to deal with by not being able minded or bodied.\n\nThen her mother commits suicide and not much was said of it other than she took pills. Her father is MIA but Gary had money, which didn't save her mom from her depression. He was able to keep helping Sarah in her life after the fact but he was not someone she called often it seems.\n\nMeaning she must deal with a lot of guilt\n\nWhich yes guilty feeling people kill themselves but her psychosis in the end was fueling her escapism in a different manner.\n\nTo me it looks like the film ended the way most people's relationships with people like Sarah end.\n\nWithout knowing if she will be okay, just that she could be, maybe, if she is lucky. Whatever she needs, she hasn't fully grasped it yet. And right now (end of film) she is not CAPABLE of grasping it.\n\nBut she could be. I want to have hope for her because I want to have hope for myself. I want to see a world where someone like her gets better and is accepted and welcomed and supported, instead of branded and labled the rest of her life as the unhelpable horse girl.\n\nI mean no disrespect to people who go through that in any way, but not every mentally ill person is suicidal. I'm not 100% ruling it out. I just don't see it.\n\nSorry for ranting this just bugs me.", "Well damn. That was a quite a ride (maybe that's pun intended?). \n\nI agree with most so far that it doesn't really have one set theory in particular.  \n\nWhat I think is interesting is the dark horse candidate theory (I'll stop) in that Allison was/or turned into the horse. If that was really her grandmother traveling through time than it would make sense to try and enforce how someone else rides her, and to protect her in the peach colored everything.  \n\nOne of the few movies I really like where I'm not too concerned what theory is \u201cright\u201d. Also Allison Brie was amazing in this from screenplay to acting.", "1. Why was the horse no longer hers? The only thing I can think of is that she was blamed in some way for her friend's life-altering accident, but I don't think that would be the case.\n2. Why do the people working at the stables treat her like as though she's dangerous, or at least threatening in some way? It seemed to be less \"oh jeez, she's back to see the damn horse again\" and more \"oh shit... play it cool, don't set her off\", like she had done something crazy before that we aren't privy to.", "Loved the pastel color palette--carried throughout basically the whole film. And the thought that went into some of those fabric shots wow", "I actually liked this movie a lot. I thought it'd be about a girl with supernatural powers, or at least believes she does, but was so engrossed in it once it was presented as a film about mental health. The birthday party was so sweet and charming and fun and it gave so much weight that was carried all the way through the film. As someone else has mentioned, it's an artsy film that avoids being artsy for the sake of it, but says something and that something will be different to everyone who watches it. There are so many theories and viewpoints on what actually happened throughout the film presented in this thread and I don't doubt you'll form your own one too. \n\nAlison Brie was truly phenomenal in this. The way she tries holding it together when she first comes clean to Joan about what was happening was very wrenching. I don't think there was any scene off the top of my head that she didn't own, even after having watched several hours ago. Her flirting at her party, her concern and love for her ex horse, finding common ground on conspiracies with Deren before flipping out when he didn't actually believe in any of it, Brie was spectacular. I don't mean to overshadow the rest of the cast, they were all really great in their roles (Joan was so sweet of a character!) but the film does follow Brie's Sarah almost exclusively and it doesn't falter for doing so.\n\nOne facet of the film I really like was how we aren't presented with detailed relationships that Sarah has with characters. When Garry was introduced, for example, Brie doesn't go \"Hi step-dad\" or so similar introduction like other films might do; the film just goes, \"Here's Sarah, here's her world after this day.\" Love it and the film.\n\nI would recommend.", "went into this movie 100% blind and I absolutely loved it. It\u2019s so uncomfortable but so good. it\u2019s like a car crash you can\u2019t look away from.", "At the end of the film, I was frustrated, confused, angry and questioning what was reality in the movie and what was in Sarah's head....\n....which is pretty much exactly how someone feels when they have mental illness. So whether you liked the end of the movie or not, it was effective! \nPeople who are known to be mentally ill will almost never believed even when they are telling the truth. A good example of this depicted in film is the limited series 'Unbelievable' starring Kaitlyn Dever.  \nWe wonder if Sarah is being gaslighted or if there's some truth to her alien abduction/clone story. We never know, just as someone who is mentally ill will always question their reality. Check out the animated series 'Undone' on Amazon which deals with similar issues. (I loved 'Undone' by the way and it had excellent character development with the main protagonist, Alma) As others have noted, 'Horse Girl' started out strong and had me hooked and then it went off the deep end and I thought \"oh this is actually the worst movie I've ever seen\" until I realized WHY it went so off. It was uncomfortable to watch and effective and ultimately, I liked it more than I disliked it.  I want to watch it again to see what I pick up after a second viewing. It's meant to provoke discussion. Must commend Alison Brie's performance; she was excellent!", "I too thought this would be a romantic comedy. Then I thought it would be a weird drama in which a girl finds out she has horse DNA. Then I thought it would strictly be a commentary on mental illness. Then I realised it was a mixture between the latter and an alien abduction drama. \n\nI liked it a lot, but felt a bit let down by the end. Not sure why really - I guess Brie's portrayal of a deeply troubled young woman really got to me, and I began relating her turmoil to people I have met, and to myself to an extent. And that may be why the ending, which was so utterly uncoupled from reality and seems to vindicate her illness, left me a bit cold.", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s odd that she found her dead mother and injured friend in the same position.", "At first I thought that there was no way this could all be in her head, but after reflecting on the movie as a whole for a little while, it's pretty obvious that it's all in her head. She's suffering from paranoid schizophrenia (or something that presents similarly) and I believe that the final scene >!was her committing suicide!<. I think the movie presents a really good perspective into the mind of someone suffering from schizophrenia, where every little detail somehow supports their delusions. It makes the audience search for those little details and clues the same way that Sarah was searching for them.\n\nImmediately after watching my first thought was that the aliens came for her. Then I thought about it a bit and realized how much it sounds like one of my grandmother's paranoid ramblings. She suffers from an undiagnosed mental illness that we (her family) believe is paranoid schizophrenia. She believes that the CIA is watching her (they're not), her first husband is in witness protection (he left her for another woman), and that my mother and I are clones attempting to spy on her (we look a lot alike, but are not clones!). \n\nHonestly it just hit so close to home and it's an amazing, realistic, and empathetic portrayal of a person suffering from severe mental illness, which is very rare. I loved that the movie indulges her delusions and really makes us believe that she's right about everything and is actually having these experiences with aliens, time loops, and clones. Mental illness is often portrayed in either a very safe way that we are supposed to empathize with, or in a very dangerous way. This does both, where we empathize with Sarah and we want her to be right, but we can see how dangerous her delusions are.\n\nOverall, great movie. Weird and difficult watch, but it blew my mind.", "So I know in the opening scene she was talking to her coworker and the man from the pipe business walks by the window which explains why she sees him in her dreams as she probably sees him but never really noticed him, but how exactly does the other girl she see, who later turns out to be her roommate appear in her dream.\n\nEdit: To clarify her roommate in the hospital not Jessie lol.", "r/horsegirlfilm has been started to continue the discussions and fulfill Alison Brie's prediction for a subreddit on her movie lol.\n\n\"Do you want people to be on Reddit, picking this movie apart?\nIf there\u2019s not a Reddit message board about this movie, I would be shocked and frankly appalled.

But that was not a dream....she was actually awake hallucinating she was in her apartment when really she was talking to her hospital roommate in the hospital room. The roommate was freaking out about how she got out and mad about it not cause she was worried, but she wants to know how she got out so she can get out too.", "I enjoyed ***Horse Girl***. I have a perspective on the film that I would like to get some feedback on, so here it goes.\n\nFor  starters, I like to experiment with different philosophical views, and  lately I have been experimenting with a view where our experiences (our  perceptions of the world, our feelings, our thoughts, etc) are not a ***representation of reality***, but are instead something like a ***response to reality***.  So this response (our experience) is something that we're socialized to  have and it is related to our pursuits of our various  physical/emotional needs, desires, goals, passions, values, etc and it  builds on the history of human experience that came before us.\n\nAnd the idea of ***reality*** isn't really referring to anything specific, *we have this idea of reality only because it's useful to have*, not because there really is One True Reality.\n\nThe  most blunt way to say it is to suggest that everything every person  experiences is a hallucination. (By the way, you can check out any  number of TED talks that riff on this theme.)\n\nObviously,  we can consider there to be quite a bit of consistency or coherence or  overlap among our hallucinations. We can even play around with the idea  that on some deep level, we are working together to collectively  hallucinate what we typically think of as \"consensus reality.\"\n\nBut  the thing about \"consensus reality\" is that we know that people often  see things differently from each other in relatively insignificant ways,  so consensus reality is never exactly the same for everybody. For  example, we can remember the dress that some people saw as white/gold  and some people saw as blue/black. MY hallucination/experience can be  one way and YOUR hallucination/experience can be different, but mostly  these are trivial differences. We can still go about our business with  our slightly different hallucinated version of the collective  hallucination and the little differences aren't disruptive to whatever  it is we want to accomplish that day.\n\nSometimes, though, MY hallucination may be one way and YOUR hallucination may be different in SIGNIFICANT ways. In ***Horse Girl***,  it's as if Sarah's hallucination/experience has become uncoupled from  the collective hallucination in a significant way that is disruptive and  traumatic.\n\nSo when commenters and  reviewers get hung up on whether the aliens are REAL or not, in this  view I am exploring, the answer is that nothing is EXACTLY REAL (we  don't know what reality is). In this view, we are all hallucinating  everything, it's just that most people's hallucinations coincide with everybody else's to the point where we can function alongside of each other as we go about our business. Sarah's hallucination/experience has become out  of step with the collective hallucination. The people in her community  are all pursuing their own goals and tasks and Sarah is too, but Sarah's  hallucination/experience has become so uncoupled from the more  mainstream collective hallucination that it becomes unmanageable for  Sarah and the community to function together.\n\nThis is a perspective on the movie that I find helpful, though I wouldn't suggest that it's the One True Way of Interpreting It.\n\nI  have more to say about relating the specific details of the movie to  this view, but I wanted to take the time to set up the background and  see if people are interested before getting deeper into it.", "I like it. Very original.", "Did Netflix even promote this film??

Clearly Joan is saying what Sarah thinks she hasn\u2019t heard yet due to her time distortion caused by her psychosis state.

What do all well meaning people say to the depressed \u2018your safe\u2019 \u2018No one is coming after you\u2019 etc. Sarah, unable to voice this expression in to words can only say \u2018I hear the future\u2019 as if to say \u2018I already know what you\u2019re going to say because I\u2019ve heard it all before\u2019", "Well that was wierd.", "What were those scratches on the wall from!?", "Fantastic movie.

I think Ethan knew what was happening but he could only do so much for her within his job qualifications, and then had to refer Sara elsewhere for help.

After watching the film then checking out the video Alison Brie posted on her instagram in which she mentions her grandmother's mental illness was a source of inspiration, it seems to me that it's supposed to be read both ways: ie, the ending was just another hallucination (Sarah doesn't really ascend into the sky), and it was real: once she knew the truth she was released. \n\nIt was as if Brie was saying, let's respect what my grandmother believed was real. Maybe her delusions were correct. Maybe she was right about it all. Or, maybe, she didn't have the support she needed in her life, existed in a time where her mental health wasn't taken seriously, and retreated into her own mind to a disordered degree. It's a mark of empathy, really, to create this character of Sarah, acknowledge that maybe the \"crazy\" people aren't crazy, while also portraying them in a way that the audience feels so terribly for her for not being able to get, or ask for, the help she really needs. We want what is best for Sarah. We want her to, essentially, feel better. And she does. She creates her own reality. It's not good, or bad, really. She's free.", "What can be said about the scratches?", "I think the time looping and the fact that Joan sees the horse twice is a metaphor for how generational mental illness can be just as much about cycles of trauma as they can genetic predisposition.

Maybe it\u2019s suggesting that the trauma of Sarah\u2019s breakdown and suggested suicide has moved the cycle of trauma out of the family and onto Joan, and we\u2019re left to imagine how she\u2019d go on to deal with it without the added factor of any inherited illness?", "\nMy interpretation of the movie even though nobody asked\n\nPortraying how unbelievably real a mental illness can be to someone that suffers from them, no matter how \u201ccrazy\u201d it sounds. It can be very disabling to those who have it, and how horribly it is treated here in the US. It literally shows you how a \u201cnormal\u201d person feels like with a mental disorder. It\u2019s a good movie with a very deep message, to me at least. \n\nIt shows you that a person with a mental disorder can even make you feel like what they\u2019re hallucinating is very true, and if you didn\u2019t know any better, you would believe them just by the way they present their thoughts and by the way they vocalize their emotions. It can even make you doubt the possibility of it being unreal. It can put you in doubt even for a second, and that\u2019s what\u2019s scary.", "Here's a particularly bad take on Horse Girl from [Forbes.com](https://Forbes.com).

However, I do think the film tried to lend itself to interpretation. I also think Joan was having some sort of flashback/reminiscing about Sarah in the beginning, and the image of the horse she saw on the day that Sarah presumably died/was abducted invaded that memory. \n\nI think the movie overall had a very interesting, non-linear narrative perspective, which I always like to see. However, it kind of felt flat as the film went on. A little bit like the film didn\u2019t know what it should be or not?

Her fear and ANXIETY (unfamiliar people) preceded her ascension (ramp) to ufo ship (accomplishment). She and others can see the writing on the wall... or scratches. Everyone could see the wall scratches in the movie but only she knew that it was from her ABDUCTION (accomplishment) and others thought it was her being abnormal. \n\nShe meets the unfamiliar people from dream in real life, symbolizing reassurance and believing in herself. The ABDUCTION is real. She meets female co-abductee in the hospital at the end of movie, now knowing what she believed all along is true, and discarding all anxiety. \n\nNow she is able to surrender to UFO (accomplishment) and her \u201cfuture\u201d she claimed to hear over the phone.

However, I was wondering if anyone mentioned anything about parallel universes. I heard a quick mention in the movie about parallel universes when Sarah was listening to a podcast or something. Maybe the different white light doors on the alien ship at the end lead to different universes. This would explain why she had different roommates at one point (different ones in her apartment during that \"dream\" sequence and waking up next to the girl at the hospital.) It would also explain why 1) the doctor doesn't remember saying that they met before and 2) possibly why the guy from her \"dreams\" can't remember her since it is a different doctor and/or pipes guy.\n\nAlso, maybe Joan seeing Sarah and the horse at the end was a Mandela effect where she remembers/sees stuff from a different universe.\n\nEDIT: Grammar", "Does anyone have any theories about what purpose the sex scene served? Or even what the whole dream sequence meant as a whole?", "I just saw this movie and my favourite theories are about how Sarah's detached from consensus reality and that her character arc revolves around her accepting depression and a reality not based on escaping sadness.  Some people think the movie is about a flawed support system for mental illness. Still, I disagree on the basis that most of the supporting characters were very aware, cautious, yet kind about Sarah's issues. After all, Joan **knows** about Sarah's mother and advises her to consult a doctor. Nikki, the roommate, also tries to help Sarah socialize.

Small details like Harley tossing Dinah a hair tie in the middle of a brawl made me really happy with the director. \n\nDISLIKED:\n\n-While the acting and action was great, the script definitely wasn't perfect, especially some of the dialogue. With so many characters and ideas being thrown around, the movie seemed to struggle at giving each character a \"moment\" or keeping a consistent tone.\n\n-The \"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend\" musical number felt out of place? I initially thought from the trailers it was what Harley saw in her head as she beat up a bunch of thugs, but just having it randomly occur when Roman hits her felt out of place, especially since there was no callback to it. \n\n-Biggest pet peeve was how they handled Black Canary and her powers, which we already saw all of the moments she used them in the trailers. I get that we got a small hint at how Dinah's mom was the original Black Canary and she got her powers from her, but maybe a little exposition would've been nice? Why doesn't she ever use them? Why didn't any of the other characters say \"Wow, you have a sonic scream? Since when?\" She used it once and it never got mentioned again. \n\nOverall, it was a fun time at the movies.

The action was also pretty fucking awesome (as anyone would've guessed with one of the directors of John Wick). Humor is spotty and the plot is barebones and the child actress is kind of terrible which detracts heavily from the film and some of the cutting back and forth was frustrating instead of fun, but still, it was thoroughly enjoyable and I'd probably watch it again on Netflix or something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n7/10", "I think it sucks that today people are black and white \u201cyou love it\u201d or \u201cyou hate it\u201d. Because then there\u2019s no room for improvement. I loved the movie and concept but I believe they could\u2019ve made so many more improvements. I feel like I\u2019m coming into this from an outside perspective bc I haven\u2019t watched all the animated shows Harley Quin started in, I haven\u2019t read the comics, but I\u2019ve kinda done research since suicide squad and... honestly I believe Suicide Squad did Harley Quin better. Please don\u2019t come for me in pitch forks, but I say this all as constructive criticism. \n\nI know the movie is supposed to be told from Harley Quinn\u2019s perspective about the Birds of Prey but honestly it shouldn\u2019t have been. It should\u2019ve started with the Huntresses family being assassinated. It should\u2019ve been told linear pretty much. That\u2019s not even my biggest complaint. \n\nSo Harley Quinn is the Jokers counterpart. She was made literally for that. Anyways, she\u2019s a psychopath. She\u2019s a mastermind just as much as him. She\u2019s not helpless. She was pretty much his muscle for some time. Like she\u2019s not stupid. She could be very manipulative. And she enjoys playing mental gymnastics, which Suicide Squad displayed unlike Birds of Prey. On top of that. The movie shouldn\u2019t have focused around Harley Quin. It would\u2019ve been a better movie had it focused on the birds of Prey. The script. The fight scenes. It\u2019s a \u201csuper hero\u201d movie and it\u2019s almost unbelievable that these girls could do this much damage. The criticism is not black and white. Many people critique the fight scenes as not being realistic. \u201cHow are we supposed to make super hero movies look real\u201d you might ask. And honestly I don\u2019t have the answer. But marvel gets this right. Marvel gets the pacing, story telling, funny high moments, and sad impactful low moments. They could\u2019ve given Huntress more personality. Yes her storyline is pretty simple but it\u2019s possible to dig into that. I think they did Black Canery well, the best out of anybody in the movie. But it could\u2019ve been better. The cop, again, it could\u2019ve been better. The side comments about men and her promotion. I am an 18 year old female as it made me cringe. They could\u2019ve literally did everything they wanted without that. And back to Harley Quinn. They could\u2019ve had a few very emotional impactful scenes where Harley demonstrates just how badly she mourns for the Joker, how she\u2019s keeping up this front but at the end of the day she knows it was toxic and she needs to get over it. \n\nExample scenario: (Ignore what I said before about it being linear. Let\u2019s say they still went with their idea)\n\nBeginning of the movie it\u2019s not shown but mentioned how Harley and the Joker broke up. You see Harley Quinn in the club similar to Suicide Squad. Maybe she\u2019s a performer/ dancer similar to black Canery but a different club (not a stripper) (maybe that\u2019s how they know each other, same industry and stuff idk) Show some minor complication like how she broke that guys legs but just do that differently. I believe she should\u2019ve been more sexual. She almost uses her sexuality to her advantage. Maybe Margot Robbie didn\u2019t wana sexuality herself as much since I know she had a bigger hand in the production of this movie but still, that\u2019s Harley Quinn. In the animated shows she was sexual she was playful. I think the scene in Suicide Squad where the Joker calls Harley over and she toys with the guy Joker is talking too. The dynamic between Harley and the Joker and this guy is so chaotic I almost wana find a video to link it. I might come back and edit with links because I feel passionately about it. But she\u2019s sexual and chaotic for her own enjoyment of messing with that guys head, and she could\u2019ve easily have inflicted pain in a similar way in Birds of Prey, other than just physically onto the limo driver. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m articulating this right. I got off topic. \nScene: club, similar to Suicide Squad, inflicting both psychological pain and physical to the limo driver. They could\u2019ve also still kept how her pull from people believing she\u2019s still with the joker gives her immunity, but just this example alone I feel explains how they could\u2019ve done birds of prey better. I guess the script is to blame in this department? Because Margot Robbie is a fantastic actor and she really does embody Harley well, as well as the rest of the cast do well with their characters. But I don\u2019t know. \n\nSorry if this is a rant. If people interact with this I\u2019ll look for links to back up what I\u2019m saying because I have a particular scene in my head for everything I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m also not saying that should\u2019ve copied Suicide squad, but they should\u2019ve definitely ventured into what makes Harley Quinn a villain in the first place and maybe had a little more oversight into how the pacing and the story was told. Overall it\u2019s watchable and enjoyable and I liked it. I liked the little things they added like Harley Quinn on tightropes, fighting, in one of the backgrounds in the Funhouse fight scenes. It was a cute homage to her circus routes. I don\u2019t know much about Black Canery, Huntress, or the cop in Birds of Prey so feel free to correct or add information as needed. But this is my opinion and critique of the movie. I believe they did a good job. The soundtrack is also great. But the pacing, script, marketing, and other aspects of this movie should\u2019ve been different or explored and improved on. I\u2019m sorry the critique isn\u2019t black and white but that\u2019s how it is. I don\u2019t want to get political about things either but unfortunately I feel like this movie might\u2019ve slightly been. There was just a couple similar lines that ruined so many tones they were trying to set. I really wanted this movie to be award winning amazing, thought if for decades, kind of like Iron man is and always will be thought of as a great movie.

The portrayal of Montoya started to take me out of it at times, but it wasn't bad enough for me to write home about.\n\nOverall, my first impression of this movie was that it was \"Harley's Little Black Book: The Movie\" except one long story instead of several. I felt that Margot Robbie improved drastically in her role as Harley ever since Suicide Squad, and was elated to see Zsasz be portrayed so well. I felt that this was an above average comic book movie in the sense of being a comic book movie, but not as good at being a movie that has its inspiration drawn from comic books. I also felt that this movie was less \"in your face\" with having female leads and did a better job at incorporating them as characters, not female characters. (Now maybe I only feel that way because of my afore-mentioned love of comic books desensitizing me to some of the bluntness in this film, I know enough to know that that may be the case)\n\nTL;DR - I would reccomend it to my friends who love comic books, and probably advise all my other friends to watch something else", "Black Mask was killed because at the beginning of the final battle he didn't had the higher ground", "I knew Black Mask was fucked when he arrived and saw that Harley's crew had the high ground.", "[deleted]", "I didnt think it was terrible but it was a bit shallow, didn't get in deep enough with the characters.

It's a very gymnastic sort of place for a titty bar so it doesnt seem to fit and was it a previous haunt of the Joker? Why isnt he using it anymore but he cleaned it out and if they used to use it together why did Harley elect to go there? I didnt really care about missing the Joker or not knowing why they split until this scene. But now that i think of it, why wasnt he going to that club Harley likes anymore? Did he just decide those were Harley places and he'd  avoid them? The cop was the second? major character introduced and i never really got into her struggle, all the other characters just seemed to be pinging around. A lot of the editting is well suited to Harley's crazy but it doesnt really adapt to the other characyers and allow them to form their own connection to the audience. Its like whoever editted/directed this only really understood Harley and no one else. Even the villain is like a wannabee Joker, who's  mentality isnt a stretch from Harley. I would have loved to see some hint that Cass would be batwoman but shes a mini harley through and through.

The style and design of the movie were really well done, and the acting by the Birds and Ewen McGregor were great. The low stakes of the movie lended well to the more intimate characterization for Harley and made her a better character coming off of Suicide Squad.\n\nI didn't like the backtracking to give context to people and events, like the One Week Ago bit. I understand why they did it but it just seemed tedious to me. Maybe it's because I was totally on board for Harley's emancipation arc and going back to earlier events that already happened took me out of it.\n\nThe detective plot line I also didn't care for since it didn't seem like it impacted the story overall. All it did was get her fired so she could join the Birds for the climax.\n\nI loved Bruce and was so glad he lived.", "I have one question, does the bean bags were real or harley was imaginating that and shooting real rounds in the police station?

But we it felt off and not really like he could have run that kind of an operation. \n\nThe back and forth was off setting aswell, when you just got used to a sc\u00e8ne it got cut off again. Which can work, especially in a film as this, but it went to soon and too fast.\n\nThere were some fun bits, but I expected so much more.

My favorite scene is probably Harley storming the police station with the bean bag shotgun. It's exactly the kind of crazy fun shit you'd expect with the atmosphere this movie sets for itself.\n\nCharacter development was lacking. A lot of the humor fell flat IMO. Ewan Mcgregor, I love the guy just as much as anyone else, but his performance just felt cheesy in a weird way to me. I felt as if SOME of his scenes were pretty good, but others were just off.\n\nThe presence of \"feminism\" in this movie should really only be a bother if you're looking for something to be enraged about. Basically, if you're a \"no politics in my video games!!\" type. You know who you are.\n\nAt the end of the day, BoP has great action but kinda falls short elsewhere. It was worth the watch but I probably won't revisit it.", "Holy shit this was bad, I was not expecting something so messy, muddled, incoherent, disjointed, cringey and boring.

I'd probably rate this movie a 7 or 7.5 out of 10.", "I really enjoyed this but I felt like it still suffered from one of the major flaws of Suicide Squad: relying too heavily on music to provide characterization. It's not as egregious as Suicide Squad, but it was still happening. I think what Guardians gets right is that the music is tied to ::moments:: rather than character. The voiceover was only ok imo. It's very hard to do and i feel like every line of VO should try to be impactful/funny rather than just exposition. That said, I like the choppy storytelling, just thought the VO itself could've been punched up a bit.", "I loved it. It's an extremely funny movie, but not like they are telling jokes and one liners, more like the situations are funny, and it's a dark comedy. It's a pretty unique style of humor I thought.

The costume design was so good across the board.", "I really enjoyed this film.  Robbie and McGregor were great as Harley and Black Mask respectively.  I enjoyed the action and comedy.

I know she's a child actor, but I feel like they could have done better in her casting\n\n* No amount of suspension of disbelief can convince me that Rosie Perez can defeat a hired goon 3 times her size without using a gun\n\n* Black Canary's scream power had little explanation and only 1.5 uses throughout the entire film. As someone who reads the comics, I didn't feel like it was out of nowhere, but I don't know how people who don't know the character would react to it. I also wish she used it slightly more. \n\n* Took too long for the cast to all meet up together. The movie is at its best when all of them are together and unfortunately, there isn't much of that.\n\n* Too little Huntress.\n\n* Humour was more misses than hits\n\n* A plot hole: the guy that attacks Harley in her apartment just... leaves? He bombs it, then just forgets that he needs the child or the diamond. Maybe he was just a random person that wanted HQ dead, but they didn't explain it properly.

On one hand Perkins has a really great style: he knows how to work in creepy visuals and themes that feel organic to the story and characters. I thought Gretel was very well-developed and likeable; framing a horror story as sort of a twisted coming of age tale was an inspired choice, even if it was done far better in Robert Eggers' The Witch.\n\nI feel like with Os Perkins, the only thing holding him back from being a great filmmaker is his scripts. His films have such a slow pace to them, and that is normally what stops me from considering any of his films to be truly great. Both this and Blackcoat's Daughter I thought could have benefited from being short films. There are far too many scenes of this film where Gretel has creepy nightmare visions, only to wake up in bed. This happens at least 4-5 times, and although the visuals she encounters are creepy, the film can't help but feel monotonous as it chains itself to this structure. I wanted the script to develop and I wanted the characters to change, but they really didn't that much.\n\nThe opening act surprised me because it won me over quite soon. Gretel being forced out of the house she grew up in was a quick and effective way to garner sympathy for her. As a teenager who is struggling to live on their own as well, I found her initial struggle very captivating. Where the film starts to lose me is when Gretel and Hansel find the Witch's house, as this is where the story adopts the repetitive structure.\n\nIn the end, not a bad movie but not that great either. It had interesting themes of being forced into adulthood, and it had some creepy visuals that I'll probably be seeing in my dreams tonight. But the film could have been more and it could have committed itself more to being a character piece. I just couldn't help but think of Robert Eggers and his two films: The Witch and The Lighthouse. Both of which are far superior to this unfortunately. \n\nThe Witch is creepier while having a similar subject matter of a young girl discovering and accepting who she is. And The Lighthouse had a similar style of the whole movie being just two characters interacting, much like Gretel and the Witch interact in this movie, except The Lighthouse truly felt like it was getting crazier and crazier as the film goes on. It had a narrative thrust that this film lacked. One day Os Perkins will make a masterpiece. He just needs to find a script that properly develops, and one that fits his subtle, odd style.", "I kinda dug it. Definitely relies heavily on its atmosphere and production design, since its kind of basic otherwise, but I liked the weirdness of it. For a mainstream horror film it\u2019s far above stuff like The Grudge imo.", "This movie's edge was completely dulled every time the voiceover cut in. I think that was the movie's problem in general. It couldn't decide if it wanted to be super dark and disturbing or whether it wanted to play it safe and go more fairytale.

I kept getting vibes of both The Witch and the Tom Cruise movie Legend.", "Well it's probably the least commercial film I've seen get a 3,000+ theater release so it has that going for it.

Other than the witch eating bacon left on the table by Gretel at the end, we never once see her eating any of the children-turned-food or gorging excessively, as I imagine she would do.!<\n\n\nAlso, plot hole I noticed with Gretel: >!in the beginning of the film she tells that creepy man she can't read or write, yet she's able to read the witch's cookbook at make a sleeping potion? Alrighty.!<", "What a strange film to discuss. The sets, the visuals, the camerawork, the music? All A+. What an absolutely gorgeous and stylish movie. It oozed atmosphere, used surreal and strange choices to really bring the fairy tale elements to the forefront, and really drew me into the world quickly.\n\nIt's a real shame about the actual script though. I suppose the acting as well, but the script is the real stinker of the overall production. It had some real momentum in the beginning, with the characters moving forward well, the horror and terror really permeating the film, and I really felt for Gretel and Hansel.\n\nThe problems really started once they reached the Witch's house. While truly creepy and genuinely gorgeous to look at, the film got itself into a really awful groove of \"something creepy happens, Gretel goes to bed, has a horrifying nightmare that may or may not have happened, and then wakes up\". Then the movie would fill in the waking hours with some random shit that often didn't matter, and then we'd go right back to the dreams. It left the film feeling like it didn't really have an end in sight, and even worse, left the movie feeling like nothing was actually happening.\n\nI had a glimmer of hope with the hidden doorknob, but then even that got turned into a surreal \"dream but awake\" sequence that still failed to really go anywhere. The movie sticking so strictly to the Hansel & Gretel fairy tale dragged the story down a lot too, as the \"oven\" and burning the Witch just felt really dull and uninteresting by the end, as all the dream stuff just kinda vomited into place by the end.\n\nFor all the actually cool worldbuilding that happened at the start, with the Enchantress (oh my god what a sick visual), the girl with the pink dress, the 'vampire', the woodsmen, and even the mention of the \"Wolves\", not a single bit of it felt even remotely paid off. My biggest disappointment is that the Enchantress never really factored into the story either. It showed up in one of Gretel's dreams and then... nothing? What a real shame.\n\nThat ending narration was also truly awful, likely a studio addition, cuz that ending itself was a real stinker too and needed the explanation, but it was more a sign of a bad ending than it was a sign it needed someone explaining it to us.\n\nAll in all, this was a movie where everything pointed to this movie being a brilliant film, if only the script hadn't been a complete empty mess. I'm definitely going to be listening to the music from this movie if I can, it was wonderful. But I can't really recommend this unless you're willing to just watch the randomness on screen and take in how gorgeous it all looks. I for one just couldn't get over how little plot this really had.\n\n4/10.", "Saw this movie last night.\n\nIn my opinion it's one of the best examples of style over substance I've seen in recent years. It looked beautiful and was well framed, but after the aesthetic qualities wore off it quickly became boring. \n\nNothing much at all really happens? Especially when the children reach the witches house. The music even becomes bland and vaguely annoying after a while and it just degenerates into a slightly smug art house horror, without any real feeling of tension or peril. The finale just 'happens' as well and is done and dusted in 5 mins. It's like the writer just wanted at the very end to get it all over with.\n\nWhich is fine I guess, as I felt the exact same by this point.", "Hansel's dialogue was so overwritten. No little kid talks like that.", "wife had to nudge me a few times to stop from snoring. Do not recommend watching after a breakfast buffet with complementary momosas.  Don't want to be mean but it was a very slow burn movie.", "This movie could have been really terrible but much to my surprise it ended up being just not very good. I had pretty low hopes as it's been a while since I've seen a good dark fairytale and it's just hard to get excited about January studio dumps. Luckily the visual aspects of this movie kept me interested for the relatively short runtime.\n\nNothing in this movie is really terrible. It's dark, the acting is solid even from the little kid and especially from Sophia who looked right at home in a movie that rests on her shoulders, it's very deliberate, you could tell someone really cared to make this better than it could have been and that was nice. The aspect that really stands out is obviously the visuals. Every shot looked good and it was visually interesting enough I never got bored or hated the movie for being bad. \n\nThe writing was probably the worst thing about it probably just because it's kind of tedious to tell us a story we already know even if the details are changed. Even when they are showing us things about this story we don't know it's less interesting because we know where it does go. There's no guessing, we know the witch is evil, we know Gretel will eventually kill her. I found the twist about the witch actually being the kid in the tale's mother almost completely pointless because it didn't change anything about what was happening currently or who the bad guy is. I'm not even sure I totally understood that revelation.\n\nYou can see The VVITCH all over this thing. Not necessarily a bad thing, I think the best thing a movie can do to solidify itself as a classic is influence other films. It's in the story, in the score, in the visuals, even in the actual dialogue. None of this is a bad thing if you can make it your own, but what made The VVITCH so great was that it really gave into its own themes. It wasn't about a girl who kills a witch, it's about a girl who becomes one. And not a humanitarian nature witch, a straight up grind up your babies to make youth juice witch. \n\nThis movie wussed out on the ending in that sense. I was actually pretty intrigued with the stretch in the movie where Gretel was super into being a bad bitch and tried to push Hansel into the forest. But once she found out where the food came from she was out the game, there was no dilemma. Would have loved an ending that at least convinced me for a moment she thought about killing Hansel. Alas...\n\n5/10. This movie is totally fine. If you're interested, see it. It's more worth a watch than I would have guessed, but it's just not enough to make it any good.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "What rolled out of Hansel\u2019s bag at the end of the movie (that he threw on the table)? Magic beans??", "I saw a couple mice running up and down the stairs and scurrying around the floor of my theater just before this movie started. They scared me and held my attention much more than this movie. Whenever I'd get bored (which was a lot) I'd just look off in the distance to search for the next mouse to take his turn on perimeter duty.", "Overall I liked the movie, but there were quite a few questions that were never addressed, let alone answered:\n\n- Why would the witch want to give Gretel powers?\n- Why did the witch have Hansel sharpen the saw only to never see it or bring it up again?\n- What happened to the witch\u2019s daughter (the girl in the pink cap)? She mentioned eating her children, but I don\u2019t believe that included her?\n\nThere was also the scene with the monster/huntsman at the beginning where we never really figured out if he was a good guy or was part of the witch\u2019s plan too, although the latter seems to be the more likely option. \n\nIt seemed like the kind of movie that really could have benefited from an extra 10 minutes or so to iron out some of the details.", "It was meh. The actor who played Hansel was terrible. Gretel actress was decent but didn't capture me. The Witch was the best by far in the acting realm. Dialogue was awful. They should've had everyone speak in old English, like what Eggers did in *The Witch*. I just kept hearing some American teenage kids voices. And it wasn't scary. The cinematography was very well done though. Visually very dark and intriguing. Overall, would give a 3/10. It's a shame b/c this story could make an incredible horror film if done right. I hope Eggers decides to do a version of it in coming years.", "Very average, especially considering Oz Perkins previous work.", "I didn\u2019t like the movie, but I also didn\u2019t hate it. Very middle-of-the-road IMO. Most interesting character was definitely the witch, but the titular characters sort of fell flat for me. All in all not the worst January movie I\u2019ve ever seen, that\u2019s for sure.", "Such a weird movie. Phenomenal cinematography and special effects combined with a horrible script (story, dialogue, pacing... all bad) and horrible acting.\n\nIt somehow combines a high-class prestigious art movie with crappy shlock and ends up just being boring for the most part.\n\nIncredibly strange. 3/10", "I enjoyed the movie. It was slow but the dialogue kept me intrigued. I like the scenery and the witches house. The only thing I didnt like was how easy it was for Gretel to kill the witch. Unless the witch let her? As in the witch felt like she taught Gretel enough and wanted to leave the woods to her? Also how annoying the younger witch was with her generic and uninspired tattoos. Other than those 2 things, I liked the movie. I probably wouldnt see it in theaters again but I'm not disappointed that I did.", "This movie was fucking awful! It's like some arthouse student saw The Witch and the Suspiria remake and wanted to replicate the same style and failed miserably. I don't mind slow paced movies, but it felt like there was just nothing of importance happening until the last 15 minutes or so. Aside from the woman who played the Witch the acting was not good and the femenist themes felt incredibly hamfistted. Also it was very obvious the narration was an after thought in post production. And what was up the with the 80's synth score in random parts? Overall just a terrible film.", "I know I'm in the minority but I LOVED it. A lot. It reminded me a lot of a Panos Cosmatos film mixed with Blair Witch Project and The Witch. I was shocked how much I enjoyed it. I definitely understand why people wouldn't though.", "I enjoyed the movie, the visual aspect is amazing, I really like that they made the witches\u2019 clothes and the witchhouse have a more modern vibe, which seemed wildly out of place at first but then it made sense because they\u2019re supposed to be weird in-universe.\n\nReally didn\u2019t dig the narration and I felt the ending was kinda anti-climatic? The old witch was defeated too easily? I kinda hope they\u2019d show more of the girl learning magic and get more corrupted so there would be more conflict and more dramatic at the end.\n\nI felt like it has elements of visual from The Neon Demon and a similar story/vibe to The Witch with a fairy-tale like atmosphere... overall enjoyable movie.\n\nThe font was kinda wack tho", "I wasn't very thrilled.\n\nThe first half hour or so had some interesting shots. Art-house vibes, different than your average horror movie.. Then it started to drag a bit which is concerning, considering it's super short (sub 90 minutes). The end was more in-line with your typical horror film. Interesting take on Hansel & Gretel, but not very exciting. Felt like I missed a few lines of dialogue.. not sure if it was poor sound mixing or I'm becoming hard of hearing. I did do speaker work behind the screen recently and blasted my ears with a terrible test tone at short range. :P\n\nI'd say 5/10. I was quite bored.", "What", "the vvitch ran so gretel & hansel could walk (honestly I enjoyed it quite a bit so this isn\u2019t really meant to be taken negatively)", "Watched it and enjoyed it.

Acting was meh, sound design was decent, cinematography was good but not outstanding. This movie could have been so much better if it had a more suspenseful/thrilling story backed by an R rating.

It needed more meat on the bones.

The result is a half-measure that, to me, failed to land.\n\nAn A24 horror film is patient, atmospheric, often esoteric. They're nothing like the pop-culture/main-stream sort of horror movies, that rely on quips and jump scares and simplistic supernatural elements. A24 films create a *feeling* of dread and rely on a palpable, unshakable mood to keep the audience unsettled. pop-horror movies---after you've seen them a time or two and know where all the \"scary moments\" are---tend to become tedious and boring. You realize that there have long stretches of nothing in between fleeting \"moments\" (literally) of scares.\n\nReally, they're not even \"scares;\" they're \"surprises.\"\n\nA24 movies (and again, I know this makes me sound super pretentious and I don't mean to be) often, in my experience, are able to be revisited time and again, with that same foreboding and unsettling feeling coming back every time you watch. When you watch The Conjuring (a very well-made pop-horror film) enough times, you know when every scary moment is going to happen, so you're not scared anymore. Can it really be called a horror film at that point? If you're not scared what are you even watching the movie for? You're not watching it; you're just sitting through it.\n\nBut I can watch Hereditary for the umpteenth time and still walk away with a mildly upset stomach.\n\nGretel and Hansel wants to be an A24-sort of horror movie. It has long, slow takes, a lot of slightly unnatural, almost dreamlike, dialogue, bizarre imagery with little explanation, and a moody atmosphere. Where it stumbles is in a failure to fully embrace those ideas. It's made with a lot of confidence but I wonder if producer notes didn't interfere with Osgood Perkins' vision for the movie. \n\nThe narration, the zombie action scene in the beginning, and the pat ending all felt out of place, as if a producer said \"the audience won't know what's going on\" and \"it's too boring in act one\" and \"it needs a happy ending.\"\n\nI think I would have liked it more had it kept things vague, embraced the atmosphere from the jump, and gone for a darker ending.  \n\nHonestly, and this is going to sound really pretentious, but \"if this was a real A24 film,\" Gretel would have eaten her brother and become the new evil Witch in the house. But I guess that kind of ending is down downer for something that's trying to win over a pop-audience. \n\nThere is a lot to like about the movie, particularly with the visuals and the actors. The film is beautifully photographed and all all three actors are great as well, with Alice Krige in particular being captivating as the Witch. She was never overtly menacing, never raised her voice...but she was still constantly unsettling and nerve-wracking.\n\nThe movie feels like a missed opportunity. It was so close to becoming a cult favorite, had it only been a little more daring. Instead, I think the people in charge got cold feet and watered the film down in the hopes of creating a mainstream, pop-horror hit. Instead, the movie will be forgotten in a month and rarely commented on again. \n\nIts greatest sin is that it's only okay, when it could have been so much more.", "Like what most people are saying, it does pull a lot of similarities from the VVitch but I still enjoyed the storytelling and how they brought classic witch themes in a different light. Also it was shot very well. I'm actually kinda torn between if I like this more or less than the VVitch but I'd def recommend to a horror fan", "This movie is so unyieldingly shitty, I feel like I become hysterical when I think or talk about how bad it is. I don\u2019t know how anyone could defend this movie. I feel so wronged by this film that I turn into an angry and aggressive person when I think about it. I\u2019m never going into a movie again without checking IMDb first. My girlfriend\u2019s jaw dropped multiple times during the movie because she was so amazed at the awful dialogue. I wasn\u2019t like this in the beginning; I used to be kind and tolerant. Gretel and Hansel has turned me into a distrusting scrounge when it comes to movies. Also, why turn a fairy tale villain into a tattooed Gothic chick that looks like she has a successful onlyfans? This is, by the way, one of the more innocent offenses in this godforsaken trash movie.", "It seemed like a poor man's version of The VVitch. The feminist angle they tried shoehorning into the story just did not work. The lead of a female in a film like the vvitch was done so perfectly, but in this the witch in gretel and hansel is trying to let the young actress know men cant stand strong women and will hate them.", "Can finally stop seeing its crap trailer before movies I actually want to see yay!", "Yea, this movie kinda sucked. Not The Turning level bad, but still bad.\n\nPacing sucked. Movie was moving wayyyy too slow at times.

I get what they were trying to go for with the camera but it felt distracting while watching. \n\nLast 20 minutes or so were thrilling I guess. Good cinematography. Acting performances were fine. But aside from that didn\u2019t enjoy much else. \n\nOnly a 3/10 from me", "The movie was ok. Not good. Not bad.

I haven't seen any other Oz Perkins movies or The Witch, so I don't have those as points of reference, but it's amazing to me that this got a wide release given the pacing and complete lack of popular horror elements.  \n\n\nRather than complain about \"the feminism\" being shoehorned into this, surely that seems like the entire point?  The story reminded me of cultures I learned about in anthropology where women pass their secret knowledge down from generation to generation.  Presented with a world that told her that women are for pleasure, support, and/or parenting, Gretel learns about a different way -- a way to be independent.  Rather than accepting the witch's dogma that she has to sever all ties to her past and actively reject those traditional roles, she finds a way to preserve those ties while still allowing herself her independence.  \n\n\nAgreed that the voiceovers were a bit daft, but considering there are people that think that >!her hands turning black at the end means that she's become the new incarnation of evil!<, they apparently needed to be even more overt.", "It\u2019s movies like this that make me realize what a shit show this sub is.

She's a teacher with a dark past, cool. We never get any real motivation for her though. Miles menaced Kate with \"I know what you're afraid of\" but like, I STILL don't actually know what she was afraid of. Was it spiders? Drowning? The dark? Abandonment? Her potential for mental illness?  The early pool scene and her alluding to some kind of trauma in her talk with Miles made me think she had some hydrophobia that would be addressed, but that went nowhere. It seems like >!\"she's broken just like you!\"< Was supposed to be some kind of wham line about her sanity but we got zero foreshadowing that that was Kate's insecurity. Kate supposedly connects with the kids because she lost her parents too, but the kids barely even mention their parents and seem more connected with the >!previous caretakers/ghosts!<\n\nI didn't get the kids' motivations either. We're they loyal to the ghosts more, or each other? We're they being manipulated or doing the manipulation? Did they want Kate to stay or not?

All I know is that the special effects were laughable and my favorite part of seeing the movie in theaters was the preview for Antebellum.", "In the first 5 minutes where she says she wants to make a difference.. wait what 1 kid > 30. I knew I was in for a ride", "Why are so many saying the ending is super bad? Even with my regal pass I\u2019m not sure if I can be bothered to watch this, but I\u2019m curious about this abrupt non ending I keep hearing about", "Was the shot in the trailer of the little girl having the spooky ghost running her fingers through her hair cut, or did I miss it?", "I have a high tolerance for shitty movies and I didn't expect too much from this but it still manage to be worse than I expected.\n\nThe \"ending\" felt like the made a few different ones to try out with test audiences then when they put the final edit together they forgot to remove two of them.", "I work for a movie theatre, thus I got to see this movie for free, yet I still feel like I was robbed. The first minutes were pretty good, they set up a lot of really good elements. I thought the entire time that there was some sort of curse on the family if they left the property. They said the parents died in a car accident right outside the property, one of the pictures on the wall was of an ancestor dying while sailing, the great grandmothers mannequin, and Florals freakout seemed like obvious set ups for that plotline, kind of makes me feel like this was the original goal but script edits ruined it. \n\nI don't see where they were going with the mental health angle, the mom obviously had issues but they never followed up on them besides that one throwaway line about genetics, if the ending was supposed to imply that she was becoming her mother, I honestly would've preferred them to just show the nanny looking at herself in the mental asylum. This whole ending just felt like a poor attempt to add depth to a B level horror flick at best, I wish they would've just went all ghouly ghosts with it because the added layers were trash.", "I want to know why the little girl couldn't leave the property? \n\nI assumed the ending was her seeing herself.\n\nThe movie was not the best, the supernatural element was done very poorly. The ghost scenes kind of reminded me of Hugh Kane from Scary Movie 2. \n\nWere the kids terrorizing the nanny/tutor or was she terrorizing them? Why all the surrounding plots, like the parents being killed or the nanny/tutor's mom being crazy, if they weren't going to have anything to do with the story line. And what did Kurt Cobain have to do with the story? I get that they were trying to date the time period but the 1 poster on the boy's wall was Kurt Cobain wasn't it?? And he clearly liked playing rock music but there was no link. Am I the crazy one here? Did anyone else have these same questions?", "I don't get the ending", "I always get so bummed out when I think a movie looks good and then the reviews start rolling in and it\u2019s clearly a piece of shit.", "I was enjoying the first 50 minutes, then got bored.

It was so hopelessly boring that I could feel the seconds ticking away on my life.", "I'm late to the game here and no one will probably see this but this movie pissed me off so badly I had to rant to SOMEONE and my while family is currently sleeping. One of my biggest pet peeves is pick your own ending books; to me it's lazy and fickle and makes me think that you have no sense of creativity to play out an original storyline.  This is the movie version of that.  It's not poignant or reflective; they couldn't pick an ending because they had a disconnected plot so they just have a bunch of endings so everyone else could do the thinking for them. Anything I may have liked throughout the movie was totally negated by that garbage-fire ending.", "Oh boy, just got back from the theaters. Much to unpack. \n\nI feel like somewhere in this movie, there was a decent movie. Heck, I'd even say for the first half of this movie, it was a solid B psychological horror film. Definitely something I could play in the background or get lost in this gothic fantasy world of large mansions, horseback riding and maze grounds. \n\nBecause I will give Floria Sigismondi and the set production + cinematography credit, this is a beautifully shot movie with very gorgeous gothic imagery despite the forced jump scares.\n\nAll the actors in my opinion, did what was required of them and tried to elevate the material. Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard and Brooklynn Prince all played off each other very well. Barbara Marten was also fantastic. They carried this movie and deserved better. \n\nIt's a shame the script wasn't written by someone more skilled and nuanced, because they could have explored so much more of the ghosts and the children's suggested trauma. Miles' relationship with Quint and Quint's influence/corruption on Miles. Flora's trauma of not wanting to leave the grounds. So much was set up and teased, but never fully explored.\n\nThen there's Kate's trauma of neglect and abandonment issues, possible mental abuse from her mother that's all there in the subtext. \n\nThe ending though. THAT ENDING. I definitely see why people hate it. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It makes me think there was an alternate cut and they went with this route, which may have been the \"safe\" route in the studios' mind, but instead, it effectively threw everything out. The original novella hints at a lot of the dark stuff the kids may or may not have witnessed and this movie seemed like it was going in that direction until the last 10 minutes.", "Sixth Sense: I see dead people\n\n\nThe Turning: I imagine dead people", "I\u2019ll give props to the cast for their acting, but the dialogue could\u2019ve been better, and the ending...this film had the potential to be good or even better but sadly it failed, and don\u2019t get me started on that ending...if there even was a real ending.", "The only thing I know for sure about this movie is that it had an ending. The credits rolled and the movie was over. That's all I know for sure. Why they chose to end the movie there or what they were trying to do with that ending is an open question.

Boring, dull, jump scares don't hit.  The characters are awful and Finn's character in particular is awful everytime he appears you just want him gone.  The ending was abrupt like people are saying.  Some good scenes start happening like the pool scene and the horse chase through the maze.  But the ending of any good scenes just have something that piss you off.    \n\n\nAvoid this movie.", "Ummm excuse me, what the fuck was that ending?", "Can someone explain to me how the daughter supposedly saw the parents car accident?

It\u2019s not even that it was a bad ending, because that would imply there was a conclusion to be made. \n\nThat being said I was really enjoying the movie, it was visually appealing and acted well (for the genre). I did wish they leaned on the 90s aesthetic more with more loud grunge music. Why even mention Kurt Cobain  if Nirvana isn\u2019t played in the movie?", "So I'm trying to figure out the significance of the \"Take off your shoes/no shoes\" sign at the place she visited her mom, they clearly zoomed in on her shoes to show she didn't read or ignored the sign.\n\nAlso if Kate was actually crazy then what was the first sequence where the nanny before her was trying to escape? Was that part of her hallucination too? If so they didn't make it clear to the audience. \n\nOverall I thought the build up and acting was solid but it seemed as if they just didn't want to film more scenes to have a proper ending and they just dropped it. \n\n5/10", "My interpretation of the ending(an interpretation I haven't really seen anywhere) is that the tree we kept seeing with multiple leafless branches was a metaphor for the ending. There are three endings and I feel it implies that she's doomed to relive her experience in the house over and over in her nightmares following branching story lines but all ending hopelessly.  \nMy girlfriend said it's a loop and she becomes her mom, so when she looked her mom in the face during the true ending she saw herself and realized she's insane. So she'll end up becoming her mother and watch it happen to her daughter. But I think that's stupid. I think she saw the old nanny that was murdered.", "I hear everyone talking about this ending but obviously I'm not gonna watching this pos movie so can someone tell me why and what everyone is freaking out about the ending", "I think that because there were small scenes where it has nothing to do with Kate, like the beginning where Quint is attacking Mrs. Jessel or when the mannequin head moves, it could be implied that it really is haunted? \n\nthis movie was just a mess, like I get that it wanted to be like left up to the audience to decide but this movie just didn\u2019t like deserve to be so vague.", "The thing that pissed me off? I\u2019m pretty sure the CD that Kate gave Miles was Hole\u2019s \u201cLive Through This\u201d which came out one week after Kurt Cobain died.

YES, THAT WAS MY BIG PROBLEM WITH IT (on top of all of the other problems.)", "ngl in the beginning, i was one hundred percent sure miles was being sexually assaulted by quint (quint was getting him drunk and miles kept quints clothing which was very questionable to me) which--on top of quint's death and the assault and murder of jessel (that maybe he'd witnessed??)--was causing miles to lash out and behave inappropriately towards kate. \n\n\ni also thought kate had been assaulted in her childhood which to me explained miles' certainty when he told kate (paraphrasing) \"he knew what she was afraid of\" and that \"leaving the lights on wouldn't save her.\" i thought the crux of the story would be survivors finding community and summoning strength within themselves to not let their trauma define them (via a boss battle where miles dispels quint's influence from himself--i thought that was where the spider thing was gonna come in bUt It dIdNt EvEn ShOw Up In ThE mOvIe :////--and kate releases jessel)\n\n\n i mean im probably just projecting but there's no way im the only one who thought that was where it was going right?", "This is easily one of the messiest movies I\u2019ve ever seen. The first half of the movie sets up a story that never comes into fruition and is instead replaced with a boring storyline featuring a spoooooky ghost that has the quality of one of the ghosts in the haunted mansion and another ghost whose power is to summon electric guitar riffs when walking. The children become irrelevant in the last quarter of the movie which was a shame because they were actually decent actors. \n\nOh yeah and a shitty ending that was a painfully bad attempt at leaving it up to the viewers interpretation.

In December 2017, it was announced that Finn Wolfhard was cast as one of the orphans. In January 2018, Brooklynn Prince joined the cast. In February 2018, the rest of the cast was announced as principal production commenced. The casting of Joely Richardson was announced in **January 2019**.\n\nKate's mother was cast in January.

This and Uncut Gems Booth has a similar viewing experience, except instead of dead and stress, I was feeling joy and excitement, but neither felt like I could really recline and rest the whole way through.\n\nLots of nods and winks to other movies, which I attribute to Fletcher\u2019s description of everything being through a cinematic lens.\n\nAlso I just want to say I love the plaid track suits and am considering researching them for my personal procurement down the line.", "Was finally able to see the movie tonight. Thought it was really good. It\u2019s a shame this probably won\u2019t make enough money to be considered a success. I really like Guy Ritchie\u2019s movies and I feel like he is a really talented director. I really feel like this movie and Man From Uncle deserve sequels but they will probably never get them. Why does no one watch these movies?", "Just when you thought Hollywood was all Marvel sequels and Disney remakes you get something refreshing. Between this, The Lighthouse, Knives Out, and Midsommar I feel thoroughly spoiled", "This movie made me want to dress like a British gentleman", "love seeing Guy Ritchie going back to his roots.  \nCast was stacked and everyone still delivered.  \nBest movie i've seen in quarantine with invisible man being a close 2nd", "I don\u2019t know what else to say but I loved every part of it. One of my favorite in recent times, so funny, so enjoyable and the OUTFITS?! My god I\u2019ll have inspiration for outfits for years to come. Very surprised at how good this was. Everyone In the movie was so good. I hope this starts to draw more audiences with good word of mouth.", "Favorite movie of the year!\n\nJokes aside, I really did love this film. Reminds me of a mixture of Knives Out and Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels but leaves you with a great mystery with an action angle. Loved that Grant was a cinefile and framed the story to make it more action oriented. While the score was sorta kinda generic I don't think it subtracts any points off the film. Along with the snappy edits made this film fly by and how they set it up for a possible but not nessisarily needed sequel feel more welcomed and not groan inducing\n\n It even didn't bother me that Matthew McConaughey used British slang, which normally would because people who tend to be fluent in the language and move to a different area tend to adapt the accent from time to time, while retaining his accent because he grown accustomed to the culture. \n\nThis film also made me realize and come to accept that Colin Ferrell is one of my favorite actors after years of saying \"I love this film\" and sure enough he's in it with 7 Psychopaths and In Bruges being stand outs with the Lobster being a more subtle example of how excellent he is with delivery and mannerisms with a character.\n\nOverall a personal 10/10", "Just watched it. Pretty fuckin good imo. I might rewatch this weekend which is something i rarely do", "I'm obviously really late to this movie, but I finally got to see it and I enjoyed it a lot. Hugh Grant was fucking phenomenal, every second he was on screen was great. There was some amazing dialogue and really great acting all around. It wasn't amazing, but I thought it was very enjoyable and would easily recommend it.", "Wow, what a great movie. I was a little wary in the beginning but at the first quarter mark it really picks up steam and delivers. The humor is also fantastic, had me in stitches with the trunk scene.", "I'd put it below Rocknrolla, Snatch and Lock Stock, but it's a welcome return to form for Ritchie after King Arthur and Aladdin. Though it doesn't quite have the narrative depth or same amount of colorful characters as Rocknrolla. Probably my biggest complaint about the movie, is that I never really felt that the main characters or their organization were ever in any real trouble. It felt like they just had the situation under control and were always a hundred steps ahead of their rivals at every turn. What I appreciated about Rocknrolla, is that there's a real sense of uncertainty and flux within each of the gangs/criminal factions as the plot progresses and they all try to come out on top over each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparatively, i didn't really feel like there was much in the way of real consequence for anything that happened in The Gentleman and that diminished the journey a bit on my end.  On the positive end, Collin Farrell and Hugh grant essentially dominated every scene they were in and their characters were easily the highlights of the movie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me the Gentleman would get a solid 7-7.5/10. It does its job well enough, but could have been stronger in some areas. Ritchie has yet to top Snatch & Rocknrolla for me.", "Asian guy here, just wanted to throw this psa out there: it\u2019s okay to laugh at Asian jokes, just like I laugh at jokes about other races as long as there\u2019s no real hatred behind it.

And the Arsenal cameo \ud83d\ude04\n\nThough I do think then painting Mat as the \"good guy\" was abit too much. He was still a criminal who was shown to have killed people. He really wasn't an anti hero like they wanted to show him as.\n\nAlso they should have kept Goulding around abit longer. His random \"Imma gonna rape you now\" death was such an odd turn for a charecter they built up as a serious threat", "I saw this film early this month when it released in the UK, not sure why it's only releasing widely now but I hope it doesn't hurt its reception. It's a really fun film of Guy Ritchie at his best, lightning fast pace with never ending witty dialogue and constant back and forth that keeps you guessing, it can often get confusing seeing multiple characters across different times but in the end it all gets tied up nicely. It's a cool story of the \"new\" wannabe gangster thugs going up against the \"old\" organised criminals with class and connections, or \"The Gentlemen\".", "Does anyone know how the coach\u2019s boys knew the Germans were after mick at the end?

I think everyone acted well, aside from Henry Golding, who seemed miscast to me. Also, the movie leaves room for a sequel, which we all know we\u2019ll never get.", " All those heroic saves, yet Coach and his boys felt underappreciated, at least that's what the movie implies.. I mean seriously dude, without Coach and his boys Mickey is pretty much gone. He didn't get his weed back, he would lose Ray, and in the end he'd be dead by the Russian. Raymond is nothing compared to his deeds. Mickey could've given him the 20mils that Fletcher asked for.", "Yes it's very reminiscent of Ritchie's other work, however I think the big thing holding The Gentlemen back is the lack of a good antagonist. Hatchet Harry, Brick Top, and Uri (the Russian from RocknRolla) were all to be feared. We were told they were to be feared. Then we were shown just how terrifying they could be. They said, did, and for the most part got away with some of their horrible plans. The Gentlemen doesn't have this. Is Henry Golding the bad guy? He doesn't really achieve much. Is Hugh Grant the bad guy? He is playing people against each other, but he's not intimidating at all, and none of the characters seem worried about him. Lastly, is it Jeremy Strong? Sure he has a plan that seems to be working initially, until we find out that he wasn't really in control at all and McConaughey and Hunnam were always one step ahead.", "Cumberland Gap is the dopest song.", "I don't understand why bosses keep going to meeting without a gun squad guarding him.

If you\u2019re a fan of Guy\u2019s previous work I\u2019d say it\u2019s a safe bet you\u2019ll enjoy this one. Charlie Hunnam is the best I\u2019ve ever seen him, Colin Farrell murders his comedic timing, and although there may have been about 10-15 minutes to trim off this movie, I still greatly enjoyed myself.

I've only ever been there twice but no doubt whenever the story takes you to Tokyo, it always feels like a love letter to the place. The art in WWY/TnK was fantastic, though there was a lot more obvious use of CGI this time around (Goshintai shots in Your Name would have been CGI, and there was plenty of CGI Tokyo skyline shots here). \n\nStory-wise, it never gets to the same kinds of highs as Your Name, but as a movie on its own, I thought it was still good. My main gripe was the main character's decision in the end. I know *why* he did it, and that he *is* a teenager at the end of the day, but it was still frustrating. That said, the fact that the ending frustrates me is also what made me like the movie more - the main character remained flawed to the end. There was character growth, but it wasn't a stereotypical resolution. It wasn't exactly a happy ending.\n\nThe audience gasped at the Your Name cameos, though I had a couple of friends who didn't know what was going on as they hadn't watched Your Name before that (this was remedied pretty quickly since it's on Netflix Australia, LOL). \n\nThe next Shinkai movie won't have to bear the weight of being \"The next Shinkai movie after Your Name\", and it would be even better for it.", "I fucking loved how much more mature this movie was, as compared to Your Name. I dunno, this hit me a lot harder simply because of the adult characters and much more adult themes of finding your way in a world that demands you provide for the ones you love. \n\nThe commentary on this \"new\" economy was not lost on me. The amount of images of commercialism (all the advertisement, product placement. All the discussion of part time jobs, what people have to do to survive). That, on top of the aspect of love and being a provider. Just hit me so much harder than just a standard \"star-crossed lovers\" story. \n\nI also felt like both characters were a little bit more fleshed out.\n\nEdit: after posting my comments, and reading some of the ones below, I'm a little shocked, but also content, with the fact I may be in the minority on this one. I appreciate how others could see this as a relative \"Your Name\" redux, but I truly do believe that the thematic elements resonated with me a bit more, and that because it was willing to grapple with elements like adulthood, sex work, gun violence and the repercussions of allowing Japan to continue to drown, it ended with a much more bold and thought-provoking film.", "Local Thirsty Boy Causes Global Warming. \n\nIn all seriousness I loved this movie.

We have to focus on the drama of law enforcement hot on the trail of unaccompanied minors, and yet we get maybe five minutes in the visually amazing 'cloud world.'

This is much more of a teen movie than YN, but it\u2019s anchored by its enviro-mysticism (and its actual environmentalist theme). A lot of Shinkai\u2019s signature navel gazing, but like YN he\u2019s managed to find a good balance between that and the story in a way that brings it all together. Also like YN: very funny. Supporting cast (including da kitty) brought it to life.

So if you are not a fan of romantic movies this movie is probably not going to be for you. While I know alot of people are not going to like the main character's choice at the end Let me give you something else to think about and the lesson/theme Mokoto Shinkai was trying to get across and is something I Feel alot of people don't learn and that is \"Its ok to be selfish sometimes\"\n\nThe World Turned their back on our main characters and they did everything they could to try and make it.

So in the end it was ok for her to be selfish for this one moment for her love for the male lead.\n\nAt least this is how i see it and as an older audience member I could relate to this lesson. In Small amounts being selfish isn't a bad thing. That is just my analysis anyways;\n\nAnimations:Of course Shinkai is great nothing needs to be said here as always this is top notch. Also keep an eye out and you might see some familiar faces!!\n\nFinal Grade: I am giving this an 8.5/10 I honestly think we are seeing a Modern Day Miyazaki in front of us and while I think alot of people will hate my last statement as people have shrines of Miyazaki and say nothing will ever come close to his achievements and life works. I think Shinkai is getting there.", "Thought it was just fine, especially compared to the transcendental greatness of Your Name. I don't think the intent was to say \"we can't fix climate change and that's fine, cause we have love and everyone will be happy\" but it sure felt that way. Didn't feel grounded enough.\n\n[Alison Willmore's review reframed my perspective of the setting. The animation is so beautiful and the dialogue so whimsy you forget just how fucked up it is that the main characters are parentless teenagers who deal with guns and prostitution!](https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/weathering-with-you-movie-review-makoto-shinkais-new-anime.html)", "I saw it yesterday and I loved it. I never expected it to be as great as Your Name (it shouldn't be compared to other movies in the first place, especially not to a masterpiece) and it delivered in almost every way to me. \n\nWhile it played it somewhat safe by following the now-typical Shinkai formula (down to RADWIMPS doing the soundtrack again), it still went in surprising directions. It didn't glamorize Tokyo as the dream destination for a teenage runaway and it didn't hold back from showing the ugly sides of the town and the downright nasty situations someone can find themselves in. The police subplot wasn't pretty but that was the point.\n\nThe male protagonist also doesn't get away with his reckless actions at the end, even though he managed to save the one he loved. He's caught by the police, sent back to his abusive father and unable to reunite with his girl for three years. There's consequences and there's repeated reminders about keeping one's feet on the ground (no pun intended), which come dangerously close to disrupt the hopeful and feel-good rescue scene. For a brief moment, you're taken out of the idealistic wish-fulfillment because to anyone but Hodaka, Hina and the onii-chad, their whole story is a bunch of fantastical nonsense, no matter how true it actually is. \n\nI appreciate that Shinkai didn't shy away from incorporating dark elements and while it didn't always work flawlessly, it worked well enough to not drag the movie down but instead help make Weathering with You arguably the most intriguing entry in his filmography (along with the commentary on global warming, which somehow managed to not be political).\n\nIt goes without saying that this movie is absolutely stunning to look at and listen to from start to finish. Tokyo was as vibrant as ever, the raindrops were as breathtaking as in Garden of Words, the climactic scene is already one for the ages and most importantly, that Big Mac was ridiculous. I left the theater very satisfied and I can't wait to rewatch it on Blu-Ray (and catch more of those Your Name easter eggs since I apparently missed half of them).", "My third favorite Shinkai film. Here's my rankings:\n\n1. 5cm Per Second\n1. Your Name\n1. Weathering With You\n1. Garden of Words\n1. Children Who Chase Lost Voices\n1. The Place Promised in Our Early Days\n1. Voices of a Distant Star", "Okay. Can somebody please explain the ending to me? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. \n\nMy take-away is that Hodaka is a selfish teen whose juvenile infatuation and selfish actions have doomed all of man-kind, not just japan, since sea levels kind of affect the whole planet. LA, New York, Mumbai, Shanghai, Venice. Gone. \n\nBut the ending is super up-beat and happy because he got the girl? Are we meant to take this at face value? Or is the movie not endorsing his actions? What's the message? That humanity will constantly pursue it's own self-interests at the expense of the planet? I feel like that's an awesome ending, but I have a hard time believing that was the intention. Maybe if it played it straight, but the final reunion is presented so joyously and romantically, that are we suppose to be happy? \n\nAnd also there's that terrible monologue Hodaka gives about how Japan was underwater thousands of years ago, and it's fine if it returns to that. It feels like the movie is trying to spin it. Or is it just the main character trying to justify his own actions? I want to believe the movie is smarter than the main character, but I don't know. I'd really like to know what other peoples reactions were to the ending.", "Just saw it. It was visually appealing and had some good ideas, but I felt like it didn't operate on any kind of internal logic... Just a lot of plot contrivances. Falls apart if you examine it at all. Didn't expect them to actually follow through with a sunken Tokyo though... I'd like to see more about that.", "Not as good as Your Name even a little, but I'll be damned if this movie didn't make me want to fall in love with a girl who could theoretically stop global warming.", "While I found this movie beautiful, I couldn\u2019t help but appreciate what lightning in a bottle KNNW truly was.", "Was able to see this a while back. I\u2019m pretty mixed on it to be honest. \n\nEDIT: wanted to give a spoiler-warning\n\nIt\u2019s gorgeously animated, surprisingly hilarious, and has a very charming cast of characters, but I felt like it was melodramatic at certain points (the gun), the narrative beats of the love story felt very derivative of Your Name, and has somewhat of a controversial message about climate change.\n\nThe parts with the gun just felt very out of place. Maybe this is just coming from an American perspective but it feels like not much was said with this heavy story element and is more of just a narrative device to increase the stakes of the climax.\n\nThe climax was also somewhat frustrating as the conflict is predicated on whether or not the supernatural elements exist from the perspective of the characters. Obviously as the audience we know it does but it also makes sense for the other characters in the story to not believe it. Since the conflict relies on this lack of information instead of the more interesting moral or philosophical conflict it introduces, it fell a bit flat for me.\n\nThe supernatural elements also feel a bit underdeveloped. I feel like more may have been intended with this alternate world since its teased throughout the film but ultimately nothing particularly interesting is done with this and it barely gets any screen time.\n\nI did really enjoy the end twist however as I did not expect them to commit to it. It was a shocking but effective transition and seeing how the world would adjust was quite interesting. I almost wish the second half of the film was post-disaster and explored more of what life would be like, kind of similar to the beginning of Avengers: Endgame. That said I feel like the film is saying that there is nothing we can do about climate change which feels like the wrong message to send.\n\nAlternatively perhaps we can read the climate change aspect as a metaphor for a relationship, where you commit to the storm that is a relationship when you are in love whether its right or not.\n\nOverall it was still very entertaining and worth watching, even if only for the beautiful animation and the discussion around climate change.", "I found Hodaka\u2019s journey to preserve his happiness very compelling. Tokyo is flooded due to his decision to save Hina, and a lot of people would view this as the worst possible outcome, although I think this serves as the moral of the film. He bears the responsibility of flooding Tokyo but that doesn\u2019t mean he should bear the burden of sacrificing his loved ones to \u201csave the world.\u201d Sometimes if you really want something, you just gotta go for it.", "Don't you think it's a problem when the top 1% of the top 1% of japanese schoolgirls control 90% of the japanese weather?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe world needs better distribution of weather maidens!", "I saw the movie alone at the premiere at my country since I figured probably no of my friends would want to see it. It perhaps was not on the level of Your name and it had some issues but it still gave me that satisfying feeling that I was looking for. I wanted to see that beautiful love story of between two people, which anime is so good at illustrating.\n\nI'm older now and no longer the innocent teenager who thought the idea of the One and unconditional love was true. Reality has shown me it is only fiction but I still see these kind of movies to at least get a glimpse of how it would be and perhaps a small part of me still wants to believe in it.\n\nThe animation is so beautiful and the music amplifies the feelings the movie wants to convey. Thank you Shinkai!", "I felt a little bored at times but I did like the cameos from the leads of Your Name. It's interesting Makoto Shinkai stated this movie took place right after the events of YN.", "Hey Taki and Mitsuha are here with steady jobs. That\u2019s nice. Later as Tokyo falls, Jesus they got done in by a thirsty kid who couldn\u2019t let go.", "I admire it greatly, but I don't fully love it like I did *Your Name*.\n\nNevertheless, the thematic weight and depth here cannot be overstated and I appreciate Shinkai is using his unique position to make very  ambitious and definitive statements with his films rather than just crowd-pleasers. When he can do both, that's amazing.", "Movie was good that I'd recommend but had alot of unanswered questions and unnecessary parts\n\n1) why was the gun there? What's the importance of it for the actual movie plot besides it being a political thing? The movie would not be impacted much if it was removed bc the police would've been still looking for hadoka since he was reported as missing\n\n2) not much background about the gods. Why was a fox god mentioned but barely any details about it. Dragon God had more info but still not plentiful\n\n3) that shrine had a cucumber and eggplant on it that looked perfectly new. Is there someone who's upkeeping it and also knows about its secret? \n\n4) doesn't make sense why hadoka pulled a gun on Mr.suga (that easily too) since he sheltered and fed that boy? He had a good relationship with that boy too\n\n5) can anyone become a weather maiden? It said there was a weather maiden in each village so if it's like that then why does it seem like all of Japan would sink just bc of hina's feelings? There has to be other sunshine girls that could help (at least slow down the sinking of Japan) \n\n6) hina's feelings are connected to the weather so when she's normal it's raining. But when she's happy the weather isn't affected how come it's only when she's praying?  \n\nThere's other holes you kinda have to guess like about hadokas background and hina's. Also ending was abrupt like crazy!!! Other than that I cried and it was musically and artistically amazing. It was good but def not the best.", "A lot of the people here are hating on the ending, and I think it's was kinda iffy too. Having listened to the post credit interview Makoto Shinkai makes a point about how he wanted to make a movie about climate change as it's a big issue currently. I wonder if the ending was supposed to be a metaphor for how humans are selfish and always put themselves forward regardless of what's good for the world/mankind as a whole. We are basically doing what Hodaka is doing, in thinking about ourselves and not really what the planet is going to be in like 20 years from now or further out.", "Maybe the point of this movie flew over my head or the ending is as dumb as I think it is. Tokyo is damned to eternal rainfall and flooding so this brat can get his girl.....\n\nVisually I think it was some of the best animation I have seen. To be honest I really did not feel much sympathy for the main character and I find it odd that the person who needs to grow up really doesn\u2019t by the end of the movie. He gets what he wants and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much consequence on his end other than waiting for 3 years.", "I loved this movie because to me it's a beautiful metaphorical tale of what it's like to be in love. \n\nIt can start off with a simple, kind gesture\u2014and before you know it, you're spiraling into a world of mystery. Love is something we grow up hearing about, but nothing can prepare you for its arrival. It's like a beautiful sunrise, starting off with blushing reds and warmth, slowly enveloping you until you're helplessly soaked in sunlight.\n\nWhen you're in love, you find a new sun to revolve around, and as much as you can, you want to bask in its light. As you unravel as much as you can about each others' pasts, futures, and destinies, all of the unknowable and unexplained can be daunting. But along the way, you learn that you don't need the answers to everything, the present and your feelings can be enough.\n\nThe world around you seems to change and it's not something that's easy to explain. Like trying to convince someone that she's the reason the sun shines, words don't seem vibrant or intimate enough to describe the experience itself.\n\nWith time, your relationship evolves to a point where many other relationships have ended. You're asked to commit and to sacrifice. To leap into the unknown. To give up what you have for an unsure future. Logic only points away, but the heart pushes on. You offer up your fears and doubts because you trust that person to be your sunshine, even if it rains for the rest of your life. Even though they have the power to break your heart, you fearlessly leave it in their hands. You defy destiny and deny countless futures for one together. It's scary and worldchanging, but it's beautiful and it's worth it all.\n\nWhen the world floods and the rains keep pouring, you know that all will be well, because she'll be there, weathering all of it with you.", "Just watched it and I absolutely loved it. I completely disagree with people calling this film too similar to Your Name. It definitely shared a similar plot structure, but this film seemingly had so much more to say. \n\nThe themes of adolescence, the contrast between fantasy/reality, and the Catcher in the Rye parallel were brilliant in my opinion. The romance was obviously the soul of the movie, but it was grounded in this conflict between the whimisical escapist fantasies of youth and the adult realities of responsibility and pessimism. Hakoda came to Tokyo to pursue a literal escapist fantasy. It almost seemed like a parallel to the American Dream, except his dream was just to be free. Him hitting the wall that is capitalism and a big city was a huge wake up call, but he didn't give up on being free. There's a great contrast with his line \"I hate Tokyo,\" which iirc comes after he gets pushed into the trash can outside the club. Then about 10 or 15 minutes later, he says \"Tokyo is amazing\" (I can't remember in response to what). His childlike wonder is great, even though he's completely ostracized. The fact that he has the Catcher in the Rye in his little cubby when he first gets to Tokyo is such a neat detail.\n\nHina is then a perfect portrayal of abandoned youth. Society exploits her both as a dancer in a club (a fucking 15 yr old girl, and fuck was that twist hard for me), and then as the sunshine girl. Not to mention throughout this time she chooses to go through with both these exploitations for others' sake. First for her brother, and then because she feels she's only worthwhile if she can make people smile. Shinkai showed us these aspects of her character along with very subtle connections drawn between the city and the treatment of ostracized children. The interactions Hakoda has at the beginning of the film help me infer what Hina must have gone through for a year between her mother's death and the events of the film. And being a girl, she's had it muuuch worse. People are undervaluing this when discussing Hina's character. \n\nUltimately the more fantastical elements fit so well in contrast with the more mature themes. The fantastical elements to me stand out as a kind of manifestation of Hakoda, as well as Hina and Nagi's, desires to reject society and just be together and free as kids. That scene in the hotel room solidified it for me. They just want to be kids. The city is playing an antagonistic role that doesn't allow that though. The law and financial responsibility serve to separate them. Then the weather ties in to represent that antagonistic nature as well. The fact that the rain constantly serves to make Hakoda's life more difficult in the beginning while he doesn't have a roof over his head, and he's getting pushed around and ostracized, makes for such a good visual metaphor. It's also neat how the weather serves to help and hurt Hakoda and Hina. I don't have to explain Hina's situation, but Hakoda utilizing the wet floor to escape several times, while being slowed down by it at other times. It all connects so damn well.\n\nI loved this film and I wholeheartedly disagree with people claiming it's too similar to Your Name. Shinkai was going for something very different here. I'm really excited to watch it again.\n\nEdit: WOW, whoever gave me silver, thank you! It's my first time and I didn't think someone would like this comment that much for them to give me silver. Thanks!", "This movie looks spectacular, even better than Your Name, though there are a lot of plot things that just didn't really vibe with me. \n\nI really didn't know anything about Hodaka or why he left outside of some vague statements, I understand how sometimes you don't want to over explain things, but there is just nothing mentioned at all about his life back where he lived before running away to Tokyo.\n\nThe gun subplot was whatever to me and it felt like it was there just to tie together 2 or 3 parts of the movie. \n\nThe cameos were so baffling to me I spent a lot of the movie just wondering why they did that in the first place. \n\nAlso it's hard for me to deal with the ending where Hodaka straight up sank all of Tokyo for this girl, and the last 5 minutes of the movie are spent with people who were directly affected by the consequences telling him it's not his fault when it quite literally is.\n\nEven so I still did enjoy watching this movie and thing it's a decent follow up to Your Name which I still adore.", "Overall liked a lot but \"epilogue\" felt really anticlimactic/ unnecessary. Parts were unexplored/unexplained e.g. mass water falling down (like the beginning), so what are the negative effects from overusing power? (we only see early snow lol), and how he rescues her... why not make a cycle where each time she disappears he can rescue her each time.\n\nThe characters are definitely better here than in Your Name. I prefer Weathering with You more\n\nvery inspired by Catcher in the Rye, movie is brave to even show it haha", "It such a well animated movie, and I've loved Shinkai for so long, that I really want to like this movie. But I just can't. I've always though Shinkai's movies always had some somewhat similar themes, not every theme but some, and similar aesthetics, but the way the story was told and characters always felt different. Even with similar aesthetics, the atmosphere wasn't the same, but not with Weathering With You, it just feels like its taking too many ques from Your Name. It just doesn't feel nearly as creative as his other works. \n\nAlso am the only who noticed there were like 2 montages that had like 15 - 20 minute gap between them? It felt so glaring.", "Weathering With You was beautifully animated. Keisuke was probably the best character in the film because of development, and he was engaging in the movie. \n\nThe rest of the characters are likable. The story feels too similar to Your Name. You already saw similar plot points if you saw Your Name. \n\nThe story still engaging, but there pacing around the second act that feels a bit of a rush. Dub is pretty good.\n\nI feel like I got ripped off because I went to watch it to the fan screening, and the tickets for Fathom cost like $18. That is the same amount of price for paying to watch an Imax movie in my city. \n\nI liked the movie still. I rather pay for the regular ticket price. I still recommend checking it out, but don't pay $18 for it as I did.", "Climate change is caused by 15 year olds wanting to fuck, got it", "TL;DW\n\nLocal teen boy drowns Tokyo for pussy. \n\nSlightly average storyline aside, I felt the pacing for the first half of the film was incredibly slow and was unnecessary. Some aspects like the gun were a bit odd and felt like an out of place addition. Visuals were absolutely fantastic, and the side characters were enjoyable. \n\n7/10", "From the perspective of someone who has only watched a handful of anime over the past decade (and has no knowledge of the director's previous movie), I'd say this movie was not bad.  If you have it in your head that you don't like anime, it probably won't be the piece to change your mind.\n\nThe animation is good throughout and beautiful in some sequences.  The dialogue can be overwrought in places, but is mostly fine, and I was thoroughly entertained by the little brother character.", "Damn it was hard to find seats for this!\n\nI enjoyed it quite a bit. Animation was beautiful and I thought the resolution was interesting. Wasn't as great as Your Name though.", "It was fantastic", "I loved this film. I definitely need to see more films from this studio. Your Name was fantastic too. \n\nAlso, did anyone else think the VA for Hodaka sounded like Tom Holland at times?", "Finally saw it today. Overall impression , i like it. It may not be as good as Your Name, but not many movies are anyway. I thought the movie did a good job telling the story of 3 underage kids trying to live on their own , together. Sure the action got a little bit overblown near the 3rd act climax, but then that\u2019s just par course for that confusingly emotional stage of life. \n\nOn the ending though , I think many people got It wrong about Hodaka\u2019s action. The film itself told us in many occasions that this constant rain and water level was THE status quo for Tokyo bay. It was heavily implied that sacrificing the maidens was what made humanities selfish development possible. Basically , making the weather maidens to change weather is bad. Letting nature running its course is good , for both nature and the maidens and the humanities too. That\u2019s my take away , anyhow. \n\nThat and Nagi could teach me a thing or two about the ladies...", "I don\u2019t get how people are mad that a child didn\u2019t want to sacrifice her own life to stop the rain. Seriously, would you volunteer to be a human sacrifice for the weather gods? We can feed you to the rain fish. Real fun stuff. \n\nIt makes no sense to me. Sure, you don\u2019t think her life matters much, but to her, that life is everything. Why is it so wrong to want to live?", "With all of the reviews being relatively decent compared to Your Name, I went not expecting something in the same realm but I thought this movie delivered incredibly! I loved having the twist on the ending where the character makes a selfish move. The music was just as awesome as Your Name (Radwimps and Shinkai just work so well together), beautiful animation, fun characters. Still give this one a 10/10 as well and it\u2019s probably top 5 for the decade in movies (Your Name is number 2 behind Mad max Fury Road).", "Dayum, I didn't think Tokyo would get rekt the way it did in a 'coming of age' film. I really enjoyed this film for its own merits, but it's hard not to compare it to Your Name (not taking anything away from Weathering With You). \n\nAlso, loved how MC's most delicious food in the world turned out to be a Big Mac\u2122, hunger really is the best sauce in the world.", "Sure it's similar to your name but I gotta say that's some amazing animation and graphics, with such a sweet story and love interest my heart is happy again. If you like any kind of romance, anime, or marine biology or if you really just hate Japan it's a must sea.", "I think I just want some of the more fantasy elemenys of the story fleshed out, but at the same time maybe it doesn't really need to be because no one in the world knows what they are.\n\nI'm also thinking this is a story told in Hodaka's perspective, so it can be argued that not a lot needs to be explained because we only know what he knows. In your name we see both characters' perspectives. \n\nThis can also explain all the boob staring Hodaka did.", "Reposting what I put in another thread, as this is now the official one and therefore will have more discussion =) \n\nSaw this in a double bill with Your Name, which really highlighted just how much on another level Your Name is in pretty much every sense. Weathering With You was still good, and an excellent film, but there were more than a few little niggles that I couldn't help but have.\n\n \u2022 Far too much of the humour kinda fell flat, especially as a good amount was \"heh, boobs, am I right?\". Whilst Your Name obviously had those kind of jokes too, they were spaced out well and much better delivered.\n\n \u2022 Characters didn't seem as fleshed out as the two from Your Name, leaving the emotional beats less impactful. \n\n \u2022 Narrative wise, Your Name is structurally put together better. It introduces many elements early, either directly or in passing (twilight, sake, comet, etc) that pay off well later, or even just reappear for a good throw back joke. Weathering With You seemed to have much less of that outside a couple of elements, though I might have missed things and should give it a second viewing. Furthermore, it was just simpler. Once the main elements were in place, there was very little that shocked or surprised me - not always a bad thing, but for the most part we were just jogging towards the predictable conclusion.\n\n \u2022 Over-reliance on music. There were more than a few scenes which could have made much more of an impact if we were left to process what had just happened, rather than having a full-length soft rock song interrupt.\n\nDespite these quibbles, I'd still say it's a great film - having the experience of getting to see Your Name on the big screen for the first time has kinda meant that I can't help to compare the two films and frankly, Your Name is a masterpiece. Definitely go and see it, but please don't expect it to be on the same level as Your Name.", "Obviously found the film visually stunning, but I felt it lacked a lot of substance. Lots of plot points that should've been developed or at least looked at were missing (hodaka's abusive? household, the gun, sky fish). The fanservice scenes didn't fit in with the rest of the film and didn't enjoy those bits. Also I guess the moral of the film is don't grieve your dead mom or you'll cause the apocalypse?", "Pretty disappointed with this film. I absolutely adored Your Name, due to its ability to build backstories for each of the main characters and make you care about them...to which this movie did a very poor job of doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if I'm not mistaken, Hokada's reasoning to runaway from home to a completely different part of the country was because...he felt suffocated from living at home and his small town. But he's 16. Every 16 year old in the world feels this way, how is that any kind of justification for  completely ditching your family? I could understand if his parents were physically/emotionally abusive (which I thought the film would explore when he was shown in the beginning with bruises and bandages on his face) but it never did!!! If you want me to sympathize with a runaway juvenile, then you need to provide something more than \"I felt like I was suffocating\". Really lost the opportunity to make Hokada into a martyr, and instead made him into an entitled brat.  \n\n\nI felt like the movie also jumped focus too much in terms of characters. It spent a decent amount of time on Suga and his family (with the meeting of his mother-in-law), of course some of the time with Hina, and some of the time with Suga's niece...but it felt too cluttered. I wish the film would have made Suga/his niece into more ancillary characters while devoting more screen time to build a more thorough backstory for Hokada/Hina.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShinkai films are always visually stunning, so I had zero issue in that department. This just feels like parts of four different movie plots jumbled into one and ultimately it makes for a lackluster film.", "When Hina disappears as soon where Hodaka is about to give her the ring I immediately said \"not again\".  obviously its not Your Name but its a close second and whether thats a good or a bad thing thats up you but I definitely enjoyed it!!", "I'm so glad it was just me and my friends in the theater because I chould not stop laughing at the 3rd act", "I am honestly surprised that RADWIMPS was still able to deliver such an amazing soundtrack, which is easily the best part of the film. Aside from the gorgeous visuals and sound design, the narrative just fell flat for me. The foreshadowing was done so painfully obvious the twist was quite predictable, and even then it just felt anticlimactic. The ending was very unsatisfying and I really wished that Shinkai opted for a more melancholic one like Your Name. However, on a technical scale, this movie is pretty much on point with the animation, ost and etc. There were scenes that gave me goosebumps because of the overwhelming visuals and track. Overall I enjoyed Weathering with You, but I can't deny the few major narrative flaws that brought down the quality of the film. Maybe a high 7 or low 8 out of 10 if I had to rate it.", "Who'd've thought Josuke would grow up to be a jaded detective in Tokyo?", "The animation was gorgeous. I didn\u2019t think Disney would be topped when it comes to water effects, but Weathering With You does it so effortlessly. The music was top notch as expected from RADWIMPS, and I found the characters very charming. I greatly appreciate the Your Name cameos. My biggest issue is with how the story ended and the themes it espouses. On one hand I admire how the story didn\u2019t cop out, Tokyo suffers consequences for Hodaka saving Hina. However the those very consequences that leave me so unsatisfied. It makes Hodaka whose was engaging as a protagonist quite unlikable though I suppose that was the director\u2019s intention. Overall I enjoyed the film though it was not near the level of Your Name.", "Alright, so I just got out from seeing it and right now I\u2019m feeling pretty \u201cmeh\u201d towards it. Like everyone says it\u2019s very beautifully animated (most of the time) and that\u2019s great and all, but a lot of it felt really flat to me. Honaka was your stereotypical boy protagonist to an annoying degree. Even his design was so basic and bland. I swear I\u2019ve seen this Kirito-esque look so much now that I\u2019m tired of it. I also didn\u2019t like the niece Natsumi. Seemed to be used for eye candy mostly and that\u2019s it. When that scene of Honaka enters Keisuke\u2019s house the first time and he\u2019s trying to look at her tits my eyes were rolling out my head. Like, \u201cOh God here we go.\u201d I\u2019ve been into anime for a good while now and I know these cliches exist, and I can even enjoy them sometime when it\u2019s some kind of trashy seasonal show, but they\u2019re seriously doing this in their big budget motion picture? Come on dude. And it happened a couple of times. \u201cEh?! Are you looking at my boobs?\u201d It sounds like something you\u2019d get from a parody of anime. I\u2019m not a prude. Who doesn\u2019t like anime tiddies? It just felt so out of place here. The brother character I did enjoy. I was expecting his scene in the bus to just be a one off joke about how kids act older in the city, so it was surprising when he came back and was generally enjoyable and funny. Hina was.....fine. \n\nThe CGI was bad. Despite having product placement for every company under the sun they still couldn\u2019t afford hand drawn animation for their wide sweeping shots huh? \n\nI\u2019m also confused on the message. It was oddly political but I can\u2019t tell in what way. There was this weird mix of climate change denial and climate change is hurting us we need to do something about message. \n\nI actually liked the ending somewhat though. Felt very human he\u2019d pick a girl he loves over the weather(maybe?) destroying large parts of the world. I could see how someone young would do that and not think of the consequences. Though honestly it was kind of unclear how this power worked or why she got it. Like I know she prayed at the shrine but the weather was bad for a while right? Why did it pick her and not another person who came to the shrine? How did Hodaka get sent there too without praying or being chosen as a weather maiden? A lot of the story felt all over the place.\n\nIt was cute, but if I had to sum it up with one word it\u2019d be \u2018disappointing.\u2019 Or perhaps \u2018schmaltzy.\u2019", "Dudes will do anything for pussy man, I swear.", "I kinda see where the director is coming from when he said something on the lines as \"Please don't say Your Name is my greatest movie.\" He pretty much has that standard now over his head.\n\nOverall though, I don't know if its just me but it felt like I was watching the same movie (Your Name). Out of curiosity do all Japanese animated movies in this particular genre have a happy ending?\n\nBut still, I had a good time watching the film. The music was intrusive at times but man, I do love the score. It was pretty funny at times as well. Characters are relate able. Plot was again almost the same as Your Name. Visually it was pretty stunning at times, if not better than Your Name and I would highly recommend a viewing!", "As a showcase for animation, it was absolutely damn gorgeous, without a doubt - even better than Your Name.

I\u2019ve seen all of Shinkai\u2019s previous films and this is probably his worst work so far.\n\nIt felt like a rehash of Your Name (Kimi no na wa) with less interesting characters and much worse pacing. The Your Name cameos were also unnecessary. It feels like Shinkai is plagued with trying to one-up his previous success with Your Name by trying - and failing - to emulate what made it successful.\n\nRegarding the ending, some people here drew parallels with The Last of Us, and I have to say Weathering with You falls flat with its execution.\n\nWith all that said, I\u2019m still excited for Shinkai\u2019s next work. He\u2019s had a good track record so far and one bad film doesn\u2019t ruin my opinion of him as an artist.", "[deleted]", "I saw this at TIFF last year and it was one of two screenings out of the 50+ I've been to where nobody clapped. The other was Lucy in the Sky. I hope GAs liked it better.\n\nPersonally, I thought it was decent. I preferred it a bit to Your Name due to narrative cohesion, but I feel Shinkai's earlier work was his best. Garden of Names is A+ levels of tragic and heartwarming, and the same production designer of that did this and this film looks great. I think this film was an attempt to please fans of Your Name while reintroducing the darker themes and tine of Shinkai's older work, and I think it doesn't always work. I found the product placement overwhelming and the thesis/implications unclear/at odds with each other. Still, I liked the cast of characters and RADWIMPS is great as always. 7/10.

Lives were upended, property was lost, but when you consider that the other option is human sacrifice, it doesn't sound that bad.

And I'll insist in the 3D animation since I don't think it's normal. Having some 3D animation in a complicated scene in a series, I can understand, the animators are underpaid, don't have the time, neither for themselves neither for finishing their work.

Why was it written? How did it make it into a major Hollywood production? What the fuck? Why did the director not shut it down immediately? Why did the executives not shut this shit down?", "There's no way anybody is actually going to go see this, right?", "And just like that, Robert Downey Jr. goes from Iron Man saves the universe to pulling objects out of a dragon's asshole in order to save the Queen. This movie is such a terrible mess I don't even know where to start. You see a low RT score like that and you think it's probably just boring or maybe it just doesn't work, but this is a Frankenstein's monster of a movie. Issues and problems just stitched together in such a barely passable way I can't even imagine kids giving a shit about it. \n\nFirst and foremost, RDJ what is you doin? You could barely understand his accent, every line of his looked and sounded like it was added in post, and you could tell he had nothing physical to work with in all the animal scenes. Picking up a gorillas arm as if it was a tube of wrapping paper. Him and the animals always felt very separate in the sense that they were always running around knocking things over and being boisterous but never really interacting with him physically. \n\nThat's probably a symptom of how I'd imagine this movie was made in very separate phases. Principle photography seemed like it was just totally breezed through. Didn't even feel like RDJ was saying half his lines in the moment and it feels like no one sat down and actually wrote this movie. This is what I'd imagine the script looks like:\n\n*night on the boat*\n\n*Dolittle stares at the sky. Boy interrupts him. They talk.*\n\nBoy: I think I'm starting to understand the animals. \n\n*Dolittle replies.* \n\n*Bottom line of this scene is we have to stop at this island.*\n\nIt seems like RDJ just acted things out when filming, then they stitched the plot together after and added a bunch of lines to convey it, then they got a bunch of solid actors to voice animals by saying it's RDJs next big franchise, then they just sprinkled those animal lines everywhere. Boom, movie. Terrible, boring, nonsensical movie. But, movie. \n\nYou know what really grinds my gears? Boring teen actors. This movie starts with two of the most boring kids I've ever seen. Nothing interesting about them. The kid likes animals but is the son of a hunter, what a twist. He wants to go with Dolittle, after they look in on the sick queen he says, \"I was useful in there!\" Like man I forgot you were in that scene. He did nothing almost the entire movie. Dolittle sends him home just to wait for literally nothing to change so the animals can have a wacky chase scene kidnapping him from home. \n\nAlso can we talk about how the talking to animals works in this movie? First off, seemingly anyone can do it because it's treated like just knowing the translation. When we first see Dolittle he's talking to animals on their language then it transitions to tell us basically when he's talking to animals he's speaking a different language. OKAY BUT THEN HOW DOES HE TALK TO MULTIPLE SPECIES AT ONCE. OR HUMANS AND ANIMALS AT THE SAME TIME. It makes no fucking sense and it's so obvious it's just because no one cared to try. \n\nOkay, so it's a bad movie. There were some funny moments and characters. But all the voice acting was so bland and he had a really weird relationship with his parrot and everything is so poorly stitched together once you got one good moment it was overshadowed by three terrible things in like a minute. Animals were drugging RDJ without his consent, blowing up armories, there were a lot of weird moments in this movie. It would honestly take several rewatches and pages of writing to even scratch the surface on why it was so nonsensical and weird. \n\n3/10 and those points are mainly because the animals looked and felt more natural than the Lion King remake.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "All of you who paid to see this piece of shit are the reason why these pieces of shit keep getting made.", "I guess this is the hell Iron Man went to when he died.", "Well, it lives up To the title...", "The way they cut the scenes are really off.

And then the level of excitement/amazement from those two was so underwhelming, they\u2019re watching a manor of animals help perform surgery and they\u2019re just smiling like oh this is ok pretty fun I guess. \n\nThe choice of the voice actors was horrible casting, the voices didn\u2019t match the animals very well and put me off it very quickly. The only one I didn\u2019t mind was Octavia as the duck but they kept ramming the celery/leek joke down our throats and it didn\u2019t work once in our cinema. Ralph finnes was decent as the tiger too. Couldn\u2019t stand John cena and whoever was the gorilla and the French fox annoyed me too.\n\nTouching on that 95% of the jokes didn\u2019t work and were met with silence I don\u2019t know how it made it to the point of being recorded for this film as they were rapid firing all these jokes which were flopping.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nThe lead up to it having a constipated dragon was such a weak payoff, I enjoy a fart joke more then the average man but my goodness this part was long in the tooth.\n\nAlso what happened to the other DR villain? Did he die or just run off never to be seen again, and why did they keep trying to force down the he has no chin jokes. He looked pretty normal dude with a beard but they went hard or chin jokes like he was missing his lower jaw.\n\nAnd the villain who poisoned the queen, surely he could\u2019ve come up with something better that when Doolittle gets told about what happened from the stick insect and he\u2019s like \u201coh sure an insect told him SUREEEE\u201d the whole premise is he can talk to animals ya dipshit it seems everyone in this movie knows he can but you, regardless of him travelling with a board of animals at all times.\n\nThis may not work for everyone and may feel lazy but based off the trailer and from first few minutes of the film I thought it was gonna be ok mrs dolittle is lost at sea presumed dead, Doolittle becomes a recluse and closes his business. Then years later a seagull trained by the wife arrives at the manor and passes on the message she\u2019s alive on this island, so he sets off with a crew of people as he doesn\u2019t want to take all these land based animals to help but then the animals have hid in the ship and come up kick all the crew off and then help him trek through dangerous seas to find her.\n\nMassive rant but damn I thought this would be decent but they really stuffed it up.

It's the least grounded movie I've seen in a while.\n\nWorse of all, it was just so goddamn boring. It felt low-stakes and fake. I started dozing off during the boat-chase scene with the weird fucking whale sonar thing and Michael Sheen making bad jokes about his chin or some shit.

The only part of the movie that had half a chance at being cool (the pirate island) they just completely glossed over and ruined.\n\nAlso I feel like the movie would have been at least 30% better if the animals had possessed voice actors with accents from the geographic region that those animals were supposed to be from (like an African accent for the ostrich, Indian accent for the tiger, etc...) and not just random comedians making bad one-liners. It was super weird that all the animals had obvious American accents and talked with slang dialogue while everyone else spoke in Victorian English (and memes, apparently).\n\nI couldn't be more disappointed, RDJ is one of my favorite actors and Dr. Dolittle was one of my favorite series of books as a kid.", "Went from making bank at Marvel to doing January movies.", "According to Rotten Tomatoes: Four worse than Cats", "I can't believe it took 4 ADULT people to write this pile of shit", "I had low expectations so I thought it was just bad, not quite a Cats level disaster.", "I didn't think it was as bad as what people have been saying.

The constant ADRs, the godawful attempts at humor. It's a less comfortable experience than Cats for me. At least Cats has really great dancers from around the world doing their best with Tom Hooper's awful attempt at directing motion capture. This has nothing.\n\nAlmost every single celebrity voice actor puts no effort to their animal roles. Marion Cotillard's Tutu sounds like she was recording from her bedroom. Selena Gomez sounds so bored. Only John Cena sounds like he gave a shit, and he gave more shit voicing a polar bear than RDJ was at acting as Dr.Dolittle.\n\nIt's like they've decided to mix the worst parts of Cats, Madagascar 2 and Holmes & Watson into one movie, hoping for RDJ to coast on it as much as he could.

He does a really good accent in Sherlock, but this one had bits of Irish, Scottish, English, Aussie, German and more. There were scenes where I literally thought they could have put Taika Waititi in his place and I wouldn't have told the difference.  The second thing was the little boy's character. Pointless.

I recently binged the first 2 movies over the weekend, so this is all fresh in my mind.\n\nIn the 1st movie, Martin and Will had equal screen time and importance.  Will was the playboy action junkie, so he embraced the action.  Martin was the cautious family man, who could partake in the action when it was brought to him, but he did not seek it.  It was an action movie, but Will's smooth playboy and Martin's aggressive comedian personalities were on full display and were equally important.\n\nThen in the 2nd movie, Will and Martin were still equals...but Will was \"more equal\" than Martin.  Will took more of the lead in the action and plot and made stuff happen while dragging Martin along.  The camera also focused on Will a lot of the time and his image usually dominated the screen.  Martin was given a lot of the emotional core of the movie (with his little sister being in constant danger), but his character seemed very neutered in this movie.  He wasn't as loud or aggressive as in the first movie.  He wasn't given a lot to do action wise and was kinda portrayed as slightly less competent compared to Will Smith (whereas he was Will's equal in the first movie).  Even his comedy was diminished, as it was more based on wackiness than Martin's \"in your face\" personality.\n\nNow in this new movie, Will Smith is the full blown main character here.  He has top billing in this movie (Martin had top billing in the first 2).  The story is about him completely.  He drives the plot forward entirely.  He performs the large majority of the action scenes.  Everybody exists in the story to serve and support his character.  Martin is pretty much a supporting character in this movie.  He has way less screen time than Will (he even disappeared at one point in the movie).  He doesn't do any of the action scenes, besides a few hits at the very end.  Granted, he still provides the heart in the movie, but it's in service of Will's character instead of his own.  Even his comedy took a hit in this movie, as he had less opportunities to be comedic compared to the 2nd movie.\n\nI'm sorry for such a long rant, but I hated seeing Martin's role diminish in these films.  His character was just as interesting and important as Will's character.  This movie could've been a real comeback for Martin as a leading man, but he just wasn't portrayed like it.  But I will say that the material that Martin was given, he nailed it though.  He hit the emotional and funny beats really well.", "Had a blast with it. So awesome Joe Carnahan was involved in some level with it. Only thing I felt wrong with it was the first third is a little slow and wish we had more Michael Bay like shots otherwise it was a fantastic time and definitely holds its own.", "Been a huge fan since the first one. I love that they managed to add some emotional weight to the story. I actually gasped when Capt Howard was killed. A straight up gut punch. I don't know if they should continue with another film but this was a great trilogy capper.", "Loved this...immediately made me want to rewatch the first two after all those years. And I just watched first 5 minutes of BB and it is hilarious how similarly the two films begin. It is clear the belgian morrocans know their shit, which explains why the film was so damn great.", "So much better than I thought it would be.  And Reggie is back.  Such a good cameo", "I keep seeing talk shit on bad boys II and I don't understand it, that movie has action scenes in the middle that rival most action movies finales. This movie doesn't do that, and it's not as funny, but there are some great action shots and there are some great laughs. But damn, I will never understand the hate for BBII, it's masterpiece excess", "What a pleasant surprise. I'll be honest, while I hope all movies are good, I had almost no hope for this movie. Will Smith hot on the heels of Gemini Man (which had an oddly similar plot, I found) in a way too late sequel to a legitimate action classic getting a January release. Just didn't see it happening, but I've gotta say, while this may not go down as a classic it is way better than it needs to be. Everyone in it seemed to be all in, the writing was surprisingly good, the villain was interesting. It's certainly not perfect, but it didn't fall into the trap so many too late sequels fall into where they rely on the name and fail to grasp what made the movies great. \n\nWill Smith and Martin Lawrence both seemed like they were having a great time, which is so important to the series. I was honestly worried Smith may have gotten Lawrence to do this and he was gonna be lazy and out of shape and given not as much as superstar Will to do, but the movie was pretty good at playing up the strengths. Martin Lawrence just isn't an action star anymore but he was still useful to the movie and his arc of realizing he needs glasses was kind of a cool way to be like, we know these guys are old we aren't trying to make them young again. \n\nThe supporting cast was also all in. Maybe it was just seeing Joe Pantoliano as the Captain again that made me so happy. And then so sad when he was the major death, it should have been obvious but this movie had me focused on other things so I didn't expect it. Also, the trailer didn't sell me on this new hip team of tech youngsters, but the movie did a little better. They still got those tropey three line backstories to explain their arcs here and there, but they were actually pretty cool, even the annoying one used his eccentricities to help with the plot. And when the big guy went off he WENT OFF.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, that the action and style is on point for this series. I could tell these directors really studied Bay's style. The camera almost never stops moving when the movie is moving, the ridiculous pans and zooms seem right at home here when happening around Mike Lowrey. And the action is really solid. From the first time the villain cut up a dude I was on board. The fighting and the car chases just felt right which is probably the second most important thing about these movies. There was even some impressive stuff happening stunt wise even with the olds, like when Will jumped onto the awning to chase the bad guy and he runs so fucking fast he catches right up to him and grabs his legs. \n\nThe worst thing this movie does is get a little tropey at times. You've got bad guy who's king of conveying exposition through Google, you've got a plotline that revolves around one of those \"secret past\" situations where it's never been hinted at in three movies and now it's like the most important part of his life. It's definitely not perfect, but honestly, it's as good as it needs to be. Better, even. The good things about it heavily outweighed the tropey. Even the dumb things like seeing Reggie was marrying Short's daughter and he was still just this good kid, Michael Bay's cameo, mentioning group therapy, it all just made me feel very warm and fuzzy.\n\nThis is probably a light 7/10. Could go to a 6 if I don't like it as much next time around but right now I'm just happy the series got a solid installment and that some people still seem to care about what made Bad Boys great.\n\nEdit: sorry I'm an idiot, I am aware Martin Short is very different from Martin Lawrence.

Nora (Kristen Stewart) tries to do her best to stay calm >!but at once she reaches the old drill site she essentially breaks down, before bucking up, determined to stay alive.!< Jessica Henwick's character Emily does a good job of someone fraying at the seams, managing to just hold herself together >!and survives despite the movie making me think she wouldn't. Vincent Cassell's captain Sam is a little bland at times >!and makes what is easily the dumbest decision is the movie, going back for a bolt gun after rescuing someone a creature pulled away.!< But he manages to portray a fairly good Rock for the others to rely on. John Gallagher Jr plays Smith, who is in love with Emily and their relationship is quite believable, and a good friend of Nora's. He plays a guy way out of his wheelhouse but does the best he can to hold it together and helps other do the same. >!Unfortunately, hespends the latter half of the movie mostly unconscious due to oxygen deprivation.!<\n>!Mamoudou Athie's character is dead in the first fifteen minutes so barely remember his name.!< And TJ Miller is not a great addition to this movie. His sole role is comic relief and while he has some actually good lines, many fall flat >!and I was glad to seem him go around the hallway point.!< \n\nPlot wise they don't waste any time. The movies starts, Kristen Stewart monologues for a minute or two, and then the whole place falls apart. From their is almost non stop, with the exception of a few slower moments so the audience isn't overwhelmed, >!as they try to escape the main building an reach one over a mile away that is still intact.!< They don't waste time trying to figure and explain what happened, instead focusing on their survival. A few pieces of dialogue are bit clunky such as TJ Miller, and some story from Nora about her dead finance, but they are few enough that they don't drag it down too much.\n\nAs for the creatures, I both like and dislike them. They have a basic design of a humanoid upper body and some kind of jellyfish like lower body, although it's hard to tell as we only ever get a good solid look at their upper bodies. However their appearance is kinda bland to me. They are too similar to humans in my opinion, I would have preferred if they were more like deep sea creatures in design. And there are a couple of times were the CGI falls thru, although there is a decent amount of practical effect in this as well >!The Big One is seriously cool though. Again I'm biased since I love giant monsters, but even so the design is much better. While we don't see it's lower body almost at all, what see off its upper body is distinctly alien in design. Large tentacles on its back, multiple eyes, huge three part mouth covered in teeth, tentacle beard, and strange looking hands. The movie does a good job at hinting about it as they mention how the station is 70% compromised in minutes, or that a 6000 ton drill was uprooted with extreme force.!< \n\nOverall, while it is not redefining the genre or doing anything revolutionary, this is a very enjoyable movie. If you are a fan of Sci Fi monster movies like Alien, I would seriously recommend you give this movie a look.", "There's an excellent movie in here if they took an extra couple of minutes to expand on the company being a front for a cult and the captain looking to old gods to bring back his daughter", "Good thing they had a convenient 'melt down the core button'... that seems too easy. Also the read out to show the monsters chasing the pods and the blast radius, good thing they programmed that! Stewart's character was shown to be smart, able to hot wire stuff and rig up the other suit etc. then to just not use that at the end really seemed like a weird miss. Also black guy dies first? Come on! Edit: also was anyone else hoping the bunny paid off? Like they had to stuff in something to stop a fuel or air leak or something...", "One thing I\u2019ll say about this movie is... it\u2019s better than The Grudge so it has that going for it!", "If this movie just went a bit further and made Titan a front for a cult, and the captain a conflicted member. This thing would have come right together. Still a fun ride.", "Copy pasted from my previous post.\n\n\n\nI was pleasently surprised by the film.

All that said, I really liked it.", "Anybody else disappointed that Stewart's character didn't investigate the creepy drawings in the captains locker at Shepherd station? It looked like they could have added much more creepiness, but she just shrugs it off.", "Now knowing that this movie has some cultist undertones, I was wondering if anyone recalled the painting that was focused on while they are suiting up in their diving suits.  I'm assuming that it has some clues as to what is going on.", "The designers of this base must have had a lot of fore-thought when programming the reactor fail-safes.

There's something about the mood and atmosphere of them that I absolutely eat up.", "Man, I really cannot trust film critics anymore.\n\nExcellent little Alien/The Abyss inspired horror thriller with zero fat around/before the action (>!as in all the exposition is done by the end of the opening credits!<) which I can't say I would have expected to like but they did well enough when it came to character development during the run of the movie that it worked... \n\nWas pretty spooky, the CGI was obviously made easier by the darkness of being at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. >!The monsters definitely suffered from \"shown to be incredibly powerful but then is scared of like, a flashlight, or people looking at it, or whatever, until it's time to pick someone off then its fearless\" syndrome. And they even said it was attracted to the light, why would it avoid flashlight beams?!< I've definitely seen better monsters in movies, but they did the job and were at least a little freaky looking. Couple of the deaths were very good, dying underwater can be very gross.\n\nI don't know if it's just because I went in expecting way less or what but I thought it was very well acted. TJ Miller was trying his darndest, but wasn't that funny on the whole - but I still thought the movie did an excellent job portraying how people handle stress differently. Paul was a great portrayal of the type of person who automatically goes to gallows humor, Emily was the person who can't shut up about random topics because they need to talk to avoid their fear. \n\nBiggest positive about the film: the characters feel extremely real and don't make any dumb horror movie choices. They act like real people would in their situation in a way not many horror movies reach.\n\n\nI can't think of another Kristen Stewart movie I've seen since Twilight. She was much, much better in this and was given a much more relatable, human character to work with. I thought she was like an anti-actor, or like being possessed by the spirit of an especially boring brick wall before seeing Underwater. Which btw, dumb name. But I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys monster movies or people stuck somewhere where things are going wrong movies.

Personally it needs more mystery and struggles with madness before the final confrontation.\n\nStill, the movie was very enjoyable until the very end.", "Anyone notice the pentagrams on the map in the captain\u2019s old locker? Were they drilling to hell?", "The movie that filled the Dead Space in my heart. Honestly pretty fucking cool. Didn't overdo it with the monsters and the reveal at the end was fucking sick.", "Really enjoyed this movie.\n\nHas anyone read the script? I remember seeing some people shitting on it and mentioning a terrible twist.", "My stepson and I went to this last night.\n\nHonestly? I fucking loved this movie. It moves crazy fast, the characters in it are all pretty memorable, the creatures have cool designs, and it's an obvious love letter to Alien and Dead Space.", "This movie had a Cthulu and two girls in bikinis. B+", "Perfect 3 am movie to watch on a hot night drinking a cold soda and eating a stake", "So it sounds like there's universal agreement the end monster was Cthulhu? I was confused the entire movie as to why the monsters would have arms, legs, and opposable thumbs, yet be from the bottom of the ocean. The movie in no way was marketed, written, or executed as if it was dealing with cosmic beings. To me it makes it worth a second watch. \n\nAlso, was there a random octopus monster like halfway through after the captain gets dragged away? Kristin Stewart runs away from it and it's never seen again. That gave me the impression that there were many different types of undiscovered sea lifeforms down there, further taking me out of the Cthulhu mentality.", "Was that supposed to be Cthulhu?", "Didn't they say at the beginning that some 22 pods already made their way to the surface? Wouldn't those 22 folks be mentioned in the news as survivors? The ending credits just mentioned the 2 survivors.", "I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. It was difficult to orient myself within the movie, which added to the chaotic atmosphere the movie created. I wish I cared more about the characters, there was never anytime taken to develop the characters and I never felt invested in them.", "I enjoyed this movie, but it felt good when it could have been a lot better with just a small addition.\n\nWhen Norah stops at Shepherd Base (the abandoned rig) it would have been awesome if she had discovered some signs that the company knew what was down there. Some cult iconography and such, some evidence of legends. The way they lingered on the captain's locker was suggestive, but there wasn't really anything to see.\n\nI did have one big question though. Near the end, just before Norah makes it into the final base and we see the huge monster, there is an explosion that saves her. Where did that come from? Did the other girl do it? Or was it the monster shooting something at Norah? It seemed to come out of nowhere and wasn't ever mentioned after that.", "Great underwater monster movie. There aren\u2019t many of them and this one is worth a watch. Love how the movie starts right away, no setup, just jumps straight in. Great underwater suit and monster designs. It was a lot more claustrophobic than I thought it would be too.\n\nThe end credits song is so out of place and random though also the comic relief character didn\u2019t work...he too felt out of place at times.", "Overall I enjoyed it. Great costume, set, and creature design. Wish there was more world building. Also I wish they would have made it easier to tell which character was which when they had the suits on. Something as easy as everyone has a different color glowstick or different light emitting from their suit. Could have played into the creatures seeing the light too. I just think it would have made it easier to tell who was involved in some of the scenes. But overall, pretty solid.", "I found it surprisingly good ! Much better than expected.\n\nI was worried at the beginning with the shaky cam that the whole movie would be like that but thankfully no.\n\nActors were alright, I honestly don't get the Kristen Stewart hate bandwagon. She was pretty good. People still think it's \"cool\" to hate her for Twilight apparently.\n\nThe ending was unexpected, I thought everyone would die except the main character(Kristen) like all horror/thriller movies. That giant monster was particularly amazing. I really didn't expect that and I'm glad they didn't show it in the trailer !\n\nMaybe this movie sets things up for a sequel ? Because there's definitly still tons of questions and mysteries unanswered.\n\nI give it a 7/10. Good flick if you're fan of the genre.", "TJ Miller annoyed me a little (still funny) and it could have used more horror elements but overall I still enjoyed the movie!", "Really enjoyed this. I liked how the action starts straight away as the tension never really stopped. I actually felt like it was similar to the descent but underwater. \n\nThe creature design was great and along with how dark it was the creatures always seemed on the periphery so you couldn't catch a good glimpse of them. \n\nI thought the fact the film only hinted that the captain knew what was going on also helped. There was something about him that didn't sit right throughout and the film leaves it to your imagination. \n\nOverall really enjoyable and far better than I expected.

I swear every film i see him in he tends to be evil or have a nasty streak in some shape or form.\n\nAnyway, film was a bit so so, half the time couldn't hear what the cast were saying, and the camera work was all over the place. Not getting the Dead Space comparisons at all, though there were some brutal deaths here.\n\nKirsten Stewart seems to be a bit of an underrated actress, probably something to do with the public perception of her in the media, she was very good in this, bonus points for being in panties half the time.", "Good timing and pace, enjoyable but the low critic rating is warranted.\n\nThe movie felt more like a video game, it would have been a good Dead Space game with some stupid quick time events.  Monsters are just showing up in places they could not have gotten into or if they had would have been flooded with water, there are artificial scarcities and they go from point to point with a boss fight at the end.", "I liked this movie a lot, however, I felt like it had better potential to be a survival movie without the monsters. Sort of like an underwater version of Gravity. I loved the scene where the dudes helmet cracked and he imploded, I loved the suits and how they were traversing the ocean floor. Most of the suspense for me came from the possible malfunctions in their suits/plot elements related to the challenges of being that deep underwater, the creatures didn\u2019t really do much for me.

It's one of those movies you just wanna watch and not think about too much. Although, I kept thinking about Cthulhu when I saw the monster towards the end.

To be honest, I think it would have been a great pickup for Netflix.", "I've seen it a couple of times and really dug it. Wasn't perfect, it had flaws, but it was a serviceable movie. All that being said, I'd like to have a sit-down with Lucien to ask him some questions...", "I thought it was a pretty entertaining movie. Admittedly I don\u2019t typically gravitate towards monster flicks but had some spare time to see this one. I enjoyed the set pieces and the grit and grime in a facility that would certainly beg for perfection seeing as it was the edge of the world. A comment on corporate laziness I suppose. I thought TJ Miller was a good take on the comedic relief for such a movie and Kristen Stewart did well with what she was given. My only gripe plot-wise is the total lack of any other characters outside the main cast, in a place that should have plenty. I guess most were able to escape while she was blacked out from the first fall she took at the very beginning? Overall I agree with some of the prior commenters here; It had the potential to trend more towards a good character film but traded those moments in for action. 7/10", "Underwater white dementors with faces. Excellent creature design.", "Some thoughts:\n\nThe opening sequence goes *hard* in on Aliens-esque vibes. Her crew jacket. The hallways look like they were painted in late 70s/early 80s mall parking lot designs. The computer she has to reboot has the display and font feel of an upright arcade game. But then everything else later is beautifully modern..? Such a disconnect that just made all those nods seem more ham fisted.\n\nThis movie felt longer than its runtime.\n\nThere was a lot of good and a lot of mediocre. I wish it was distributed all in one section; Poor 1st act that gets better or vice versa, but as-is it kept ebbing and flowing between the two and ultimately suffers for it on the whole. \n\nT.J.

I have a thing for underwater horror, and this one hit all the right notes.  It's a lean, to the point movie, but in this genre, that's a good thing.  The characters didn't do anything stupid (arguable that bringing back the first creature wasn't dumb), the design was stellar (THOSE SUITS!!!), and the monster reveal at the end was awesome.

The setting and creature design is cool/fresh. I love creature films and I would\u2019ve loved if they showed different life at the bottom of the ocean besides the one thing Kirsten Stewart woke up next to her after SPOILER losing the captain. It might\u2019ve been cool to have a giant squid these creatures destroyed.\n\nI thought it might be a possibility a creature made it into the ship besides the one that got TJ Miller however not the case. Actually speaking on that how did a sizeable creature, enough to pull him out of his suit, get into the base? The water was flowing through a crack into the little section they had to swim through, those creatures were pretty big so strange they left it as soon as TJ Miller died they didn\u2019t really want to bother with the one in with them.\n\nAnyways I enjoyed it and I will always try to get to the creature feature movies so we have more of them in the future but it\u2019s a shame this didn\u2019t get the attention I feel it\u2019s worthy of.

Everything about it felt like something I would kill to see on the big screen... the CG wasn't laughably bad like I expected, the costumes looked incredible like something believable, the sets looked pretty real, and the underwater scenes looked like they were actually underwater in the dark, scary depths. The acting was... alright, but I dont think it needed to be anything A+.\n\n...but I just left feeling somewhat disappointed. It's like they people who made this movie glanced over an HP Lovecraft inspired piece of art and went \"Yeah, that's what's scary. Underwater monsters!\" Like, it feels painfully hollow compared to what I felt like it could've been. The thing that kills me is that there are even little moments here that suggested they were interested in making it more of an Eldritch related horror movie, rather than a generic hunted by scifi monster movie. \n\nThe locker room scene with the main character toward the end is a perfect example. Are we going to just so easily glance over A MAP WITH WEIRD ELDRITCH DRAWINGS THAT POINTS TO SOMETHING BIGGER? The captain clearly knew about the creature and there are other small details suggesting he was holding info from the group about big old sea boy. Why wasnt this the plot that was explored? The movie could do with more time delving into the weird and unsettling nature of these cool creatures they made, but right when it gets interesting it ends.\n\nAnd that ending... introducing Cthulu or Dagon or whatever original monster it is, in a seriously cool way, only to kill them like... ten minutes later? Uncool. Took the horrifying monster and made it, well, lame. Nothing \"scary\" about it. And that monologue was cringe beyond belief. \n\nImagine this: Our main character activates the self destruct feature in the base and sacrifices herself to nuke the big bad sea boy. The screen cuts to black just as it goes off and we see the two lovebirds who made it to the surface. They pop open their escape pods and hold each other, waiting to see their friend, excited they've survived... only her pod doesnt surface and instead we hear this loud, horrible scream come from below the waves. It shakes their pods and when they look down into the water, they see it rising.\n \nMaybe I'm wrong, but it feels like they took what they thought lovecraftian was supposed to be and made it into a movie, not really bothering to delve deeper into the psychological and otherworldly nature of the genre. It's like they were too afraid to get with the weird that would've made this movie way more fun and enjoyable. I didnt hate it, far from it. It felt like a first draft of something that could've been great, but chose to play it safe...ish.", "Question though, what was with Nora pushing on her sternum?", "That was surprisingly decent actually for a January horror.

Between this and Charlie's Angels, I hope that she gets more action roles, and better scripts to work with, because I think that she could be good at it.\n\nAlso she pulls off the short hair/shaved head look VERY well, it looks great on her.\n\nThe rest of the film was, decent.  Some good claustrophobic moments, the monster looked pretty good, the underwater setting works well, etc.  But the script was, meh, and there were some inconsistencies.\n\nI'd give it a \"B\" probably.  And it's better than most January horror films are, that's for sure.", "It was more like that movie \"Life\" than anything else, though I do see the Alien comparison being valid too. Ultimately I liked the movie, but I felt that some points kind of didn't mesh on a cinematography level.\n\nLike when Kristen Stewart has her \"all is lost moment\" alone and they play this super weird  out of place pop anthem, and then at the end during the climax they do the same....These two scenes are really important in any story circle so to break into some kind of weird music and a voice over and drop the  visual tone suddenly the way like they did kind of took me out of the moment.  \n\nIt's almost like they took the conspiracy theories around that \"bloop\" sound that happened underwater in real life and made a movie.  I am not sure why they dumped the movie in January, it could have stood in October around Halloween as well.\n\nOverall i give it 3 bags of popcorn and 2  sodas.", "First and foremost, I wasn't expecting too much for this film but within the first few minutes we go right to it. I for the most part was able to overlook some of the tech issues given the setting, though the set itself did give it that late 70's early 80's sci-fi feel, but it does match up with even the most 'modern' research and military vessels as far as interior.

Is there a lot of monsters in the film? I\u2019m a huge monster fan especially giant monsters.", "This movie reminded me a lot of Overlord. You know, it's like a smaller genre film and it basically follows our main character up close for the entire runtime and was probably not made for sequels. And that's all pretty rare these days, especially the last one, so I can appreciate it. I didn't think it was as good as Overlord, but it's certainly not laughably bad or anything. I was afraid it might get super dull but then a dudes head caved in and another turned to soup in his suit and I was like, yeah okay I'm in. \n\n\nThe setting was pretty neat. Walking the Mariana Trench floor felt both claustrophobic from the lack of light and also very wide open in the sense that danger could have come from anywhere. There were hints of Gravity, Alien, The Abyss, all sorts of stuff which isn't a bad thing. I wouldn't call it devastatingly original, but it was original enough that it wasn't making me roll my eyes or I never felt like they were copying something verbatim. \n\nIt did have some major issues. First of all, the movie starts right away. Within like five minutes shit is hitting the fan and it never really calms down after that. There's scenes where the characters are in a safe place but they're always moving forward and in danger. Which is kind of cool, but also really left me at a loss to understand some things. Why were they down there? What happened? Who are these people? Some of these questions are answered in throwaway lines here and there, but without any sort of introduction to the vessel or the characters it was hard to interpret the rest of the movie correctly. \n\n\nWasn't sure where they were or needed to go, how big the station was. I think it was revealed to be a drilling station which is nice and politically relevant, but without any background of what they're drilling or why it's kinda just like *shrug*. \n\nI know in the trailer there's like hints of a scene where TJ Miller puts on some music through the PA and everyone's getting ready to party, they either only shot that for the trailer or just totally cut it out. A curious choice to say the least, it may have been tropey but it might have been good to see everyone before they were in crisis mode. Like, there's a scene where they bring one of the creatures on board and it's dead and they're inspecting it and the Asian actress touches one of its thorns with her bare hand and I was getting Prometheus flashbacks. It didn't cause anything bad to happen, but I didn't know how to feel about it because I didn't know if she was competent at what she did, or even what she did for the station. \n\nAnyways, if you're a fan of some of the movies this reminds you of it's probably worth a go for you. This probably won't be anyone's favorite movie but it will join a line of suspenseful and claustrophobic movies that are just fine for a watch. I'd give it an even 6/10.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "After a long day of tending to the pigs and repairing the thatching of my favorite cottage - I found some time to visit the theatre district and see a performance of the show \"Underwater\"\n\nI'm exhausted though, and the roosters will be crowing soon enough, so let's dive into this knave's no-BS breakdown and final rating:\n\n**Storytelling:** A mixed bag. What I mean by this is that I've seen every *thriller* available at the local theatre these last 6 months, and this was - by far - a much more fleshed out story compared to some of the more recent offerings (ex: *Countdown*, *Black Christmas, The Grudge*). However, it suffers from a lack of character development, as well as convincing creature science. \n\nThe show thrusts you right into the problem from the opening scene, and does a decent job at keeping things moving throughout. I do want to be clear in stating that there's no new ground broken here - many that see this one will immediately draw connections to other stories like *Alien, 10,000 leagues under the sea, The Abyss, leviathon, The cave...etc* \\- you get the point, people do things that result in them being isolated in a difficult-to-navigate environment, and the only way out is through the problem so that they can *maybe* escape if everything goes right. This is a tried-and-true story we've seen and read (although I can't read) 1000 times before - however, its tried-and-true for a reason. In my opinion, monster stories that isolate characters and place them in unavoidable conflict are the absolute best type of sci-fi thriller/horror (Ex: *Jaws*, *The Thing*, *Alien*, *Jurassic Park*...etc), and this is trying to be a new entry into that club of films. It does not succeed however, and lands somewhere short of being memorable, but certainly re-watchable.\n\nSpeaking of characters, this is the weakest point of the story. This lad is a firm believer in that if you're going to have a movie centered around sci-fi monsters, at least include plenty of extras to be fodder in various gruesome ways. This wasn't a problem at first, as there was plenty going on, and people were dropping like flies for various reasons, but somewhere about halfway through - you start to see who has plot armor and who doesn't - and this quickly breaks the immersion as you realize some characters are immune to the grisly deaths that others quickly experienced.\n\nAs touched on above, none of the characters are fully developed or necessarily memorable. There's the funny guy from *deadpool* (T.J. Miller) playing a funny guy that says funny things, and then there's a woman that's a mechanical engineer and can open/hack any digital device around (Kristen Stewart), and then there's the captain (Vincent Cassel) - the only person that's actively trying to keep everyone alive - and then there's everyone else. I word it this way, because that's the extent of the development that takes place. There's some sidebar about Kristen Stewart having lost her fianc\u00e9 at some point in the past, the captain is also revealed to have suffered a loss of his daughter that is never really elaborated on, and then two of the other miscellaneous characters like each other, and T.J. Miller has a favorite plushie that he brings with him because that's his *quirk*. I'll spoil that the plushie is one of the only things that survives - and many people put in a lot of effort to make sure it does.\n\nI also want to briefly mention that the biology of the main threat is something I can't help but question. I've been told by wizards wise beyond their years - that any creature that's evolved within the aphotic zone - more than 7 miles down - will likely not rely on something like *eyesight* in order to catch its prey. instead, a creature would have much more powerful sensory abilities (i.e. the ability to detect heat signatures and sonar capability) versus needing light in order to hunt. Now, this aspect is never fully explored, and the director can certainly have the monster be and do whatever he wants, but there were *tense* scenes where characters - whom are standing on the ocean floor of the Mariana Trench (don't even get me started on the pressure/physics questions) - were scrambling to turn off their lights as monsters were searching for them, and it seemed to effectively keep them hidden and safe for some reason.\n\n**Direction:** William Eubank (*The Signal*) put out a decent attempt with the direction of the film. The camera work and editing (albeit predictable) are effective, and the *cool* color palette containing deep shades of blues and blacks is perfect for the setting of the story. The thing that really separates *good* from *great* in this genre is that most people are more afraid by what they don't see versus what they do see. Many stories of this nature have been ruined by giving the main threat too much visibility on screen, as things tend to be less scary when the monster is fully in view. This film wasn't *ruined* per se, but I think most would agree that less is more within this type of genre, and this movie in particular would have benefited from keeping us in the dark more than it did; something that would have been easy enough to do. The scope of the threat becomes crystal clear eventually, and while it does reach a Cthulhu level of hopelessness during the final act - it wasn't necessary to show as much as Eubank opted to, and it would have likely been more interesting and eerie had the threat remained in the shadows, but ever-present\n\n**Pacing:** No complaints. The movie kicks off with a bang (literally), and things pretty much don't stop from there. Some of the characters could have been more developed, but that horse has been kicked to death above.\n\n**Acting:** The Acting was pretty good. There were some silly exchanges at various points throughout \"Ex: I like anime too!\", but the actors and actresses all did fine. This was never an issue for me.\n\n**Sound:** The sound was good. There were some *gimmicky* loud moments to draw out jump scares at times, but I do remember thinking about halfway through that the overall score was surprisingly above par for this type of film. It almost had a *spacey* retro synth vibe to it at times, but then a slow ethereal feel at others. Definitely worth a listen if you enjoy atmospheric soundtrack music.\n\n\\--\n\n**Final Verdict:** 6.5/10\n\nRealistically this was an enjoyable film that isn't far from being a *great* film. The cast showed up, and they did the best with the material they were given, but had there been some changes to the lack of character development, some of the creature effects/ambiguity, and a little less plot predictability - this very easily could have been a B+/A- film. I do think it's worth noting that Fox has been sitting on this completed project for two years, and that in a lot of ways it felt like Disney acquired this movie and simply didn't know what to do with it - so they decided \"let's just throw it out in January and get rid of it\". It's a suprisingly high-production release for this time of year. There are also some genuinely grisly/terrifying moments in this movie - ironically none i'm referring to involve the monsters - but the opening sequence especially will be enough to make many people pass on ever staying in an underwater facility. \n\nIf you thoroughly enjoy *Deep Blue Sea* and *Anacanda* \\- this will likely be fun for you. If you're looking for the next *Abyss or Alien* though - this is not quite on that level of craftsmanship.\n\nBut I'm just a peasant. What do I know?", "I enjoyed this movie. 7/10 for me. I was honestly really surprised that T.J. Miller went out so early and John Gallagher Jr ends up surviving. It almost felt like they let Gallagher survive because he\u2019s a smaller guy and the two ladies couldn\u2019t have dragged Miller around?  Kristen Steward was awesome, honestly an underrated actress.

The only laughs it got from me was a joke about Caillou and Billy Porter's dramatic exit in a scene. The rest of the joke are really unfunny and forced.\n\nJust really predictable and poorly scripted.

It's a comedy released in January, it knows what it is, and there's enough fun make it worth its time. And it doesn't overstay its welcome. I know that's a low bar, but it's far from a terrible movie. \n\nAll of the main cast members, especially Billy Porter and Salma Hayek, look like they're having a blast. \n\nAlso they drag Caillou, so it has that going for it.\n\nI will say it seems like they just slashed this movie in editing, because a lot of the jokes in the trailer aren't in the movie itself and you can tell they cut some things short.", "This lad went into the production of *Like a boss* with zero expectations, with as open a mind as a working man can have, and a bag of the finest buttered cornhusks.\n\nHere's my no BS review:\n\n**Storytelling:** At its core *Like a Boss* wants to deliver a good message to women. The premise being: two women - that have been friends forever - have been in a cosmetics business together for a while. They strive to *accent* the beauty that each woman already possesses - without making women believe that they need to cake on a bunch of makeup to feel beautiful and empowered. The idea is a serious topic that needs to be addressed, especially in a time when vanity and negative self-image are at an all-time high, but outside of this single touching sentiment that they barely scratch the surface of exploring - the rest of the story felt like a screenplay created by a bunch of teenagers during a Saturday afternoon in detention.\n\nEvery single scene - from start to finish - felt like the mindset going into the scene was to be as crass and over-the-top as possible - and almost every joke fell short of being humorous. There were two moments that made this lad chuckle, one of them involving an obscure pokemon reference, and the other due to a reaction (facial expression) from *Rose Byrne*.\n\nFor example, there was one scene where the lead women (*Byrne* and *Haddish)* are smoking *the devil's lettuce* in an empty room of the second-story of their friend's house in the middle of a baby shower, and they see that there's a crib with a baby in the room while they're smoking. In the process of putting the joint out, they drop it in the crib, laugh out how the baby looks like its smoking the joint, and take some pictures with their phones. When they go to leave the room to head back to the party, they hear people coming upstairs, so they freak out and climb out of the window of the room instead, and then when confronted by their friends (who aren't even mad about what has happened) they jump off the roof into a swimming pool to escape and run away.\n\nThis is the level of *comedy* that each scene offers - just some include more penis and vagina references.\n\n**Direction:** As I touched on above, it really felt like *Miguel Arteta* sat in a *Starbucks* on the day of shooting and tried to quickly write the screenplay on the back of a napkin - going scene to scene for 30 minutes - before crumpling that napkin up and deciding he would just \"wing it\" when he got to the set. On the way to the set, he probably called his niece or nephew, and asked them what the kids were laughing at these days, and then used that response as the blueprint to the structure of his storyboard.\n\n**Pacing:** Not really an issue here. There is a *montage* scene near the end that feels clich\u00e9, but the story progresses appropriately throughout.\n\n**Acting:** *Rose Byrne* did a fine job with the material she was given, and I'd like to say the same about *Tiffany Haddish*, but I really didn't find her to be convincing in this role. To me, it felt as though she were reading from a prompt in many moments, and there were even some places where she looked directly at the camera that I was surprised weren't cut out during editing. *Salma Hayek* seemed like she had fun with the role of a villainous cut-throat business woman, but her character was almost caricature-like in its writing, as she played a strong business woman that wanted to \"*collaborate\"* with the smaller business of *Byrne* and *Haddish*, while also conniving to destroy their friendship and steal their idea in the background. *Billy Porter* was an enjoyable presence when he was one screen, but he was briefly around, and *Jennifer Coolidge* has kind of gotten what I would coin as a \"*Rebel Wilson\"* treatment here, as she plays a \"ditzy\" hopeless romantic that's reduced to crass one-liners about her vagina any time she's in a scene. *Karan Soni* was also in a number of scenes, and while he didn't say much, he did add some genuine levity through body language and facial expression.\n\n**Sound:** As expected with a production like this, it predominantly relies on music from popular culture versus an original score.\n\n\\--\n\n**Final Verdict:** 4/10\n\nMake no mistake, this film had the cast needed to make a genuinely funny movie, but the writing was  unfortunately absolute shite. Some of the acting from *Haddish* also felt unconvincing, but with a script this shallow, it's not hard to understand how an actor might not live and breathe the role they're asked to portray. To be clear, a 4/10 doesn't mean that It's a completely unwatchable production. There will be those that find the comedy just passable enough to acceptable, but I do feel that *Like a Boss* is the laziest film of 2020 so far - even when compared to other unanimously underwhelming productions like *The Grudge* and *Underwater.*\n\nBut I'm just a peasant.

Jordan and Jamie Foxx killed it but I loved the supporting cast of Rob Morgan, Tim Blake Nelson (who IMO stole the entire show) and O'Shea Jackson.\n\n\nThe entire scene where Herbert is going to the chair was so damn good an I thought it was the best scene in the film by far.\n\n\nI think my only main complaint would be that it takes its time setting a lot of stuff and goes about it in a more slow manner and then the end felt like they realized they want a shorter runtime so cut it down and did the time jump and it just felt very sudden.\n\n\nStill, a really good film and probably about an 8/10", "Tim Blake Nelson continues to prove he's one of the best fucking actors out there", "I just left a pretty full (small) theater showing a mid-afternoon showing of the movie. A couple of people clapped at the dismissal. \n\nI was crying from about a third of the way in all the way to the end. It wasn\u2019t fabulous, but I thought it was a solid B+, really well acted, and the fact that it was really true, not just \u201cinspired by\u201d sealed the deal for me. \n\nThe end cards with the updates made me so angry I could spit. Not only did Johnnie D get early onset dementia within a handful of years of his release, that damn sheriff was re-elected over and over until just last year, AND the true killer of that poor girl was never pursued!\n\nThey literally cared more about punishing him for \u201cmessing around with a white woman\u201d than solving a teenager\u2019s murder. \n\nI...I\u2019m just at a loss. How do you even talk about that reasonably?\n\nAnd that\u2019s not even addressing the injustice of the death penalty generally. \n\n\nAs for the filmmaking, I thought it was well done. Really good acting, as I said, and I did feel like I got to know Herb, Johnnie D, Ray, Brian, and the Brie Larson character. Was it a bit predictable? Sure, but how else would a judge called Robert E. Lee Whatever behave? How else would the cops under that sheriff behave? \n\nBrian Stevenson was naive, but had to toughen up quick. I actually felt his underlying rage a lot of the time. Maybe it\u2019s because I have Black male relatives who are like him: super idealistic and confident, but sort of worn down by having to deal with bullshit that makes them okay in expressing their full personalities only when they feel really comfortable with you. I am not expressing it well, but I could see him sort of close down over the course of the movie, and boy, did I recognize that. :(", "Overall it was a decent film. It was very focused on what it was trying to say and didn't fall into the trap of emotionally manipulating the audience too heavily. I do wish there was a little bit more development of Jordan's character and the DA character. The latter in particular took a big career/social risk by joining the motion to dismiss the charges against Foxx's character, and it would have been nice if that had been explicitly explored a little more either before or after the fact.", "The whole execution sequence with Herbert was very powerful and very moving. I'm not sure what I've seen Rob Morgan in outside of Netflix Marvel stuff, but he is an incredible actor.", "From the very first scene with Herbert, I knew his character would be the most emotionally affecting for me.  I appreciate the movie shining even a small light on mental illness, especially involving a veteran who has been through hell.  Anyway, there was a solid 10-to-15-minute stretch of the movie involving Herbert's character that had me either full-on crying or at least teary eyed at any given moment.  People in this thread seem to have known the actor before seeing the movie, yet as someone who didn't know him, I was impressed with his performance.  He made the most out of what is basically a side character.\n\nI also just want to note that I appreciate the movie maintained a mostly low-key, serious tone throughout.  The actors were restrained and didn't chew scenery in an Oscar bait-y manner.  And the occassional light-hearted moment felt genuine (and even necessary), not forced.\n\nAs someone that didn't know anything about the true story beforehand, the movie definitely had me for a moment when Ralph Myers acted like he was confused during his witness testimony in court.  It's crazy to think things like that have happened in real life due to fear and pressure from authority figures.   After that moment, I'm glad things played out as they did.  \n\nOverall, I feel that Just Mercy is a *good* movie with some great elements.", "I just wanted to comment that I was born and raised in Monroe County. I know/knew almost every person involved with this case, including seeing Ronda the night before she was murdered. I am a huge fan of Bryan and give him the upmost respect. My biggest interest in seeing the movie was how everyone would be portrayed, what would be left out and the reaction of the audience. I could write a book about how I feel about it all but I won\u2019t complicate the thread with all of that.\nI was very disappointed that so little information about Ronda was given and they needed to use another persons photo to represent her. It was almost as if the movie had nothing to do with her and she was just considered \u201canother privileged white girl\u201d. I truly believe that every person is equal an should have equal rights. I believe everyone deserves the same rights and privilege that has been afforded to me. \nI was amazed at how most of the actors truly represented the actual people with the one exception of Fox. I don\u2019t believe that was the fault of Fox but because the majority of these people never had the opportunity to know Johnny D before his incarceration with the exception of those in and around Monroe County. The Johnny D I was familiar with was very different that Fox\u2019s character.\nJohnny D wasn\u2019t a random unknown black man in Monroe County. He was very familiar to the people there either personally or by reputation and I think that is important to remember.\nWith all that said, regardless of my personal knowledge of the case, Johnny D did not get a fair trial and I believe that was a horrible injustice. That kind of injustice would have broken Ronda\u2019s heart even if he was the one that killed her. She believed in being fair. \nIn the end, that was my biggest take away. Ronda would have been so thrilled and honored that something good came from her death.....one step in making this world more just and a better place.", "Honestly this movie was just so powerful. It was the kick in the pants I needed to get back to LSAT studying that I had been putting off!", "The story was incredibly gripping and helped share a story about a person I didn\u2019t know before. Now, I\u2019ll know who Bryan Stevenson is and the EJI. It should really be a story that is shared with others right alongside other social justice heroes. We do really need to focus on people like him because it helps demystify the idea that Civil Rights ended in the 60s. It was striking to see that the trial happened around April 1992. A part of me wonder why people tend to stick around areas of intense racism rather than fleeing to more progressive towns. However, April 1992 informs of Rodney King and the brutal riots that followed which is a reminder Racism, injustice, and police brutality happen everywhere.\n\nThe actual movie was just okay for me. I thought Jamie Foxx was outstanding and showed why he is a high caliber actor. Something about Michael B. Jordan\u2019s performance was a bit flat to me. It could have been the dialogue, but Jordan just didn\u2019t have the same energy and charisma that I am use to with him. While Brie Larson was fine, she didn\u2019t seem to have much to do. All of the prisoners were solid. Either way, it was a great story but an alright movie. It\u2019s good material to show a high school class.", "Was anyone else\u2019s theater also super empty? Not what I expected in manhattan", "Two scenes that really hit me emotionally were when, Walter sees Bryan for the second time and is shocked and thankful that he had seen his family. It just shows how much Bryan genuinely cared about Walter, while the other lawyers did not. The other scene being when Herb was to be put to death. He has a dialogue in this scene in which he states that this day is marks the first time that people have asked him what he needs. This is so sad and troubling to even think about. The only thing that made people give a shit about him is because he was going to die. \n\nIn addition to these something else that I really loved was the character development of the cop that asks Bryan to strip at the beginning. While Herbs death scene is happening somebody says that after seeing the is it will change the person who you are. And it\u2019s exactly what happened to him. He started being much nicer and more understanding for Walter and others.", "Holy crap, it was painful to watch because I feel so angry at a lot of the scenes and wish I could have done something right then and there but I know at least it's fictional to the actors but damn it's based on a true story and just fuck \n\nAnyway it clawed a sob out of me and several other audience members 10/10 I wouldn't rewatch because I'd be too damn angry once the sadness factor wears off but fuck it was good.\n\nCinema was fully packed (likely because we all got in there with an advanced preview free tix) and damn that was great. I love a packed cinema lol too bad pal I asked to come with me as my plus one since I got an admission for two ended up cancelling on me last minute due to something at home happened rip\n\nBut I also haven't watched a film on my own in a while so it felt rather nice too to not have to entertain someone whoo! :)", "There\u2019s not a *better* actor alive than Tim Blake Nelson. Full stop. \n\nIt reminded me of how Paul Walter Hauser and Mahershala Ali talked about how for their roles in Richard Jewell and Green Book they chose to alter the voice of the real person because they thought it would be distracting/cartoony. Problems with both movies aside, I think those are great performances by great actors, but I love that Tim Blake Nelson doesn\u2019t give a fuck and leans into the cliche of the way Meyers talked and moved and crushes it. The guy on YouTube who breaks down accents talks about how sometimes it\u2019s not fully integrated, but here, Nelson is fully integrated with the accent and the body and the soul. Just an astonishingly good performance.\n\nOtherwise... it\u2019s powerful if you sink into it, just loaded in cliche and (understandable and justified) affection for Stevenson. \n\nThe script is weak. Yes, people like those lawyers definitely do talk like that, but you have to give us a feeling of real conversation rather than just dropping in on the big speechifying moments.\n\n\nShort Term 12 is my favorite film of the last decade. This isn\u2019t close to that, but Cretton has real empathy and that gets across here. As others said, the execution is powerfully staged and prompted a lot of crying in my theater.", "The movie was really good. I didn't know anything about it and just bought the ticket because it seemed like the only decent movie being screened at the time. I really liked how they showed several former racists and white people changing sides (the prosecutor, the jail guard and several white members in the organisation later). I don't know much about racism in 70s America and this was a really nice movie to give a perspective.\nSadly the theatre was all empty, I was the only one watching this movie while other stupid movies were all full.", "Just watched this and loved it. I wish the people who refuse to believe that there is still injustice towards black people would watch this movie. It's been released to be seen for free, but I'm afraid that the people who really need to see it will turn a blind eye. Regardless, incredibly eye-opening for anyone who watches it", "My theater wasn\u2019t too packed, but by the middle of the movie 7 people had walked out. \n\nI have minor complaints about the movie (pacing was off, the volume was too low..but that\u2019s more of the theater than the movie) but overall, solid film. \n\nI cried for Herbert and for John (Walter\u2019s son). I loved how the whole family and community was there in that house, it reminded me of how my family used to get together like that. \n\nI only know Tim Blake Nelson from O Brother Where Art Thou, but second I saw him I was like, \u201cyeah this is a good film\u201d \n\nSeemed more like a Movie of the Week tbh but I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the conversation I had with the people after the movie ended\n\nAlso, does anyone know what song the first inmate was singing? It was beautiful", "My theater was packed and I've never seen so many black men openly crying in my life. My dad never cries and cried during this film. The whole time I was watching the movie I kept thinking my dad was 27 when all this went down and this could have easily been him. He was just fortunate enough not live there.", "Really powerful film that hits harder right now, but will be effective for years to come. I thought some of the dialogue felt a little unnatural for the sake of exposition (particularly some of the scenes towards the beginning with Bryan and Eva researching the cases), but that\u2019s a minor nitpick. Solid 8.5/10 for me. \n\nOne thing I haven\u2019t seen mentioned after browsing this thread is the subtle redemption story of the prison guard (the one who forces Bryan to strip down when he first comes to the prison - I don\u2019t think we get his name). He doesn\u2019t get many lines after that, but shows up a few more times and the camera seems to focus on his face as if to show his internal struggle with the injustice going on around him - most notably in the Herb execution scene. I could be reading too much into it, but I thought that was a nice way of hinting at the power of the institutional racism on this cop, without letting him off the hook by giving him a blatant \u201che\u2019s actually nice\u201d scene.", "Got to see this at a screening at Warner Brothers last night. It's a tale of two movies. One is meh and the other is tremendous.\n\nThere are pacing problems and issues with the dialogue rhythm/volume in the first half, but the second act solves most of those, picks up and gets out of the way of an incredible story. \n\nBryan Stevenson is a name every American should know and MBJ has done an admirable job representing his soft spoken conviction. He is an american treasure that gets too little admiration and attention. And Foxx is so good in a role that could lend itself to melodrama and parody. Their is this feeling the whole movie that Melodrama is just around the corner, but it pulls back just in time, which is hard to do with such an emotionally charged story.\n\nDidn't feel like a Best Picture nomination but it's an important film, a vital story worth making time for.\n\nAfter you watch it (or before, if you want to get up to speed on the case and aren't worried about spoilers) this is Ed Bradley's 60 Minutes story. Shows how faithful the portrayal of the story was. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shzMjyuijRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shzMjyuijRU)", "What an amazing film, honestly. I know it hasn't received the most attention from the awards circuit, but I believe Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Foxx and Brie Larson deserve far more love for their performances. All very understated and well done. Even the screenplay was deserving of at least some nominations. Not the best picture of the year, but absolutely one of the top.", "this movie is free on google play right now.

None of the performances were that memorable and the movie kind of just went along and checked off all the boxes without any powerful performances by anyone. It told the story it wanted to tell but it just felt like it was missing something.", "Just saw this and wow it was so movie what a story it really makes you think, this and Dark Waters were very good all these films bases on a true story have been really good this year", "Watching this movie with the Black Lives Matter movement in mind added so many more dimension and layers to this performance.\n\nMy god, the suppressed rage that must be so tiring to have to burden yourself with. Every unjust sneer and power-tripping snarl that the cops and judges gave, it just ate at me. I thought the feeling of powerlessness was really well portrayed by the prisoners, especially during the electric chair scenes and when they overturned the request for a retrial.\n\nThis move will stick with me for a long time. Especially knowing that the sheriff was still in charge until LAST YEAR.", "At the end of the video, I learned that Tate remained sheriff just until last year, and reelected 6 times. \n\nSeeing this cinematic experience, I can't believe justice never reached him. Makes me feel awful living in this country, knowing people can still retain power after so much evident evil.", "I saw this yesterday and I'm a little confused by the release strategy. I think it could have gotten some serious awards consideration for the performances, though supporting actor is a tough category to crack this year. And if you're not pushing for the awards then why not hold off on the wide release a bit and not open against 1917?\n\nWhat I liked: The supporting performances are all really good. Jamie Foxx is getting most of the (well-deserved) acclaim, but Tim Blake Nelson is incredible and Brie Larson, Rob Morgan, and O'Shea Jackson Jr are very good. It's a movie with great moments. I've watched 102 2019 releases in theaters and with the possible exception of a certain scene in Jojo Rabbit nothing has produced the in theater reaction that the execution scene in this did. And on the other end of the spectrum, I think only a certain scene in Endgame garnered the cheering that the final reading of the verdict did. Finally I just think this is a great, important story that people should know. I knew about some of the work being done to overturn death row convictions, and I even remembered when Anthony Ray Hinton was released, but I didn't even know the name Bryan Stevenson.\n\nWhat I didn't like: I don't think Michael B Jordan is at his best in this movie, though to some degree that may be the script, which I think is kinda bad. There's quite a bit of bad dialogue, and the movie isn't paced particularly well, especially in the second half. Also I try not to be the \"the trailers ruined the movie\" guy, but the trailers showing the son's outburst in court kinda ruined the gutpunch that scene is supposed to be. EDIT: I initially thought this was just a problem with my theater, but I'm noticing a few other responses in here noting it, the volume of the dialogue in the first half was off a few times. There were a handful of lines that I missed because of the volume.\n\nIn general I think the great moments mostly make up for the parts that aren't as strong.  It's a 4/5 for me, and is definitely worth checking out, especially if you're unfamiliar with the story.", "Solid movie. Not without its fair share of flaws, but I liked it quite a bit nonetheless.\n\nSuper disappointing (although also kinda fun) that I had the entire theater to myself just 4 days after release in a metro area of nearly 1 million people, though.", "I liked it, but everything becomes a bit cliche near the end. It may have been helpful if the movie focused a bit more on what happened between later appearances in court. I was really interested in seeing the community's reaction or even the murdered woman's family. There's a lot if time skipping, so people just know info that the audience just learned, which is a bit annoying. I was already planning on reading the novel, but I was hoping to also see everything in the film.", "This movie has all the ingredients to be great, but it comes up just shy. The story is great, there are a handful of powerful moments, and it is just so inspiring, but it is lacking in a couple key areas. I don't think the direction and editing were very strong. It was paced a tad too slowly. The editing didn't add any energy, and the lack of a score made the quiet moments feel a little too long. I also think the movie peaked during the first attempt for a re-trial, and while the second attempt was also good, it was tough to regain the same emotional catharsis that the first attempt was building. The acting was also really good. Foxx is very good. Reminds you why he is one of the best of his generation. Tim Blake Nelson takes a potential stereotype and gives him some heart. Michael B. Jordan however is just fine. I feel like the film could have used a little more power in the lead. Like a young Denzel. Jordan goes a for a smouldering calm which just doesn't jump off the screen. He's fine, but not great. Worth a watch, but could have been so much more.", "I ugly cried at the end of this movie. 3 great performances from Jamie Foxx, Michael B. Jordan and Tim Blake Nelson.", "It should've been a lot better given the talent involved but it was still decent enough. 3 stars.\n\nI thought Tim Blake Nelson stole every scene he was in.", "Just Mercy - really strong film. Surprisingly great performance by Tim Blake Nelson, while Michael B Jordan, Jamie Foxx, and Brie Larson all top notch. 92/100", "Best movie of the year for me.\nIt made me go through a large range of emotions.\n\nI was sad, angry, disgusted, disappointed, happy...I cried like a baby for Herbert.\n\nAs a Canadian this made me realize how lucky we are here. (Although you can still find injustice in our justice system sometime, nothing like that)", "Was waiting for this and 1917 in Dec (I really hate limited releases, since they rarely get played in my area)..in anycase, fantastic acting by everyone. Jamie, MBJ, Brie, Cube Jr, etc. all did great in their roles. I was very uneasy/uncomfortable during that electric chair scene. I really felt for Herbert. I was angry and frustrated at the first hearing, when the Judge denied their case, when Stevenson had some pretty solid evidence that the DA's case was full of BS and lies. When we get to the final hearing, I was in bated breath after Stevenson's speech to the Judge. When the DA conceded and joined in dropping the charges, I signed with relief, an innocent man is freed. I liked how the final scenes showed the real people and a few follow ups, it's crazy to think Ray Hinton was just only released 5 years ago. Overall, fantastic movie and superb acting", "Shockingly, I thought the worst part of this was Michael B. He was just kinda fine. Still in the upper third of 2019 movies for me probably.", "This was incredible. Cried multiple times. So many powerful moments. It\u2019s crazy how messed up this world is. The scene of the execution midway through the movie will stick with me forever. That was powerful. \n\nFoxx was great, MBJ was good, Larson was good, but honestly performances in this weren't that important. The story was what drove this. This fell just outside my top 10 for 2019 and I think it's something everybody should see!", "I enjoyed the movie. I had read some reviews that it was emotionally manipulative, so I was cognizant of that going in. But honestly, I never really noticed it until the last scene of the movie. And even that wasn\u2019t totally over the top. \n\nThe acting was great. Jamie Fox, Tim Blake Nelson and Rob Morgan. Jordan\u2019s character felt a bit stiff at times, but maybe that\u2019s what they were going for. \n\nThe story was fantastic. Richardson\u2019s execution scene was enthralling and dramatic cinema. But the script itself was very formulaic.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do know?\u201d ... \u201cWe wait.\u201d\n\nHad to roll my eyes at that. Overall, a very solid movie. 7/10.\n\nEdit: The one real complaint I have with the movie is that they made a point of developing the one prison guard from stereotypical southern racist law enforcement official to someone clearly juggling the morality of his job and his actions. But then they don\u2019t develop it any further than that. Didn\u2019t really get the point of that. Maybe that was the films way of giving a nod to the fact that not all white law enforcement officers are mindless and racist?", "Do people literally get released immediately?  I don't understand why anyone would go back to prison and pack up", "Damn. This is my first legal drama. Feels a lot like To Kill A Mockingbird as a movie. >!That electrocution scene felt very Christ-like!<. What's the banging objects against bars called? Is there a name for it? I'm guessing it's a religious thing. Church and religion do show up a lot. First court scene was pretty intense. 2nd one felt anticlimactic but \"works\".

People who go in expecting a Stalingrad/Saving Private Ryan grand narrative are missing the point. \n\nThis film captures a very small slice of an unimaginably complex war from the perspective of 2 grunts on a mission. These guys aren't special forces soldiers or an elite landing party, they're expendable message couriers told only what they need to know and forced to improvise and adapt to a battlefield where the fog of war covers everything and everyone. The vast majority of characters in this movie are busy doing their own thing, contributing to their own seperate slice of the greater effort, and as far as they're concerned the leads are just random dudes.  \n\nUnlike a lot of other \"war is hell\" films, I don't get the feeling that 1917 was glorifying its subject in spite of the message. In the end the MC >!loses his friend!<, almost dies countless times, is verbally abused by the man who he was trying to help, all so he could stop an attack for a day that may or may not commence next morning.

I just can't help thinking that even tho this is just a movie made up of producers, sets, lights, and actors that this was set in a time that most of us alive on the planet don't and can't understand. A time where humans killed other humans by the 100 of thousands on orders of men that only wanted to serve their own goals. The movie made me feel for the families that lost sons and daughters who laid down their lives so that we could go on>!(not so dissimilar to how tom died)!<. Truly a spectacular feat in cinematography history in my opinion.", "This movie was incredible. I was really skeptical of seeing the movie for some reason. I think it was because I wasn't familiar with McKay and Chapman as leads and all the big names were cameo roles. But I was way wrong. The sequence with them going through No Man's Land. Holy shit. Running around in the village Ecoust, had to Wikipedia that, at night time? It was like walking around in a post apocalyptic world. Like Schofield was in hell. \n\nThe tension just kept building and building. When they were at the farmhouse it felt like I was in the middle of a horror movie and I was waiting for a German soldier to just pop out from behind a corner. Instead he came from the sky. The second they pulled him out of the plane, I could feel a sense of doom building up in me. I don't know what Blake was thinking trying to save that German soldier, like what were they going to do with him? Tie him up and take him along on the trip. I had a feeling Blake would die since he wasn't in the trailer nearly as much as Schofield. I didn't expect it to happen so early in the film. You don't realize, at least I didn't, that Blake's wound was fatal. Broke my damn heart.\n\nLoved the final sequence with Schofield trying to get to Colonel Mackenzie. It feels like he runs through a 10 mile trench trying to find him as the battle is just beginning. It was a weird comedic moment where Mackenzie, after Schofield saves his life by making him read the letter and withdrawing the attack, tells him to fuck off. He's almost disappointed he didn't get massacred.\n\nJust an incredible film.

The score, cinematography, everything was excellent from start to finish. Everyone saying to see it in the biggest, loudest theater you can is absolutely correct. \n\nAm I the only one who thought Schofield was a Christ metaphor?

He jumps into the river(baptism), then saves hundreds of lives by delivering the message.", "The best moment of the film by far was Schofield crying after he gets out of the river. He was never able to mourn his friend, he nearly died to the sniper, he was chased by multiple Germans, and he had to climb over those civilians in the river.

LOL.", "A lot will be said about the cinematography, and with good reason it's absolutely incredible; however, the score is every bit as good. It's harrowing, it's epic, it's terrifying at times.

I don\u2019t know how you pull off that one shot trick across two different trenches. \n\nReally incredible. \n\nI thought both main characters were going to have plot armor throughout the film and then they removed that quickly. \n\nThis movie feels like it\u2019s going to stick with me.", "A lot of comments on here praising the night scene for the direction and lighting, and for sure it was incredible, almost otherworldly, but for my money I'm taking the final sequence of Schofield looking for Mackenzie as the best scene of the film. One of the most brilliant and compelling depictions of the implacable war machine in action. Gives a feeling of futility for one one man to try to stop the wheels once they're in motion. The hopelessness of trying to hold back the roiling waters with your finger in the dike.\n\nAnd then it all culminates in him rushing alongside the trench through a hail of shells and bullets to save the lives of men currently racing past him to their deaths. Just magnificent.", "Just got out and not only do I think it\u2019s the best movie of 2019. I think it\u2019s one of the best movies I\u2019ve ever seen period. I\u2019m just in awe. \n\nIt deserves every technical award imaginable. I have no idea how they pulled this off.\n\nGreat performance, great score, great choreography, great cinematography. The scene of Schofield running across the front line to get to Colonel MacKenzie gave me chills down my entire spine the entire time.\n\nAbsolutely phenomenal.", "Lesson of the movie: Never trust a Jerry.", "I thought it was a really nice touch having the protagonist not have any personal to the plot. He didn't even want to go. He couldn't care less about medals and the only family he has is waiting for him at home. But when his best friend dies in his arms it's like he had no choice. It was really heartbreaking", "Astonishing piece of filmmaking. See it on the biggest goddamn screen you can find.", "As is no surprise to anybody, this movie is really amazing. It's technically brilliant, well acted, a great story, the music was incredible and used so tastefully, really it's got a lot going for it. \n\nOne-shot movies are interesting. Sometimes I'm not sure how the format is anything more than a challenge for everyone involved. It's incredibly impressive, but whether or not it's well done or lends itself to the narrative can be another story. Here, though, it works so well. It's like you're taking a tour of another time, walking through horrors we haven't even seen in photographs. \n\nFirst thing I noticed was that the movie moves so well that it's just never boring, despite following the same character with few obvious cuts. The setting would change in seconds, the background felt very alive or very dead depending on what was needed, and we still got great side character performances.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting. I mean it's basically Dora the Explorer does WWI. The plot is basically, go through the war zone, through the enemy trenches, towards the coast and through an occupied town. There's more to it than that, but reminding us where we were going and laying it out like that really helped ground us.\n\nThis movies greatest strengths, I think, are its depictions of war. From the beginning where the guy cut his hand then accidentally put it through a corpse's wound hole I was like oh fuck we are really in for something. Dead animals, burnt bodies, climbing over floating bodies, trench claustrophobia, it's all really well done and a lot of it isn't even the focus. It's just there and we're just walking through it. \n\nI couldn't believe the guy with the brother died. What a heartbreaking scene. Knowing that once he knew his brother was involved he couldn't stop going, knowing that he just wanted his mom to know he wasn't scared and alone. That scene caught my by surprise, up until then I had perceived him as the main character. \n\nWhat really ties the room together is the ending. He makes it, he delivers the message, but that doesn't mean the war is over or these men won't die at some point. But he did it because it was ordered of him and because he promised his friend. He didn't care about medals, he had a higher honor. And the at the very end when he pulls out the photo and on the back it says \"come back to us\" you realize he was on a larger mission this whole time. Absolutely devastated me. This was just one day in his service. \n\n9/10. I thought Dunkirk would be the best war movie in a long time, but this one's gonna be really hard to beat. Sam Mendes deserves every best directing award he gets this season 10 times over.\n\n/r/reviewsbyboner", "Don\u2019t have words.

I know there were some \"obvious\" cuts (like when it would focus on a rock or a tree would obstruct the view of the characters) but what a goddamn achievement of filmmaking to make this happen.  I was honestly impressed, especially those long walking scenes with a full conversation in the trenches.\n\nThe movie is a lot like Dunkirk in that it's just constant tension, and slow movements.  We really don't even see any enemies faces except for the German pilot.  I fucking loved it and it did so well showing the horrors of war.  The slow movement across no man's land, when we weren't sure if the Germans actually retreated, with the corpses, bomb craters, and dead horses everywhere was nerve wracking\n\nAnd finally, I need to gush about the scene at dawn with the flares.  One of the most insanely gorgeous scenes I've ever watched.  The choreography of the actors / camera / flares, the scene being so tense and well told without dialogue, and then the colors.  The warm sunlight of the early dawn contrasted with the harsh, blinding white of the flares that arced and threw jagged shadows everywhere.  Holy shit I loved every second\n\nBravo Sam Mendes, bravo.", "What an absolutely beautiful film. The scenes in the dark with the blown out city were some of the most beautiful movie scenes I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAlso, the death scene with Blake was great.

As a huge film fan, I find it harder and harder to be blown away by a director's craft. Sam Mendes has blown my mind. I was sitting in the theatre in awe wondering how he's made this film. The precision in execution to pull off what is essentially one sweeping scene is insanity. Nothing feels off, he has managed to make the viewer feel as if they are one of the main characters. Roger Deakins's cinematography is the best of his legendary career. Watch this on the biggest screen you can find.\n\nIt's not purely a technical feat, *1917* is full of emotion. The performances from Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are superb. These two young men have this huge film resting solely on their shoulders as the two characters who feature extensively. No one has mentioned them in awards talk which is a damn shame. It made me well up thinking about how young these men fighting were and what their families at home had to go through.\n\nWar films often make the mistake of being excessively violent and making their characters feel like pawns rather than humans. *1917* is a film fueled by the concept of togetherness. A film with a big heart and a beautiful message. A worthy Best Picture contender.", "I can't think of a shot that's stuck with me as much as the ruined town at night under flares and fires, it felt like I'd been dropped into a breathing  painting.", "Anyone else think that the French town shot to bits looked like tombstones under the flares? This film was so surreal; there was an almost maddening vibe to it. When Schofield comes to the church and it's in a roaring fire, I had such an unsettling feeling that the fire was somehow alive, lapping at the wood and bodies cast into it, ever hungry, unquenchable. \n\nNever has war been this dirty on film. Bodies floated down the river like flotsam. Trees stuck jaggedly out of the ground like glass. Blood everywhere. Death everywhere. And for such a grimy, dirty film, my god\u2014those shots. Roger Deakins is a genius. The entire sequence in the French town especially was fantastic, the way the flares shot up into the air, and with each fleeting moment of light, we wanted so desperately to be cast into darkness, to stop the bullets from firing, because not seeing anything was better and safer than seeing something. \n\nWhen I saw Schofield look at the tree in the end, I saw ache, pain, and fatigue eat at him. It was inevitable that the film would end where it started, with Schofield lay against the tree, exhausted, wanting so much to lay down to rest, because sooner or later he would be called back into action, and the whole process would start over. What we saw was just a day. A day. And in that short day, many, many humans experienced more torture and toil and tumult and anguish and torment than any person should ever have to deal with. \n\nWhat a beautiful, yet terrifying, film.", "I loved how the movie started and ended with William resting under a tree.", "This is like the first war movie I've seen that had actual Punjabi soldiers.

The 3rd moment is much shorter and only serves as a device for jumping ahead in the timeline, to night time - admittedly used as such by Mendes, to solve the big jump in the objective timeline.\n\n\\- the metal box appears after near-death experience, he takes it out, looks in it, puts it back - its contents are only revealed in the very final scene of the film, and it explains some of his motivations that surround that key question MacKay said in an interview:  when you are put through something that pushes you to your mental and psychological limits, what do you return to?\n\nI'm sure there are other clues not noticed in the film, but this list is enough for one evening :)", "Just came back, I felt tense the entire movie.

Schofield takes a couple seconds to process this and during that time, an elderly man in my theater said, \"In your canteen, son.\" \nWe all felt like we were right there with Schofield. What an immersive, riveting experience!", "I haven't seen anyone talk about the tokens that Schofield gives to the older Blake at the end but I really loved their symbolism. All the discussion about earning a medal and sending it home to your family. Schofield realizes at the end that sometimes \"just a piece of tin\" can mean a great deal to someone in mourning", "I went into this movie knowing that there were very few cuts, which added to the immersion. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was how immersed I would be. I just about jumped every time a gun fired. Even when Schofield was supposedly safe, I was on guard because I didn\u2019t know where the next threat would come from.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the few cuts, it was the sound design too. I was tense up until the very end, no other movie has done that to me.", "The pacing of this movie was fantastic. Never a dull moment.

People who want a semi happy ending think that he is just resting and will continue on.

Open to interpretation and debate to the optimist and realist.", "I really wanted to like it but it just didn't do it for me.\n\nThe technical aspects were great. The one-shot feel, the cinematography, and the production design were all top notch but it just felt like the story and characters were secondary to the \"idea\" of what could be done technically. It just made the story and characters feel a little forced and they just ended up being the means to an end.\n\nI also have to blame the marketing for lessening the effect of the film. Almost every \"money shot\" was shown in the trailers. We were shown the explosion in the bunker, the plane crashing, the shootout on the bridge, the exchange of gunfire in the house, the journey through the ruins (again, only shown for the technical aspects), the jump from the bridge, and the sprint through the battlefield. We essentially knew from the start that at least one of the two main characters completes the journey which kills the ride. There was never anything to worry about, especially since the enemies could never hit a shot and our heroes could run away unharmed. \n\nAt the end of the film, it almost just felt like a demo reel without any real substance. It was like sitting through a boring rollercoaster where, although the engineer did a hell of a job, they forgot that the ride needs to be enjoyable.", "Just from a technical standpoint this was insane. So many gorgeous shots and the sound design was crazy. Those gunshots had me jumping. \n\nI liked the score but also felt the movie relied on it too much sometimes.", "Just fresh out of theater, and if you want a quick thoughts here it is, go see it and if you saw the trailers a while ago don't see them again and for heavens sake avoid the IMDB cast list.\n\nThis movie is a very solid 8/10 for me, and it would be 9/10 if it weren't for just a few little pieces for me personally.\n\n**SPOILER**\n\nI really loved that there was no antagonist, nobody was an asshole to both Will and Blake. I was nervous after they got into an argument about why Blake \"chose\" Will but it was a really minor thing that Will probably felt super guilty about afterwards.\n\nThe one little thing I was talking about earlier was Will's death and how it happened. After the plane crash that they knew was German they saved the pilot. He had some burns on his legs but otherwise was responsive. Will says \"should we put him out of his misery\" he seemed more experienced than Tom Blake and should have taken the lead and secured the prisoner.\n\nTom asking Will to fetch some water for a German soldier who was just trying to kill Allied airmen without first securing him seemed a little off to me. Like I said can be ignored, and I did and really enjoy the rest of the movie.\n\nGreat choice also to not make it super obvious that Will was a father when he was interacting with the baby and French woman. It was a nice touch.\n\nFinally Benedict Cumberbatch pulled out the heavy guns and got his thin mustache out. Old school fans from his Atonement days will remember how well he plays a villain. But Colonel Mackenzie saw that he was wrong and backed down immediately which is truly admirable but like he said next week is going to be a new order that will get them all killed anyway.\n\nI really loved it!", "So the plot of the movie is that Tommen needs to save his brother, who happens to be Rob Stark.", "Overall boring film.

They casted some great actors but pretty much put them in cameo roles.\n\nStory was as straightforward as it gets, Germans were pretty much stormtroopers in terms of effectiveness, dialogue was uninteresting, and overall I didn't really have any investment in the characters or really felt the suspense as much. \n\nI feel like its a very Dunkirk-esque movie in terms of gritty realism, technical achievement, and pacing but failed to really get the audience as interested or invested as Dunkirk did. \n\nIt also felt very shallow in terms as a war movie, especially from the SAME director as Jarhead. It didn't stand to say anything besides war-is-horrific. I wasn't expecting an All Quite on the Western Front but it really just showed a lot of horrific aftermath without really using it to cause any sort of interesting character development. The scene with the crying Captain was a neat touch but overall its a basic war movie.\n\nOverall it felt almost Oscar baity", "The movie serves the gimmick when it should be the other way around. 1917 has some stirring moments, but it is an aggressively mediocre example of what can happen when moviegoers and filmmakers put too much value in long takes.

I get that it\u2019s WW1 and not every war movie should be action packed, but you gotta give me something here. There were like 4 major \u201caction\u201d scenes (tripwire, plane, shootout, chasing German) and the trailer showed half of them.

Deakins is superb as always and Mendes has exceptional direction. But the story?

It all just becomes rather monotonous. Many scenes in hindsight appear to be no more than filler to pad the runtime.\n\nGot to say, after all the hype I left the theater rather disappointed.

I've seen some complaints that the \"story\" is a little weak, but I couldn't disagree more, the attitudes and behavior of the characters are exactly what you would expect from men who've been victimized by war for 3 years.

If you are watching it to expect her to be there then don't even bother. There is a 1 minute scene in the beginning and that is it. If you want to see her that bad go watch the trailer shes in there and that is it. The only purpose of that scene is to set up the movie coming to America. A woman who worked with Yoko (from the first movie) comes home after being inside the Saeki house and ends up killing her husband and daughter and then herself. This then effects an elderly couple that movies in a year later (this story is generally actually unsettling). But nothing makes any sense compared to the original movies, even the other American movies. \n\nFor starters all the ghosts look like ZOMBIES. Seriously there is a scene with a main character looking around a police station at night with her flashlight and sidearm and there is an obvious jump scare with a zombie... no this isn't Resident Evil.\n\nAlso the most prominent spirit (by a slight margin) is the little girl Melinda who is the daughter of the woman we met at the beginning of the movie. This makes it feel like a Ring movie. She's a little girl with long dark hair. She's usually water logged since she was drowned and her whole appearance screams Samara Morgan. No. Just. No. \n\nMy biggest complaint, besides the lack of Kayako, is because of the lack of Kayako. ALL THE GHOSTS HAVE HER DEATH RATTLE!! This is just a big F U to the franchise. Kayako's death rattle is specific TO HER because of how Takeo killed her. It doesn't spread to other people. She has it because it was the last sound she could make trying to scream out to her son Toshio after Takeo crushed her windpipe and broke her neck. NO BODY ELSE SHOULD HAVE IT!!! If the movie would have revealed later that Kayako's spirit was here and controlling everything then that would have been totally fine and even made some kind of sense. But since the MAIN CHARACTER OF THE FRANCHISE is not even used or recognized... it makes everything feel dumb and senseless.\n\nIf you are a huge fan of this franchise tell me what you think. Maybe I am missing something. There are some nice easter eggs and you can tell the director is a fan of this franchise (you spot the number 4 many many times throughout the film as an obvious nod only die-hard fans will recognize the significance of and for that I appreciate it).", "Imagine having that AMA open after the release of this film", "For those that seen it, is Kayako actually in it? Because the trailers barely show her.", "Early contender for worst movie of the year, I was not a huge fan of the first Grudge remake (I love the original) but this was just awful. People were laughing when the credits hit in my theater.", "Felt like the director wanted to make The Ring but was forced to do The Grudge and wasn't suited for those type of scares. Aside from a couple good scenes the bulk the scares break down into two types. The audiences notices a ghost in the background that a character doesn't see and/or a ghost suddenly appears directly in front of a character while making an ugly face. There are a lot of scare scenes but I didn't really get the sense of overwhelming dread like I still do watching the originals. A lot of that has to do with the story and how they slightly shifted what it meant to be cursed. \n\n\nThe grudge no longer outright kills you. Rather makes you kill the ones you love. Yes the original curse could do that but this movie seems to be entirely focused on that aspect. We're meant to ask ourselves if our hero will end up killing her own son, then during the climax question if she's about to be tricked into doing it. Ok but the problem is all the scare scenes fall flat because we know the characters in each of the storylines will perform the murders later on, not the ghosts haunting them now. This is the fundamental change from the originals because in those any single scene could be fatal. The non-linear storytelling was used to great effect there because it didn't matter when characters died, could happen at any time. In this movie the non-linear storytelling is simply used to keep 3 different plot arcs separated from each other, with all 3 concluding in the 3rd act one after another. \n\n\nSo the story is really weird with how much of a focus it has on the theme of killing our loved ones but what is it trying to say? Is it even try to say anything? The pregnant couple have a difficult decision about their baby. They're choosing life or death for a loved one, which we specifically have a scene with the mother spelling out how much she loves their unborn child. This mirrors the elderly couple and the husband choosing assisted suicide for his wife because she can't choose for herself. She even says, \"he tried to kill me\" when we see how their story ultimately resolved. Because of these storylines the curse functions differently, which means the scares aren't as effective, and the whole thing is really frustrating. It can't work as its own thing because it depends on the grudge mythos too much but still tries and fails. \n\nAnother thing that was really annoying was the focus on the big guy haunting the cop rather than Kayako. I know she doesn't have any connection to anything really but neither does he. We never see that storyline other than the fallout from it during the climax flashbacks. It doesn't mean anything.", "This is the kind of horror movie to expect in January:  dull and uninspired.\n\nThe biggest surprise was the R rating.

I don't usually care for gore and even I was surprised by how mild the film was considering its R-rating. If you dislike jump scares, \"The Grudge\" is overflowing with those and none are scary. I also found Betty Gilpin's arc to be tasteless and emotionally offensive. Just to throw some positive bits, Andrea Riseborough and Lin Shaye are good. They did the best with what they got especially Shaye. \n\nGo see the film at your own peril, it is deeply boring and monotone and most of the film is jump scare after jump scare.

I didn't even flinched. The whole movie is basically a spam of cheap jumpscare that you can see coming from miles away. Didn't heard any scream in my theater.\n\nEven the story doesn't make sense. I was trying to figure out the \"logic\" behind the curse. The movie implies that the curse is permanent and stays inside the house. Anyone who gets inside a house where a brutal murder happened is cursed. Ok. Then what about all the police officers, detectives, crime scene experts/techniciens that investigate the house? They should all be dead.\n\n+ I don't get why some people get killed and some not. Like the black husband and his wife.

The only movie that I watched for free with AMC A-List and felt like I got ripped off, because it wasn't even capable of being bad in funny ways.

Because the original Japanese film is one of my all-time favorites, I'm interested to see how fucking bad they do here. \n\nBut I feel it wouldn't even be worth the drive.", "I posted a smaller comment already but I need to fully vent about this movie.  I saw 110 2019 releases, and every one of them was better than this.  It's like somebody watched the American remake of The Grudge and thought \"You know, this is still too Japanese.  Let's move it to Texas, take out all the good parts, and make everything fucking orange for some reason.\"  I honestly think if in 2030 I still care about movies enough to try and put together a worst of the decade list, this will be high (low?) on that list. The only things of artistic merit in this movie are the DVD covers for 48 Hours and The French Connection.\n\nWhat I liked: This is a short list. I think most of the performers did the best they could with such shitty material. I thought Frankie Faison's character motivation was an interesting take on the curse that I hadn't seen before in the franchise. And I thought some of the effects were decent. Lorna's corpse in the car being the standout.\n\nWhat I didn't like: The orange color grading might drive me insane, and I'm not normally bothered by it. Like if you're going to do it to that degree, at least use a color that will add to the movie's atmosphere. Every scare in this movie is a garbage jump scare with no real tension. Even the one that had a decent start (the trash bag at the beginning) gets thrown away for a cheap jump. I mentioned that I liked some of the effects, but others were really bad. The ghosts looked pretty bad as a whole, as did the fly effects, and Lin Shaye's character death was almost comically bad. And the movie isn't bad in an entertaining or interesting way, it just sucks. It's not a swing-and-a-miss, because that would imply they tried something. It's more like the cinematic equivalent of a strike out looking.\n\nAnd the worst part is I was actually pretty excited for this. Nicolas Pesce is a new director to me, but I've heard good things about his work, the cast is great, and I think both the Japanese original and the American remake are solid (it's a rare case where I think both the remake and original do different things better than the other, and are a similar quality overall). But this didn't just not live up to my expectations, it was worse than I feared it could be.\n\nThis is a tier below bad horror movies. This makes Countdown or The Curse of La Llorona look good. This is kind of an obvious callout, but this reminds me a lot of Rings. They're both long-after sequels to American remakes of Japanese horror movies, and they both suck everything that was good about the originals out. Rings was my least favorite movie of 2017, and this is off to a strong head start for my least favorite of 2019 (EDIT: I'm not used to the new year yet, I meant 2020). I think this is probably worse than Rings in a vacuum, but I prefer The Ring series to The Grudge series so Rings was an even greater disappointment. This is a 1/5. I hate this movie so much.", "Ok guys I've given this movie's plot way too much thought, but please bear with me, I'd like to know if i miss something or if these things really don't make any sense: \n\n\u2022 I understand that the curse was bound to the Reyburn 44 house, (even though it was brought in from japan) because Detective Goodman (the one who was constantly smoking) wasn't haunted even though he worked on the case. I understood that was because he didn't enter the house!! So why didn't burning the house work?\n\n\u2022 Perhaps because the grudge was bound to a new house. The house in which Muldoon moved after she burned the Reyburn drive house is the same house where the asian guy killed his pregnant wife. So I guess that's why the curse was reinforced there (btw. How did she not know that about her new house?! She knew about the case of the asian guy and would know were the murder happened...)\n\n\u2022 Are the ghosts able to kill off people? During the first few stories of hauntings the ghosts drove their victims crazy to a point where they killed their loved ones, and then themselves...they never actually killed someone. (Except maybe the asian guy, we did not see that) So what really happened in the end? Was Muldoon the first one to be killed directly by a ghost? \n\nThanks for reading,\nHave a nice evening!", "I actually fell asleep in the cinema watching this", "The best part was the little kid running to his mom and turning into the dead girl.
