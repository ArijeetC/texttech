Well acted all around, had me tearing up. ", "Were...were those kids being taken as sex slaves?", "The type of rich, diverse stories that producers in the US should be buying/funding.  Great acting from both Saroos, great score (second only to Jackie, maybe?).  Two things that keep it from being overall great:  I think we needed more time with young Saroo in Australia and more time with adult Saroo before he becomes so obsessed.  As it is, it goes quickly from \"kid gets new home!\" to \"young adult still feels lost and kinda crazy\", and I could have used a little more of a bridge.  Awful, while the writing overall is pretty good, Nicole Kidman's speech about her vision of a brown boy in the field...brutal.  Overall, really good flick.", "How was Patel's Australian accent? Because from the snippets I heard from the trailer I thought it had the potential to be one of the best, if not the best, Australian accents of all time.", "It was a good film, though there are some flaws. Rooney Mara's character felt like a tacked on love interest that barely affected the plot. It felt a little too serious or over-dramatized at times, I know the guy was troubled over his past but at times there could have been a few more moments of joy.\n\nStill, it has a great musical score. The movie also managed to keep a great flow of the events, keeping it from losing suspense.", "I feel sorry for the real life Mantosh, whose portrayal in this film was pretty harsh. I don't recall the book suggesting he had drug problems. He interacts with the family and works for his dad's company. \n\nJudging by a comment on his Facebook page, he found the interpretation of his character offensive and hurtful.\n\nSaroo handled it fairly sensitively in the book, not giving too much away, but they seem to have used stretched the limits of poetic license in the film.", "I'm really happy to see this thread. I was looking at an old one from before the movie came out and I found a lot of nasty comments about how Saroo was stupid because he didn't know his way home. We are all commenting on computers and technology that comes so easily to us that some people don't even realize their privilege. He knew how to get to his home by himself from places near by, but he ended up extremely far away. He mispronounced the name of a small village that might not have been on any map. The movie ended saying that 80,000 children are lost in a year, there aren't the resources to try everything to reunite each child. They put his picture in the news paper, but his family couldn't afford a news paper and a news paper may not have even reach their village. He was also uneducated and when moved in with his adoptive family, it was the first time he ever saw a map. Also, unlike in the countries most of us are from, I read that he feared going to the police, because they didn't help beggars and would just bring him to an orphanage. A lot of people on the street were unwilling to help and they ignored him. I was also heartbroken to see people call her a bad mother. Yes, in our privilege countries, parents would get in trouble for letting their child do all the things that he did and she would be considered a bad mother, but we don't understand that poverty: to not be able to feed your family, to work for hours and get maybe a rupee, to beg for scraps just to get by while still being hungry. Being a single parent is hard even in privileged countries (#spoiler)", "This movie fucked me up. Our problems are so trivial comparatively.\n\nBeautiful film. Sunny Pawar should win best supporting actor, if not best actor, at the Oscars for real.", "The first half in India is amazing. The last 20 minutes starting when Saroo stumbles upon his home town is amazing. That middle half hour was not very good and holds it back from being truly great.\n\nThe first 2/3 of the movie I kept thinking to myself \"Lion.....why is this movie called Lion? I'm sure there's some symbolism that'll show up later to clarify.\" As the last act unfolded, I forgot all about it. Then those text overlays popped up at the end....added a great deal of frission to the emotions I was already feeling.\n\nGod damn those last twenty minutes are so powerful. Holy damn.\n\nI agree with the criticism that Rooney Mara's character is wasted. His adoptive brother, though, I feel is a bit crucial to this movie. That relationship needed more attention. A big theme of this movie is the relationship between brothers. It starts and ends with Saroo and Guddu. Guddu is constantly appearing in his thoughts and dreams (more than his mom I felt like). There is definitely a thread here that the director tried to explore but it isn't very well realized.  ", "[deleted]", "So was the brother hit by the train that night? My friends and I thought the writing at the end was a tad confusing. It would have made sense if so because that's why he didn't come back for Saroo. Either way, so sad once we read that news :(\n\nReally enjoyed the movie, I hadn't seen Dev Patel in anything since Slumbdog Millionaire, he's just FANTASTIC. He also got extremely handsome.", "Guddu?", "Great movie. Definitely lopsided though, just because the first half was so much more engaging with young Saroo being so phenomenal and the stakes so much higher. Dev Patel was great but 10 minutes or so could've easily been shaved from the back half, or maybe shown more time in India.\n\nI agree that Mara's character wasn't great... but the lowest point for me was the monologue by Kidman. I mean, most of it was powerful when she was talking about loving both kids and choosing not to adopt, but it really suffered from that bit about \"having visions at age 12 about adopting a little brown boy.\" And she keeps referring to the kid as \"it.\" And does this mean she refused to adopt asian or black kids because her vision specified the kid had to be brown? It was very silly and contrived. I wonder if it's because the real-life mother had a bit a religious streak that they felt obligated to touch upon.\n\nAll in all, definitely deserves the oscar nom although some flaws from the back half make it hard to say it deserves to win.\n\nBut seriously, Young Saroo running was the cutest fucking thing. ", "Young Saroo was amazing. Really great perfomrance. Very believable. \n\nThose \"trafficking\" scenes really hurt and I still think about.  Held back a lot of tears at the end, especially the scene where [Kidman talks about how she can have children.  What a powerful scene.](#spoiler) ", "I am grown ass man and I found myself crying like a little bitch while watching this movie. I felt the worst for his bro Guddu. In some way he was spared the pain of not seeing his brother for the 25 years and probably feeling guilty for having taken him with him. This was just a purely emotional and beautiful movie.

I saw the movie and was so eager to discuss with others!\n\nOverall, the movie was really moving and, in my mind, avoided a lot of the cliches that I  thought might be coming.  Sunny and Dev ably carry the entire movie and I thought they both did an outstanding job. \n\nReading a little about the actual story, I would have liked to see more of the real details included in the movie (apparently he rode multiple local trains around Kolkata for a few days before leaving the train station) but understand why they weren't included. I would have also liked a little more backstory on the brother and delving more into Saroo's relationship with him vs that of his with Guddu. \n\nDid anyone else think it was odd that Saroo never mentioned his sister? I think it was because he was closer to his brother but it was odd that he only mentioned that his mother and brother were looking for him, but never mentioned Sheikla, his sister. \n\nI loved the cinematography - the overhead shots to mirror the shots from Google Earth were great. \n\nNot a dry eye in our theater at the end - I really loved it.

Haven't had to fight back tears in a theater like that in a long time.\n\nWith all the shit going on today (I know you could say that about any time period but still) it's important that people see something like this. The world is so much bigger than what we perceive in our own lives. I have nothing but respect for Sheru's parents, it takes a lot to bring in a child like that and fully embrace who they are. No one is perfect but I think they are great people for doing that. Not my favorite film of 2016, but probably the most emotional one. I'm a bit sad it's not getting more attention.\n\nedit: also the child actor for Saroo looked just like his actual childhood pictures; I was amazed by that. Would be dope if that kid won something", "I'll tear up during a movie every now and then, but I full on cried like 4 times. Not a perfect movie by any means, but damn good.

When he had trouble eating with his hands, people asking where he is from, etc...\n\nBeing adopted myself I get this all the time. People asking if I celebrate Chinese new year, if I speak Chinese, if I loooooove rice, etc etc...\n\nI think the movie handled it well and hopefully now more people understand. I was adopted as a baby, I don't remember anything and my parents are Canadians. I'm more Canadian than I will ever be Chinese.", "I loved this movie. As a whole I understand why some people thought it was slow in the middle, but I thought there were so many great scenes (the scene where the kids are learning the names of the utensils??? So great.) I cried hysterically about 100 times, but 3 scenes stick out to me:\n\n-The scene where Saroo meets with the lady at the orphanage, and before he leaves he stops and asks, \"Did you really look for my Mum?\" Sunny Pawar absolutely slayed that scene and the actress playing the woman was great, too.\n\n-The scene where Saroo meets his adoptive family. Nicole Kidman's face was so full of wonder.\n\n-When old Saroo sees Ganesh Teile on Google Earth and says, \"Ami.\" *cue me having a full on loud sob*", "Wow. That movie really moved me..\n\nDefinitely the weakest part was the middle of the movie but overall still a really strong movie. I'm a grown man and I was bawling like a baby throughout the movie \n\nIt really gives you perspective of how fucked up some people's lives are compared to us. Thousands of kids every year suffer the same fate as Saroo, but what differs is that Saroo had a happy ending. \n\nI really hope this wins an award at the Oscars. 8.5/10", "I fucking cried in the cinema for the first time in my life.\n\nLion isn't a perfect film - the second \"act\" of this film in Australia is nowhere near as good or powerful as any of the stuff in India, and suffers mainly from some pacing problems... but I can forgive all that as there is a wonderful story being told here, and the acting from old and young Saroo is just wonderful... oh, and it made me bloody cry.", "Who exactly was rama? That fuckin pervert was a pedo? Or was he a agent to get kids to beg for money??? ", "This movie was incredible. I was holding back tears by the end just in awe of such an unbelievable feat. Looking past some of the minor missteps such as the Rooney Mara subplot and typical Oscar baity type scenes, this film is a fantastic case of perseverance and triumph.", "Just watched the movie today- wow, there really was not a dry eye in the cinema. I held it together until the very last scene with the two Mums hugging. As an adoptive Mum myself, it was particularly poignant. \n\nThe scenes with young Saroo in India were so well done, it almost made the rest of it a let down. ", "Young Saroo and Guddu and their mom's performances were so beautiful, subtle, believable and endearing. \nTheir bond is beautiful and I wanted to cry before anything even happened.\n\nRooney Mara's character was totally not needed in this movie, and if anything completely slowed it down. That whole part lost my interest from what was an incredible start. I was only happy when she got out of the picture, and we focused again on Saroo's return to India. I was aggravated whenever she would reappear in the picture. What she said was inconsistent, and I did not care whatsoever about her. But I guess every movie has to have the whole \"love\" thing. In this one, if they made it a less central part, the movie would've been phenomenal. I don't get how she got a spot in the front cover..\n\nDoes anyone have theories on what Noor and Rama(?) were up to?

The big surprise to me is how Dev Patel bulked out and how he handled the lead role.  Unfortunately the image in my brain is of Slumdog and would never have recognized him at all in this film.  And his Aussie accent sounded dead on.\n\nI had minor story quibbles - mainly with Saroo's adopted brother - I understand why it needed to be dramatized but I thought the source material was so strong.  And I understand having the American girlfriend so that there is a love interest.  But these were little things that are easily overlooked by the strong first and third act.  Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman are both excellent.", "I have a younger brother and 2 small boys and the movie hit me hard.

That's just me though ", "A couple of things I didn't understand:\n\n-When those street children were being chased by those men... what were they going to do with the children they caught?\n\n-What was Noor and that man planning to do with Saroo?\n\n-When Saroo is in the orphanage, one of the boys is taken out and goes away with a man and is supposed to be brought back before morning, what is that about?\n\nI bawled through that whole movie though.

Though the part she said she could have had a child but chose to adopt instead, was powerful. Anyways, my biggest issue was the score! Which is the most favoured part of the movie as I've seen so far. The theme song was beautifully construct and so moving, but I just get disturbed when the same song is played multiple times throughout the movie, I can't help it. And Sia's song at the end?? WHAT THE F WAS THAT? I was furious when I heard it because the whole movie was such a great experience, and that ending, just when the emotionality peaked and we're truly content with it, so many people were crying, so many feelings, a lot to think about, and then, BOOM goes that upbeat, irritating pop song. I mean, tell me please, why the heck did they do that?!", "Just watched it my God im a guy and was holding back tears the whole time. Grew up in Pakistan and this movie brought me back. I miss home. \nThis movies definitely in my top 10", "Been a while since I cried like I did while watching this movie.

Not sure if I'm emotionally stable enough to watch it because the trailer alone made me cry but it also seems like a really good movie", "Genuinely amazing film. Sunny and Dev both perfectly play Saroo, to the point where it at times felt like I was watching a documentary instead of a film. This is a top three film of 2016 for me. I wanted to watch it again immediately after it finished.", "This movie was so powerful! The critics weren't kidding when they said it was a tearjerker. Lovely score, cinematography, acting. The first half worked better because it was more linear, the second half is messier due to many character introductions but still worked well overall. The final scenes of him reconnecting with his mother and walking on the rails had me in tears", "Little late here, but I just saw it and I wondered if anyone had discussed what I'm about to write below.\n\nSo, assuming the events in the movie are somewhat accurate, this really bugged me. When the kid is at the police station, they ask him where he lives. He says \"Ginestlay.\" Obviously, that's not correct and none of them have heard of it.\n\nBut even in the 80s is there no fucking, like, book somewhere of \"Towns in India\" or anything? Like a City official or something?\n\nI mean, I can excuse that, okay, since it's the 80s and they probably didn't really give a shit about trying to help some kid.\n\nBut then we go fast-forward to 2008 when Saruu is using Google. They didn't even show him trying to google \"Ginestlay\", but I mean, wouldn't it have been hilarious if Google had said, \"Did you mean Ganesh Talai?\" Or even go find a registry of towns in India, search by the Gs. Eventually he would have seen that name (pretty early on since it was G-a), and would have remembered how similar it sounded.\n\nIt just seems crazy that he found the town \"By accident\" instead of Googling when he had a pretty good idea of what the name phonetically sounded like.", "Beautiful film but I have a question. Is the film supposed to have this really low contrast look with super milky blacks? I'm asking because the trailers (even though they rarely have final color timing) looked normal, but when I saw it, it's exactly like I described it. Messing with the contrast, it does look infinitely better, I kept being pissed at the color timer because it just dragged the visuals down.\n\nThen again, Greig Fraser's work (the DP) on Rogue One, and other films bears that low contrast, slightly milky look. \n\nAnyone?", "The soundtrack was really good!\n\nThe movie itself did stall about 4/5 of the way through, but the rest of it was fantastic.", "Too much feels, this is why I watch movies alone.", "I thought it was a good movie, especially the portions set in India.

To wit:  150-180 children a day kidnapped off India's streets.  Horrible situation.  \n\nAs much I enjoyed The Lion, that thought is lingering with me much longer than the movie's shining plot.  I regularly meet folks from India, smart, engaging people.  And everyone is supposed to give India and its peoples a pass on their child kidnap situation that they elect to ignore?  Criminal.", "I thought this film was just okay. It's not the worst kind of Oscar bait but it just felt very standard to me, complete with requisite Oscar clip scenes where one of the leads gives a big speech. I felt the troubled brother storyline was totally unresolved, I didn't feel much tension in the searching scenes, and overall I cared so much more about the scenes of just Saroo and Lucy as a couple then the search.\n\nWhat I will say is the opening sequence just focusing on young Saroo is great. Garth Davis definite shows he has some skills as a director and it made me excited for his Mary Magdalene film. Also the score I thought was quite excellent. ", "I thought this was pretty good. The second half isn't quite as good as the first half and I wished Rooney Mara's character was more of, you know, a character and less of a plot device, but I really liked it.

I know it's based on a true story, but did anyone else feel that it is almost unrealistic that Saroo was able to find his family again?  I have a pretty good memory from when I was a child but I find it hard to believe that Saroo was able to remember as much as he did.  Using google maps is such a cool idea, but again the fact he was able to locate where he grew up based on a map? I can't wrap my head around that! ", "I LOVED the first 35minutes, the cinematography was astounding, that kid was fantastic. It was beautiful and so powerful but I'm sorry everything when he was grown-up was a waste. He was a mopey, lazy protagonist, nothing happened until eventually he was just looking at maps and moping. I hated it. So frustrating. I can't believe how disappointed this film made me. Even the ending, I knew I was suppose to feel something when he finally met his mother but I was so annoyed at that point. Such a disappointment. Also, I get it drone shots = google map, good for you. I'm sure the book is amazing and has more depth to it but the whole 2nd-3rd act was a wash. Sad because I'm sure it's an amazing story.

Like the drums beating over and over again, with everyone feeling their vibrations - the planes had a similar effect. \n\nShe wanted everyone there to feel her pain.

That is without a doubt one of the best film experiences of my life.\" \n\nI've never been as invested in the topic but I also thought it was superbly crafted. I was apprehensive towards casting Portman but it's clear that she has poured herself into this performance. \n\nIf you need convincing, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbFt4h3Dkkw) - the original White House tour documentary (start at 6:17). Look at the way JK holds her hands,  pauses between her words, and averts her eyes from time to time, and compare it to Portman's portrayal. I would not have believed [Padme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buyflmtHcHc) could pull something like this off. \n\nHer portrayal aside, Lorraine has organized a lot of moving parts in a very compelling way. So much so that the sound of the gunshot ringing through her head and the following camera glide up and over the back of the limo as Clint Hill clings to the back of it have transitioned from a photo, to an actual experience for me. \n\nWithout a doubt in my Top Five of 2016 - I hope it's not left out of the awards conversation. ", "Bleh. Was on a roll of good movies, having loved *La La Land*, *Manchester by the Sea*, and *Moonlight*. Heard great things about this one...  \n  \nBut I strongly disliked it. I didn't feel moved, I barely felt sympathy for any character, I didn't learn anything new historically, I wasn't in suspense... When the movie finally seems to reveal what it's trying to say, all I could think was \"Well duh... you've been making this point very clearly for an hour now.\" I literally cannot remember the last time I saw a movie that felt this pointless and protracted. I wish I understood why some people loved it so much.  \n  \nI even thought Natalie Portman's acting was weak, despite all the hype \u2014 it never felt like anything other than watching Natalie Portman do an okay (if stilted) impression of Jackie O. I watched some interviews with the real Onassis afterward to see if this movie had somehow given her a different dimension, and instead it just further cemented how little the story or performances had affected me at all: I ended up just feeling like \"nah, they got her wrong.\"", "I thought this film was very fascinating. I'll start by saying Pablo Larrain is the master of capturing the look of a time period. With this and No, I hope he does a lot more films about historical figures. I love the way it explored the iconography of Jackie and the way legacy is so often constructed rather than earned. Portman gives one of the best performances of the year and easily the best one of her career. The score is unreal. I will see any film Mica Levi scores from now on. While I wasn't quite in love with the Terrence Malick style editing or having three different frame narratives this film was extremely unique and the kind of oddball biopic I want to see more of.  ", "Saw this on Christmas Eve. One of my favorite films of the year. I didn't know Noah Oppenheim had it in him to write something this good and this different from most biopics. I loved how Pablo Larrain and Stephane Fontaine made the film look like it came from the 1960's and I also loved how they recreated the time period. The score by Mica Levi works beautifully and the performances are all great. The MVP, of course, is Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy. I'd say she gives her best performance here (yes, better than Black Swan). A haunting, powerful, and stunning piece of work.", " Cynical, self-indulgent, trite, formulaic and ultimately empty. \n\n  The trailer for Hidden Figures that played prior to the feature moved me more than Jackie did.", "Natalie Portman's performance is titanic. Like an \"all-time\" performance. It'll be looked back as one of the best regardless of whether or not she wins an oscar for it.", "The music and the cinematography was sensational. The assassination scenes were so tragic and beautiful. ", "Good movie.  I thought it was interesting how it's hard to categorize.  It wasn't conventionally melodramatic enough to be an Oscar bait movie.  It was more of an arthouse character/mood piece, yet it also wasn't experimental enough to win critical claim with the arthouse crowd (besides the score and Portman's performance).  Anyway, after the movie I couldn't stop thinking about Jackie's situation, how she behaved, what must have been on her mind, dealing with a tragedy, etc.", "The guy who played LBJ looked and acted nothing like him. It was particularly jarring after seeing Bryan Cranston nail the role in *All the Way*. But obviously he was not the focus of the film so it's a minor complaint, yet it is my biggest one.\n\nPortman nailed the role and the voice though. She's certainly improved significantly in terms of accents since *V For Vendetta*, that's for sure. So far she's my frontrunner for Best Actress, even though she probably won't actually win because all of Hollywood is wanking over *La La Land* right now.\n\nThe score was phenomenal and extremely unconventional in the best way possible. Felt it captured the mood perfectly. Set and costume designs were also great. It all added up to create a spot-on atmosphere.\n\nThe focus of the movie was not at all what I expected. I expected more standard biopic fare. This was, instead, more of a meditation on grief and a psychological profile of Jackie in the days following the assassination. This pleasantly surprised me and it gave the movie a focus and depth lacking in most traditional biopics. The movie is depressing as all hell because of it, but it worked for me anyway. A movie about this subject shouldn't be a joy to watch; like Jackie herself insisting that all see her blood-stained dress, it shows the raw and painful truth of the tragedy. It was neither overwrought or over-long. It was a film with a specific theme to convey, and I think it succeeded.\n\nSurprised to see it getting some hate here, but I can certainly understand why someone wouldn't *enjoy* the movie. Dismissing its strengths as a work of art, though, is just wrong as far as I'm concerned. It's also a good work of historical drama that should certainly be of interest to anyone with an interest in US presidential history, or the Kennedy administration/assassination particularly. If you don't possess such an interest, I can see how it wouldn't do much for you but it is still certainly a well-made film.\n\nBonus note: John Hurt's role as the priest just made the movie feel even more somber to me, knowing now this was his last role. (At least the last he was alive to see released; perhaps there are posthumous roles coming out I am unaware of, but still.)", "Extremely overrated. There were some shots I liked, the music was OK, and Natalie Portman's performance was acceptable (I would not consider it Oscar-worthy though, but I wasn't really a big fan of hers to begin with) However, the pace was extremely slow and overall the film was simply forgettable", "I think the best or most startlingly moment in the film is when she takes a shower. And you just see red washing over her back. It's amazing how simple and subtle it showcases how traumatic that whole event was. ", "Saw it on Wednesday. Thought it was pretty low key but extremely well done", "Yeah wasn't a huge fan but Natalie Portman was fantastic. Does anyone know how accurate her bizarre voice was to the real Jackie?", "I really enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I wasn't *too* interested in the subject material and I was mostly going in for Natalie Portman's acting, but it was just so damn interesting on a technical level. The music was strange and a little off-putting, but in a good way (to me). The way the entire movie was shot was intimate and a little chaotic; half the movie was spent right in Jackie's face.\n\nPortman brought so much life to a character that I didn't really know too much about. The subtle anger in her performance was spectacular. Jackie was such an interesting character -- seemingly weak on the surface, but she knows *exactly* how she is viewed and how to use that to her advantage. The scenes between Portman and Crudup were especially great; I loved how assertive Crudup's character was without being too pushy. You could feel the tension in their back-and-forth but also their respect.\n\nI can understand why some people might not like it though, as it was a little slow. The woman next to me in the theater fell asleep and started snoring. I had to wake her up, it was weird.\n\nOverall it is definitely in my top 10 for the year. I *liked* it when I watched it, but it's one of those movies that I enjoyed even more as I reflected on it afterwards.", "Just got out of a screening where the screenwriter, Noah Oppenheim did a Q&A.  This gets a thumbs up, not too enthusiastically, but it is worth a look.\n\nPluses:  This avoids the trappings of the normal bio-pic and focuses on the post assassination.  Billy Crudup as the journalist is a device to frame the story with flashbacks to the CBS TV tour Jackie gave in 1961.  Best scenes for me were with John Hurt as a priest.  Some sequences of the film are absolutely great, much credit to Pablo Larrain and a score that took lots of chances.\n\nMinuses - Narrative sometimes lost momentum and story seemed to get lost.  Thought Natalie Portman forced it a bit, especially with the White House tour which really wasn't that important.  Some of the scenes with Billy Crudup also felt flat or forced.\n\nLarrain is a very interesting choice to direct this film and this paid off in that regard.  Portman does her best with such an iconic character but I've seen her better.\n\n", "Natalie Portman's performance saved it for me. ", "Oh boy, finally! \n\nI saw this a week ago and was...underwhelmed. The interview scenes felt very lacking, I probably could've gone without them entirely.\n\nWhen Portman was good, she was GOOD. That said, there were definitely a number of points where my immersion broke and I was aware I was watching Natalie Portman instead of Jackie O. \n\nThe cinematography was nice. You really got that cramped, stressful feeling of the situation. \n\nThe rest of the actors were...eh. Nothing special. \n\nThe music was solid in and of itself, but I really felt like the desired mood was being particularly shoved in my face. \n\nSo all in all...eh. It's a better than usual biopic, and Portman's best actress nomination is deserved, but whether she should win is another question.  \n\nEdit: oh, also, the set/costuming was wonderful. Easily my favorite part of the movie. ", "So, I had a lot of thoughts about this film. I think it tried a lot of things but didn't have a clear conception of what it wanted to be, and because of that it suffered. Portman's Jackie is great and on point, though the accent work in some scenes could have used a bit more work; especially in the early interview segments it felt forced and took me out of it a bit.\n\n There are definitely moments that are resonant and powerful [Jackie explaining to her children that their father is dead, for example](#spoiler). However, I think that overall the film can't decide if it wants to be a film about a grieving mother or a film about Jackie Kennedy orchestrating the legacy of JFK. Furthermore, I really felt as though the inclusion of the assassination at the end of the film was unnecessary and took away from the film. We'd already seen everything surrounding the assassination, and it was heart wrenching to see Jackie's response to it by itself, and it felt as though it didn't need to be shown. When it was, it felt like it was more for shock value than anything else. \n\nLastly, I thought the score was overbearing. The heavy, dissonant track that played over and over was an interesting addition at first, but as it continues to be repeated it felt as though the movie was yelling at me to be sad. I felt as though the score didn't believe in the ability of the movie to be genuinely emotionally affecting, so it attempted to overcompensate by serving as emotional cues that ulitmately weren't necessary. That said, some people I saw the movie with liked the score a lot, so maybe that's just a me thing. Ultimately, I'd give this like a 3/5. Not an awful movie, just not one I particularly need to see again.\n\n", "Saw it with the family on Christmas Day which we all agreed probably wasn't the best film for Christmas, but oh well!\n\nNatalie Portman's performance is really good, the music is really haunting too. \n\nWhoever casted JFK was spot on by the way, he looked the part very well. Peter Sarsgaard though? I just don't care for him to begin with.\n\nIt was good, not my absolute favorite of the year, and not one I'd probably ever see again though. But if you like seeing the award films this season, go see it!", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNkkApo7DDs", "I never expected a movie about JFK's wife to be this good, it's easily in my top 5. Portman gave her best performance in years and the best female performance of the year. Like everyone else is saying the soundtrack and technical aspects(lighting, shot composition, etc.) are magnificent. Very personal and intimate film, don't know if I was the only one, but the ending left me with such sad/melancholic feeling inside. I felt like I was on the verge of tears by the end.", "I just forced my way through this.  Bored rigid.  Wasn't too sure going in but I'm quite a fan of a biopic so I thought I would give it a shot.  \n\nIm not convinced there was enough meat on the bones to make this into a film.  I came away wondering what had actually happened in the last hour and a half of my life.  I just wasn't interested in what little plot there was \n\nI thought Natalie Portman was excellent (although god that accent was a bit annoying).  One of the few scenes in the film I actually thought was well done was telling the kids what had happened.\n\nMaybe just too \"artsy fartsy\" for my common taste in films.  4/10", "Wow, saw this last week and just watched the actual tour of the White House Jackie gave.  It's incredible how Natalie Portman is dead on with her performance, every mannerism is perfect.  Will be gutted if she doesn't win best actress.", "I really did not like this movie. While the costumes were visually wonderful, I thought everything else about it was not good. I did not even enjoy Portman's performance. The direction was choppy and in some ways difficult to follow. \n\nI was severely disappointed, and my expectations were low. ", "I saw Jackie back during TIFF. Stuck with me for a week. Best way to describe it? Haunting. That score, the mesmerizing performance from Natalie Portman, the direction. All brilliant. ", "I loved how this wasn't a stereotypical biopic and was more of an intimate arthouse piece on grief. <3\nAlso, Natalie Portman was absolutely stellar. Her performance is definitely in my top five of the year ranked along with Isabelle Huppert, Sandra H\u00fcller, Sonia Braga, and Sasha Lane", "Took my Grandmother, who is in her mid eighties, to see this movie. Thought she was gonna have a damn heart attack because those gun shot sounds were SO LOUD in the theater. ", "Loved this. Larrain is a master. Think of all the themes touched on in these 95 minutes: grief, faith, family, celebrity, politics, history. And it's easy to be cynical about Portman doing something like this - the absurd overcommitment, the self-seriousness, the predetermined Oscar. But goddamn, this was an arresting performance. Impossible to take your eyes off her.", "I saw it last week and loved it.  Natalie Portman should win Best Actress.", "The graveyard scene, the scene in the plane directly after the assassination, and the scene where Jackie confronted her children, top 3 scenes of the year for sure. Incredible. \n\nThat being said, I thought Natalie Portman's accent was a little unnatural and distracting. From the first line, it just felt off but I couldn't place why. ", "It underwhelmed me. I'm not sure what I expected, but it just didn't feel right. It was fine, but something about Portman felt off to me. I felt really aware that she was wearing a wig. The score was fantastic, but everything else just rang somewhat hollow for me.", "Good performance by Portman but pretty weak movie. I kept looking at my watch which is never a good sign. When they first showed glimpses of the assassination, I was happy that they decided to not get exploitive then near the end they decided to go really graphic which was a shame. 4/10", "I just saw this film and, to be honest, hated it. I found Jackie to be unlikable both before and after the assassination. Maybe Portman did a good job imitating her; that doesn't make the movie any better.\n\nVery little of what was happening in the movie interested me. I didn't care to see what happened next. I didn't find myself emotionally involved. The movie just made me think about death, but it's easy to be morbid.\n\nThe person who scored the movie did an excellent job. ", "Look, I'm all for an intoxicating Portman-led character piece, but the history - and the contemplation of it - in *Jackie* is laced with eye-rolling digressions and odd, hammerhead structural issues. If anything truly shines (besides Portman, of course), it's Mica Levi's chilled, honorable score, although even that fully runs out of steam by exploring its climatic rhythms before the first frame burns brightly on the screen, settling for shallow repetition and cyclical motifs instead. A missed opportunity precisely because its visceral outlook on grief should've been expanded upon rather than shown through scattered, constructed fragments, and to think such a topic could be fully covered via a boring, obvious framing device is even more of a head-scratcher. Not really recommended unless you appreciate a little \"hey, look at me, I'm art!\" in your typical biopic soup.", "Unlike most people here I thought the music was heavy handed and very distracting.  The film might have made the bottom of my top ten but the music and the very artificial plot structure knocked it off my list.", "This movie has no direction. There's no point to it.

After seeing the movie and looking at this poster it reminded me of a promotional flyer for a boxing match, and that kind of is a good metaphor for this movie. It's essentially Denzel and Viola acting at each other for 2 hours in a house. But it's absolutely stellar and compelling acting. The \"What law says I have to like you\" and \"I was standing with you\" monologues literally gave me chills. Highly recommend this film to anyone that appreciates good acting or finely crafted stories.", "Love the acting, it's really strong. Some great monologues and the first 20 minutes or so at home is when the dialogue really flies crisply between characters. Lots of baseball too for a big fan was nice.\nHowever, I felt like there was nothing cinematic about this whatsoever.

There's the great scene with Viola Davis yelling at him, then there's the great scene of Denzel's friend basically leaving him, but we don't get that final confrontation of the Son sticking it to his Dad.

My father put up fences between himself and his children, yet instilling them with the best parts of him in the end, just like Viola Davis had said about Denzel.\n\nSure there were some rough parts, being an adaptation from the stage, but the quality brought out by all the actors in the movie were phenomenal and deserve praise.

In particular, Rose's monologue (\"I been right here with you!\") spoke not only to the sacrifice of marriage in general but actually forced the audience, like Troy, to realize that there just wasn't any consideration of a woman's dreams or desires (above and beyond marriage). You're thinking of the story, the struggle, from Troy's perspective, his lament of his great unfulfilled potential as a result of poverty and marginalization until you're forced to see that, even though Rose bears the same burdens, her personal tragedy isn't as obvious because a woman's potential was simply not considered or valued. I think that Rose's enduring commitment and love made her a living reminder of Troy's 'soft' side and the primary reason that his children could forgive his flaws/failings.

I think I liked it or at least was entertained by it, but I can't help but think this just wasn't translated to screen well. It was just monologue after monologue and Denzel made the strange choice to zoom in on the actors face during every emotional monologue. It is really distracting looking at Viola Davis' round, sobbing face take up the whole screen. Also it felt like every monologue went on just a little too long which I think works in a play because they are playing to the audience but in a movie it just dragged some of the scenes.\n\nThe acting was good but the film was clearly a vehicle for those Oscar highlight reel moments so it almost felt cheap and unauthentic. I really liked Denzel in it for the most part but at the same time we watched him go on and on for so much of the movie it almost felt like his overall performance was saturated, I think less could have been more.\n\nA great point of reference to show they should have cleaned up the play a bit to put on screen (which to be fair may have been out of the question) was the last scene when they are singing the song. It just sort of dragged, felt really forced, and again the camera was zoomed uncomfortably close to the actors. That scene actually got laughs from the audience I saw it with.

Thought they did a really great job and gave me a lot of insights into what an impact the state of the world had on those families, like a deep rooted sadness into their genes.

The cast was great and I think they gave credible performances, and I liked some of the gags.  It wasn't as bad as the metacritic score indicated, but I wouldn't watch this again.

The best films take you to another place for a while. Passengers does this neatly, with elegance and charm. Make no mistake, this is a love-letter to authentic science fiction masquerading as a big-budget star vehicle.\n\nThe scifi orthodoxy may find fault with the lightly-handled technology questions, everyone else will settle in to enjoy the ride. Jon Spaihts, straight off his success as the writer of Prometheus and Doctor Strange, knocks it out of the park by taking an otherwise tired \u2018what if you were the only human alive\u2019 trope and using the natural charm of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence to breathe fresh new life into the concept.\n\nThat\u2019s one thing that Passengers does well: blending concept with character, ideas with action. Chris Pratt pulls a great turn in the first act, playing the outer space version of Tom Hanks in Castaway. Then, with the help of amiable android bartender, Michael Sheen, he dives headlong into several\u2019what-if\u2019 survival scenarios you pray never happen to you. \n\nThe chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence approaches Bogey / Bacall levels of critical mass. Even as they muster the courage to save the day, both characters wrestle with the baggage of impossible choices and unforgivable sins. Morten Tyldum uses the talent he displayed in \u2018The Imitation Game\u2018 to pull tremendous amounts of gravitas from Pratt and Lawrence. Everyone is completely invested in their roles and comfortable in the skin of the story.\n\nPassengers is chock-full of stunning galaxy-sweeping visuals that line up neatly with quirky, human moments. Fishburne and Sheen supply the emotional core of the movie, driving the \u2018To err is human, to forgive, divine\u2019 message home with everything except a jackhammer. The quiet genius of Passengers comes through how it takes otherwise disposable roles and makes them indispensable. Those characters give Lawrence and Pratt \u2013 and us \u2013 a chance to view the universe we\u2019re trapped in through wiser eyes. By the time the credits roll, we\u2019re thoroughly pleased and entertained.\n\nPassengers is a rare treat in the modern landscape of science fiction. It\u2019s a one-off, a non-franchise, a movie that takes interesting concepts out to play for a few hours and then puts then back in the box in better condition than they were found in. We haven\u2019t seen movies like this in a while, but in a world where the outside world is looking more and more like a sci-fi dystopia, it\u2019s a welcome tonic. People need the ability to escape from the bad scaries creeping across our TV screens, and Passengers does this for us. In closing, go see it; it does not disappoint. Passengers may not be the best sci-fi film you\u2019ve ever seen, but it\u2019s a perfect movie.", "I thought for sure there would be a twist where the company was actually just jettisoning these people into space and killing them all while pocketing the money, and there is in fact really no Homestead II.

I appreciated the production design, and the effects were top notch. \n\nA lot of the criticism seems to revolve around the fact that Pratt's character did something reprehensible--something beyond forgiveness.

Or, have it be a psychological thriller where after J Law wakes up Chris Pratt just keeps doing creepier and creepier things, and one or both of them end up insane in the end.

No ship of this caliber wouldn't have 2-3 backup computers that would automatically take over should one become damaged etc.\n\nFinally any systems that critical to the ships successful completion of the mission would also be heavily shielded from any kind of catastrophic damage.

This is where the film most falters, and had they spent more time digging into Aurora's reaction and their shifting relationship, it would have been a no-issue scenario for me.\n\n3. Interestingly enough, in the original script(s), when it was still Keanu and Rachel, they spent more time in act two dealing with the above.\n\n4. Also interesting, the \"ship in danger\" subplot was treated as a twist that came only in the last twenty pages (we never saw an asteroid hit the craft). This is perhaps because the budget was lower.\n\n5. Overall, I'd call this a pretty decent film (that could have been way better without last minute studio rewrites). IMO, critics are being unfairly harsh because of its subject matter.", "Seems like most people generally enjoyed it. I did too.\n\nI thought there would be a greater mystery but it turns out it was environmental damage that \"couldn't happen\". Chris pratt waking up was not for a reason. It was a malfunction. All because of the company's stupidity or arrogance, thinking that nothing could happen.\n\nAll they needed was a machine (or a few) that can put people back into cryo. When serious things happen, the ship wakes specific crew up. They can then go back to sleep. If chris pratt was a gardener, they would be doomed (and jlaw would never have been woken). \n\nThe ship should be able to scan for damage of any kind. If the reactor computer is taken offline, then obviously this is a top priority to fix. Instead, it just shows warnings to a non-existent crew.\n\nWe then find out the autodoc can (presumably) put someone back to sleep. Well why is there only one autodoc for a 5000 person ship? It should have a mini hospital, they are awake for 4 months still. What if natural disasters wreck the colony and the ship needs to treat people? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyway, still enjoyed it. That is all just background stuff. At the start, I was thinking of pandorum and dead space. Imagining necromorphs hidden onboard or something sinister. Or maybe someone suffered from 'pandorum' and doomed the ship, but made chris pratt wake up for some twisted game. \n\nIf you haven't seen pandorum, it's a condition where someone baiscally goes crazy in space. The story used to illustrate it was a high ranking crew locking everyone in pods and launching the entire ship's pods into space. ", "First off, thought it was a good movie, despite the poor reviews. I enjoyed watching it.\n\nHowever, it is kind of ridiculous to think that there would be only one. Later Jim even said, \"they have spares for everything.\" yet they don't have a spare autodoc? Or even spare parts for it that he could possibly rig to one of the hibernation beds?\n\nGus made it seem like the crew did multiple of these trips in their life \"too many hibernation\". How did they get back to sleep after dropping off passengers on the new planet? Combined with Aurora's plan to fly back to earth in a year, it seems like either the ship would have to have the facilities to put people into hibernation or i guess maybe colony they arrive at would.\n\nThe lack of fail safe in the computer system is also mind boggling. You have a complex computer system that has to run for over 100 years, that doesn't have an automatic, \"wake the engineers\" alarm when something falls out of repair capability?\n\nArthur was pretty cool as a character, I am glad they were able to fix him.", "Towards the end I was expecting Jim to die. Then Aurora would have to decide if she would wake someone else or be lonely like he was. ", "I've heard quite a few people say this movie has a shitload of plot holes. I saw it after smoking some green, can someone point them out to me please?", "A little late since I just saw it the other night,  but my $0.02 anyway:\n\nI liked this movie very much. It was flawed, to be sure, but very enjoyable. Loved Pratt and Lawrence, the visuals were beautiful, the performances believable. \n\nI usually don't read reviews until after I've seen a movie. The thing that surprised me from the negative reviews was how many of them wanted it to be darker with a not-as-happy ending. Or how the action sequences somehow \"cheapened\" the film. I had no issues with either of those things. One review even criticized the external design of the ship (which I thought was gorgeous.)\n\nHowever, some of the logistics puzzled me. The mere fact that the journey takes 120 years opens up all kinds of complications. We don't know how long into the future this is taking place, but still the questions remain. For instance, I'm willing to go with the theory that the colony is going to be built from scratch (which explains the need for builders, mechanics, etc.), but how are they even sure the planet is habitable? Figuring it would take 120 years for an advance team to arrive, and another 60 for any communication to get back to earth (assuming communications travel at SOL), 180 years is a long time for any corporation to wait for an answer that an entire business decision hinges on. Also, Aurora mentions that she's going to live on Homestead 2 for a year and then go back. I can't imagine that there would be any return trips; they certainly wouldn't be cost-effective no matter how many quadrillion dollars they made on the last colony (a separate issue I won't get into at this time.)\n\nSounds nitpicky, I know, but this is how I judge a sci-fi movie set in a possible future. Again, I really enjoyed it; just wondering about the feasibility of it all.", "I just went and saw this and found it perfectly enjoyable. As I've seen a few commenters here mention, I don't think a lot of critics are seeing the film for what it is: a perfectly enjoyable blockbuster. I only go to theaters a few times a year and it's usually just to get away for a few hours to enjoy some popcorn and cool special effects; i save the well drawn out character dramas for the small screen. This movie was perfect for that. \n\nAs for the moral outrage regarding Jim's decision and Aurora's subsequent Stockholm-syndrome acceptance\u2014i don't really get it. Sure, it was immoral to wake her up but I don't understanding criticizing the movie for it; the whole decision was central to the plot both before, during and after it was made and I felt its implications and results were developed enough throughout. I thought Jim was a morally ambiguous character (at best and worst) who made an unfortunate decision. I think this is pretty interesting character development and it's a bit petty to criticize a film for exploring it. Yes, the morality could have been nuanced more by taking the story in a number of different directions, but in the end it was just a perfectly fine movie. ", "I was curious why they do not keep a skeleton crew alive the whole time.  Didn't they say there was about 250 crew or something. Keeping 2 crew alive for a year then swapping to next pair that would work out to be about 240 specialised crew required.  I know a lot of the crew wouldn't be qualified but as they make billions, they could have dedicated ship engineering crew.", "Did anyone make the connection that Sleeping Beauty's name is also Aurora???", "Why couldn't they alternate hibernating in the autodoc (with some overlap here and there to ward off loneliness) so they'd both only end up 44ish years older when the ship arrived? Surely if they had time together to look forward to and the thought that they wouldn't certainly be dead by the time the ship arrived they could have handled it more easily. \n\nWhy the hell was there only one autodoc? They could have produced the same conflict if there were a bunch of autodocs (which would make sense for a ship with 5200+ people onboard) but the suspended animation could only be activated from the outside. Having only 1 for the whole ship made that problem (do I sleep for 88 years or live and die on this ship?) even more stupid.\n\nAnd as someone else pointed out, that I hadn't thought of, why would there be a return trip to earth happening a year after they landed? There is zero reason for a return trip, especially that soon.", "I'm curious if Jim ever got a reply back from earth. He message and reply was said to only take 55 years.\n\nThat can be what the second movie is about, the customer service agent who sees the message about the impossible malfunction and the corporate execs trying erase it and him. ", "I had heard that some women were upset with the movie since it seemed to be legitimating a guy ruining a woman's life for his own benefit, and the woman succumbing to Stockholm syndrome. I think one way they could have avoided that is to have switched the gender roles: make Jennifer's character wake up first, and have her wake up Pratt's character. Then I think some of the film's message about fate and forgiveness might have shown through better.", "So I am getting more sophisticated in my movie analysis (i.e. Suicide squad is not good just because there was action and explosions) but I honestly doubt get the hate and negative reviews this movie is getting. The cinematography was really good. It set up a future universe that I am really interested in and would love to know more about it. Pratts character was in a dire situation that we haven't seen since I am Legend, arguably it was more intense because civilization is there he just can't reach it. Yea this could have been really good a phsycological thriller, but they couldn't go that route for obvious reasons. Besides why focus on what it could've been when it was good the way it was. I would give in 7/10 and certainly would see a sequel set in the same universe surrounding different characters.", "Question: Obviously the general consensus among movie goers is that this film is *much* better than how film critics reviewed it. So how is it that the movie critics can get the quality of this film so wrong?", "Jim totally should have been fried in milliseconds at the end", "This is really minor but I wonder how they spaced it out so that 5000 people didn't get the intro message st the same time. That would have been annoying. \n\nAlso, I was really expecting to see children running around somewhere in the last scene. Kind of disappointing, especially when t jumped to the funky credits music killing the awe of the moment. ", "I enjoyed it. But I couldn't help but be disappointed by the film since I read the screenplay a couple years ago and it was bit darker and sci fi in tone than the film. It really had a bittersweet ending in the script, instead of the upbeat tone of the film. Plus, Pratt's character was less of a dick in the script.\n\nIt was a cool story. Andy Garcia was really there just so they could flash his face in the trailer and act like he had a real role. Him and Fishburne were wasted.\n\nMovie had hotter love scenes than 50 Shades of Grey and this was a PG13 film. Really liked the scene where the gravity shifts while Lawrence is in the pool, that was cool to watch.", "This was pretty good.", "Why was there only 1 autodoc for a ship that has 5000+ passengers?", "This movie is SO MUCH BETTER than Assassin's Creed! I had to think with this movie's morality/psychological factor and LOVED the acting in this movie, as well as fascinated by the imagination of this space ship.\n\nNothing of AC was like this.", "Really liked the beginning of this movie, but for me once aurora woke and it changed tones into a rom com I started to lose interest, and I was really annoyed by the final act. \nTo me the movie is taken from a mediocre/ slightly enjoyable movie- to just not a good one, and one I wouldn't want to see again in the final act. The final act suffers from a generic Hollywood action ending littered with incredibly cheesy dialogue, and stupid, predictable moments. It felt like the filmmakers were checking off a list of cliches in the last 30 ish minutes of the movie\n\n- oh they managed to replace broken part, but it didn't work!\n- they gotta vent heat, but it doesn't work either!\n- now he has to go into space to open the door, and surprise surprise it won't stay open without him having to sacrifice himself.\n- he manages to survive the fire and is floating in space, what a shocker that aurora goes to get him, and her tether leaves her just out of reach of him for a moment.\nEtc, etc. people who watched it know how predictable and stupid this is\n\nI will give props to the visuals, and pratts acting. Those are about the only positive things I can really say about the movie.", "My [opinion on Laurence Fishburne role](http://i.imgur.com/B9qLM5h.jpg), sorry for the meme", "5000 people plus crew and only 1 autodoc and none in storage and no way to build one? Really? ", "I liked it. Thought it was a fun sci fi flick with some romance. Critics, as always, are silly, especially that Vox reviewer. C'mon.\n\nI'd love to know if they decided to have any kids. That would be an interesting angle for the future if they choose to go there. Growing up in space and trying to integrate with the crew when they wake up.", "Love it! I really do dig the scene when [the gravity was switched off and the water started to float.](#spoiler)", "ONE bar for 5000 people?

She chose the \"defibrillation\" option in the medical chamber, and you can't defibrillate something that isn't fibrillating.  Hollywood magic isn't real, you can't shock a still heart into beating again.  You can only shock an unorganized rhythm, and I HIGHLY doubt he was in Vfib when she got to him.

Could have been anyone, ends up being Pratt.", "I think best case scenario would be Aurora staying with Jim until she was maybe 50 or 60. That's a solid 20-30 years together. She could have gone to sleep and woke up on Homestead II. There is plenty of life to live after 50. ", "I just got back from seeing this film for the first time and had to put in my two cents. I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I left the theatre and began to really analyze the whole film itself, I found myself beginning to really love it. The plot line was interesting, yet simple (not to mention visually stunning). Some bullet points:\n\n\u2022 I have read the bit of controversy that surrounds the whole \"Jim is the one to wake up Aurora\" scenario, and have to say this: 89 years is a painfully LONG time to spend completely and utterly by yourself; so, in that sense, I can totally understand WHY he chose to wake her up, and I'd go as far as to say I think the majority of people would have eventually done the same thing. I'm not saying it's right, but humanity is indeed flawed, imperfect, and a bit selfish, so it was realistic to see Jim do a \"selfish\" thing so that he wouldn't be lonely anymore. It was also understandable to see him pick a woman, someone he knew he could love, rather than just another stranger who he couldn't grow close to. \n\n\u2022Loved Arthur! He was lots of fun. I didn't quite understand at first why he told Aurora Jim's secret, but then I figured it was because he either misunderstood Jim when he said there \"was no secrets\" between the two of them, or that he was malfunctioning. \n\n\u2022A little bummed that the whole \"mystery\" of this film was that the ship had been struck by a meteor shower. Was hoping for a little bit more exciting, but oh well. It doesn't lessen the movie to me. \n\n\u2022Laurence Fishburne was great as always. Also enjoyed the little cameo by Andy Garcia! \n\n\u2022The music was by far my favorite part of this film. So many moments had me entranced! Loved the music during Jim's first time floating in space and during his second time when he takes Aurora out to float around too. \n\n\u2022Also absolutely loved the score during all the sex/lovey scenes. I haven't heard anything like it before. I thought it fitted together flawlessly during those intimate kind of scenes. \n\n\u2022Speaking of sexy scenes, I thought Chris and Jen had phenomenal chemistry. Enjoyed seeing that electric connection throughout the film. I think the fact that they are so alike only made those kinds of scenes even more realistic. Whoever had the idea to put the two of them together in a movie needs a raise. \n\n\u2022 Can I just say I was thoroughly impressed with Chris' performance? I was expecting Jen to do great, and she did, but Chris stood out to me. I enjoyed him channeling an outer-space Tom Hanks for the first 30 minutes. \n\n-Side note: This is completely random, and I don't want to start anything by saying this, but I really think Chris should have been casted as Chris Kyle in American Sniper. He looks a hell of a lot more like Kyle than Bradley Cooper does. Just something I noticed, especially during some close-ups. \n\n\u2022The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is the ending. I really didn't like it at all. Why couldn't  we see one of their children or grandchildren step off the Avalon onto Homestead II; or why couldn't we see a video of them or something? Oh well, I guess you don't always get what you want. \n\nI'd give this movie an 8/10 and recommend it to everyone! If you love intergalactic movies and love stories, then you're bound to like this.", "I mean i didnt hate it, but i was just expecting so much more thanks to the trailer. The trailer hyped it up to be more of a dark thriller than what it was. I was expecting some sort of twisted-ness. It just dragged on and on....and the only reason Gus was there was to have an experienced passenger explain whats wrong then [fucks off](#spoiler)", "How... exactly... did a small asteroid punch through the hull of a ship designed for intergalactic travel and go on to cause the major issues with the ship? How was this never a problem for any other vessel, so little of a problem in fact that apparently there was no possible way that there could ever be an error with the pods or ship so no contingencies were planned, but happened to be what messed up *this* ship?\n\n[It was the one thing we didn't want to happen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRRw1ERj2Gc)\n\nA very dumb movie in my opinion. Entertaining visuals at times (everyone loves space), but just a bland and uninspired mess after the original concept.\n\nHell, the original concept wasn't even explored that deeply besides Chris Pratt gets bored after a year alone. Then he forgoes morals and gets infatuated with sleeping beauty (JLo) before waking her up and letting her believe she just woke up on accident. If it were some unattractive guy or someone without charm, this would have been a horror movie. But of course, after JLo finds out he woke her up, essentially screwing up her life, she gets mad but eventually forgives him in about a week. (Is this really a realistic reaction?)\n\nThey have to save the ship together, but she suddenly can't live without the guy, screams that he can't sacrifice himself, eventually accepts it, and he almost dies but not really. They're totally in a trusting relationship now, and it's going to be happily ever after.\n\nThe worst part? Somehow that ship with a crew of a dozen or so people and 5000 passengers had only ONE SINGLE AUTODOC. ***ONE.*** SO THEY WOULDN'T HIBERNATE ALONE AND DECIDED LIFE TOGETHER WAS BETTER. ***WHAT!?***\n\nGood luck if 2 people get life threatening injuries at the same time I guess. Too bad for one of them, apparently only one autodoc was necessary. Absolutely nonsensical and unnecessary to write that into the story. It would have been better if they just decided to live out some life together before deciding to hibernate.\n\nAlso, when the ship was going haywire, *the gravity would not have ceased*. The ship spins to simulate gravity, so unless it stops spinning (which they gave no indication of), the gravity would not suddenly stop.\n\nSome of the dialogue was just horrid too. \n\n>Laurence Fishburne: \"How do I look?\"\n\n>JLo: \"Magnificent.\"\n\n>He dies and with no mourning or sadness in her voice it's a blank, \"What do we do now?\"\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nAlthough, I have to admit that it was hilarious that the only black guy in the movie not only died first, but woke up with super-cancer and necrosis. Classic Hollywood.\n\nAnd finally, the romance just felt forced. The two leads are completely one-dimensional and seemingly built for the audience to project onto. Essentially no backstory for either of them and they just fell in love like it was fated (blergh).\n\nI'm afraid Hollywood just thinks everyone believes space is cool so people are going to pay to see whatever movie that uses it as a setting. Interstellar, Gravity, and The Martian at least *tried* to be smart and wrote the characters within a setting instead of building the setting around what they wanted the plot to become.\n\nI think this actually could have been an amazing thriller movie if done right. Something like *The Most Dangerous Game* in space would have been incredible to experience, but instead we just got this bland formulaic movie.\n\nEdit: \n\nAnd to add a disclaimer: You can enjoy movies even if people give it bad reviews even if your only reason was enjoyment.

Geez  ", "Everything I have read about the plot holes and \"bad science\" of passengers focuses on story elements. Nothing I have read addresses that the quoted speed of the ship is incorrect.\n\nGus states that they are travelling at 0.5c (50% light speed). This could be a constant speed or just their speed at the time during decelleration to Homestead 2; it is never mentioned either way, but im going to assume that's supposed to be cruising speed.\n\nWhen Jim sends his message, they are 30 years into the trip and have travelled 19 light years (message travels at the speed of light taking 19 years so 19 light years). That's an average speed of 0.63c. It also mentions that it would take 55 years for a reply to get back. Assuming immediate reply, that means 36 years for a reply, or 36 light years away, a difference of 17 light years over 25 years which would make the ship's speed 0.68c.\n\nAlso, the star Arcturus (or Alpha Bootes) is 36.7 light years away. Assuming that the time line has progressed 1.5 years (likely given the status of the relationship and that he spent 1 year alone), that puts their average speed at 1.17c, which is impossible with an ion drive like the Avalon had.\n\nAlso, when travelling that fast, relativistic effects should begin to happen. More than 120 years would have past by the time they arrived at Homestead 2.\n\nBarring all the theoretical physics and relativity math involved, travelling at the 0.68c I calculated above, that would mean they travelled 81.6 light years in the 120 year journey. Someone else can figure it out more accurately doing the time dilation stuff with relativity if they want, it makes my brain hurt...", "What I don't get is why Homestead was so unprepared. If the first impact with the asteroid led to a massive system failure, shouldn't the crew have been woken to fix it? Then they could have a re-hibernation system on board to put the crew back to sleep so that they can survive when they reach the colony. If life support is going to fail the crew should be woken up before it does. Even if something is \"failsafe\" there should be backup. That's why elevators have so many of systems in case of a failure.", "**1.** Mancuso's pod just conveniently opens right as critical system failures start happening?

Why are there only two suits in the spacewalking center? Why does the tether connect after the doors open? Why are people without suits on even capable of even entering the depressurization chamber? Why not just have an anti gravity chamber inside the ship instead of allowing residents to spacewalk?   \n**3.** How does Jim gain access to another person's suite without their wristband when he can only alert Aurora that he's at the door when he tries to go into her room?  \n~~**4.** If the ship is traveling at half the speed of light and Jim's body is floating untethered in outer space. Even if we amounted the entire time it took for Aurora to leave the reaction chamber, transverse to the spacewalking center, put on a suit, exit the ship, and float all the way to Jim to an extremely generous two minutes, Jim would've been already 11.2 million miles away.~~  \n~~**5.** How are Jim and Aurora able to float lazily with no forward momentum acting on them in a tethered spacewalk when their ship is travelling at half the speed of light? Be reminded that there is a depressurization chamber so they are entering actual outer space, not a controlled environment within the ship.~~  \n**6.** How are Jim and Aurora capable of looking directly at a Red Giant with no eye wear? Red Giants are two hundred times the size of our sun and have an exponentially higher luminosity, one of the highest of any star. They would most certainly go blind instantaneously from looking directly at it with no eye protection while passing by just a couple thousand miles away.  \n**7.** For Jim to have been resuscitated, Aurora would've had to pull him by his tether back to the dock, pull his body inside the depressurization chamber, get out of her suit (I don't know why she got out of her suit but she did) and take him out of his, drag his body to the infirmary, place him in the pod, do everything that we saw on-screen, all within ten minutes.  \n  \nJust a couple plot holes I got from watching it one time.  \nI really think the movie was quite bad. Everyone in the theater laughed really hard when Jim lived in the end, as it was probably the most ridiculous over-the-top bullshit recycled movie trope ever and couldn't have been more poorly and unrealistically implemented in this film. The charm emitted by Pratt and JLaw along with the visuals weren't nearly enough to mask yet another formulaic plot. This is yet another romance film where we have a main character facing a problem, meets the love of their life, wrongs them, there's a brief moment of disdain between the two characters, then Laurence Fishburne is lazily used as a blatant plot device to make the two characters work together again, realize they can't live without each other, and we even have a \"coming back to life after being dead for an unreasonable amount of time after the person trying to revive them has just given up hope\" trope. Passengers is honestly the most lazily written movie I've ever seen, utilizing only the celebrity of the two leads and the unique original concept of the film to draw people in. An infinitely better ending would've had Pratt's character actually dying. From that point on we see Aurora living out her daily routine, emotionally succumbing to loneliness the same way Pratt did, and then she herself finding someone inside a pod and being faced with the same decision as him.

While he robbed her of the choice of what to do with her life initially, him offering her the chance to take her life back is what redeems him, and grants Aurora ultimate agency and control of her fate.](#spoiler)\n\n[Thumbs up for Michael Sheen's performance as well, not entirely sure why Andy Garcia made a silent appearance at the end?](#spoiler)\n\n[Thomas Newman's score was very good, shame about the awful Imagine Dragons' song as soon as the credits roll.](#spoiler)\n\n[I watched Passengers back-to-back with Rogue One tonight at the cinema, and I would give my vote to Passengers (I didn't hate Rogue One, I just didn't find much to draw me in). Passengers is definitely not without its flaws; there were some clunkers of expository dialogue, and I felt like the <2 hour running time robbed the film of room to breathe, of letting us get lost totally in the characters' journey, but there was still enough creativity and wonder on offer to make it worth checking out.](#spoiler)", "Question:\nIf that med chamber could put them in stasis, they should of took turns using it.

I can handle a degree of creative license, but this was just ridiculous. The whole thing completely breaks down at the climax of the film.\n\nThe plasma in the fusion reactor core (which is malfunctioning) would need to be maintained at 10 keV (over 100 million degrees Celsius). Jim manages to deflect the plasma using a door as a heat shield that he managed to remove with what I assume was some sort of welder... And this reactor is overheating, but A GODDAMN DOOR IS FINE AS A HEAT SHIELD TO DEFLECT THE SUPERHEATED VENTED PLASMA???\n\nIts also a magic door with some sort of on-board propulsion too, because Jim managers to achieve acceleration in the opposite direction to his motion, simply by throwing said door into the re-started rocket engine. A DOOR THAT CAN DEFLECT SUPERHEATED PLASMA BUT GETS INSTANTLY VAPORISED BY THE ROCKET ENGINES!!\n\nAnd who designed these advanced space suits without any independent propulsion?? Seriously, they can manipulate gravity on the ship, but can't make compact thrusters for their spacesuits?? And after the heads up display locates Jim, Aurora manages to JUMP and somehow get the exact trajectory required to connect with Jim. WITHOUT GODDAMN THRUSTERS??? And how could she possibly keep hold of the tether, it's tiny and Jim was moving away at a considerable velocity??\n\nAnd when she improbably manages to get Jim back inside the ship, the medical bay wont let you resuscitate anyone without elevated security? Who was the idiot who designed the medical bay? Current portable wall-mounted defibrillators have instructions on them and can be operated by anyone, but the crazy advanced medical bay needs special overrides to do anything useful.\n\nAnd when Jim does finally get resuscitated, they then both decide to live out their lives, after they discover that they can use the medical bay to return to a state of suspended animation. With a capacity of 5000, they must have more than one medical bay. Why not just wake up one of the ships staff, and make them put you back to sleep. It's their damn responsibility to ensure the ship and passengers and ship arrive in one piece. ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU REPAIRED THE UNIMAGINABLY EXPENSIVE SHIP, AND PREVENTED A CRITICAL SYSTEMS FAILURE THAT WOULD HAVE VAPORISED EVERYTHING.\n\nThese are just the glaring problems, there are bunch of smaller more forgivable ones, but these completely broke the 4th wall and wrecked the whole film for me. Rant over.", "Why was Andy Garcia in this for literally only 1 second?", "I think it would have been smart to have a few of the pods open and the people are lying dead in them. Since Gus's pod made him sick, it would have been a realistic part for the pods to have killed some of the people on the ship.", "I wish I could have stayed in hibernation through this movie.  It's all trailer; a great premise that grabs your attention with potential completely unrealized at all in execution.  I was weary of the two leads; I've always considered both of them to have benefitted  more than they contributed to the great movies they were in, but when I caught the premise of the film I thought they perhaps finally landed in something intelligent and thoughtful.  Boy was I wrong; the writers really called it in on this with absolutely nothing risked and nothing gained.  Right from the opening scene they patronized the audience; as if it weren't enough to show several seconds of meteors bouncing off a force field to realize what was happening, they had to include the ever-present lame animation with not only the flashing words \"diverting main power to shields\" but even a green flashing arrow for those us who may have been completely unable to process what was occurring; unfortunately it didn't get any more intelligent as it went on.  The acting didn't help; both Lawrence and Pratt gave insipid performances although to be fair, the writers didn't exactly give them anything to work with.  There was no meaningful dialogue, no philosophical questioning or moral debates; this was a movie determined from the start to be yet another unmemorable \"blockbuster\" style crapshow as intellectually and emotionally fulfilling as a social sorority party.  The most interesting performance by far was by Michael Sheen whose careful expressions made his role - literally portraying an emotionless android - far more interesting than that of the leads. \n\nTo make it worse I've read after the fact that this project started as an independent project with strong interest from truly good actors, and at the last minute it was turned into yet another high budget big name crappoid.  It's a shameful waste of such an interesting premise. Despite all the potential of the main theme, the Passengers had me searching for an escape pod early.  I truly believe /r/writingprompts would have done better with it. \n\nedit: some proofing\n", "This movie was such obscene trailer-bait. I sat through the trailer twice through watching other movies, and there was a line that didn't appear in the entire film that probably drew many, if not most audiences to watch it:\n\nPratt: \"There's a *reason* we woke up early\". Cuts to ominous glance from Laurence Fishbourne. \n\nYes... the reason was explained in the first 3 minutes of the opening sequence, and later added insult was added to injury by stating it was a failed battery (or something mundane along those lines. You'd think if you can pull off interstellar travel that sort of shit would be done away with). The second reason was the opening act where he deliberately wakes up Lawrence's character. The final reason was Morpheus' pod malfunctioned and he finally woke up from the Matrix to die in space. \n\nI watched almost the entire movie waiting for the true final act - some big reveal as to why Pratt's character originally woke up. Perhaps something sinister. Homestead running an experiment using his psychosis to study how he would react? Or later seeding him with instructions to kill off certain other members? Woken up to start a mutiny/revolution against original planet Earth? Arthur being an evil corrupt Android planted by a rival company? *Anything* to explain that line. I watched the film -because- of that line, on premiere day, in VIP 3D cinema. \n\nEven up to them venting the reactor, I felt Pratt was finally going to tell Lawrence \"There's a *reason* we woke up early\" and it wouldn't be some cheesy garbage like they were meant to be together (to which her character would be justified in crowbar-ing him in the groin until it ruptures) but.... something. Even something small to resolve. Instead the line was cut from the film entirely and they build a zoo. \n\nThe film could have been so much grander, more epic in scale and more awe-inspiring if they developed that. \n\nI've already commented on the handling of his characterization - awful guy, but realistic, believable and, shit, if I were alone in space for a year and 3 weeks, I would have done the same thing. The internet white knight in me wants me to say that I would have waited longer to deliberate and might have tried more suicide attempts, and perhaps might have woken up a more *useful* -albeit- female ship-engineer companion (or several companions)...but alas, if I failed in going through with the suicide, I would have done the same thing. And so would 90% of rational, self-interested Redditors who have good futures ahead of them (young, good looking, high income potential, brand new fucking planet). \n\nThis film would have sucked even more if both their pods failed at the same time and the rest of the film's denouement remained unchanged. His morality struggle was the only thing of note - and the special effects. I would've given it 30% too except for those two key points, and I think a more appropriate rating sits closer to around a 6/10.

Every year in the next 88 years a crew member wakes up another member and let himself put back to sleep. Since there is always 1 pod less than needed it would be the perfect solution to the problem. This way 88 people lose just one year instead of a single person losing his life. \n\nAurora gets woken up together with all the other crew members, waiting for prett to wake up again. Or vice versa.

As the ship was encountering issues, it looked like it was diagnosing and fixing problems by itself..  I guess because of the damage, it wasn't able to anymore, etc..  The only two people that were \"accidentally\" woken up were a mechanic and a crew member?  How \"all knowing\" could this ship have been?  Meaning it couldn't fix that problem itself since it was physical damage as opposed to software issues or something..  Like why wouldn't several people or 50 people have woken up with an issue like that, it seemed to me that a lot more people should've woken up if it was a random ship error..", "deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9857  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/05512)", "I saw it last night with my wife. We both loved it. But we also didn't go in with many expectations. We hadn't seen the trailers or anything. We were pleasantly surprised by what we found.\n\nMy favorite things:\n\n1.

I like science fiction, my wife likes romance, and the 50/50 split here made it enjoyable to both of us.\n3. The very ending after the crew wakes up. It made me happy.

The ship was really cool as an interesting sci-fi environment (though see the following section).\n\nMy least favorite things:\n\n1. That ship made *no sense.* Why a luxury liner? Its only job is to carry sleeping passengers. Why is it shaped like that, with thin blades connected by elevators to a skinny central shaft? What a dumb shape for a spaceship. Why was the power on for everything in the ship during all 120 years of travel? How could they fail to include a way to hibernate people in the ship? I get it, all these plot holes were necessary for the story, but they're still dumb.\n2. The final events were incredibly cliche. The action-movie-clone final sequences didn't fit in with the thoughtful emotions of the rest of the movie. I'd have preferred something less expected.\n\n---\n\nFinal thought: y'all need to stop hating the movie because Jim woke up Aurora. A character did a bad thing in a movie and *that* makes you hate it? Or is it because Jim is actually a pretty nice guy overall except for that one bad thing he did? Or maybe it's because Aurora forgives him in the end?

The conversation about \"if you could strand someone on an island with you, would you\" was great, it set up a much better and more interesting concept than this movie had the guts (or brains) to follow through with.\n\nBeyond that I have really nothing nice to say about this movie.\n\n-----\n\n\nThere were numerous logical flaws:\n\n* Why was there not significantly better security on the ship? No alarm of any sort was triggered when he was using fucking heavy machinery to try to get inside the control room doors? Really? Why would a random passenger on the ship ever be able to enter the airlock without being fully secured and tethered in? Why would the ship ever allow that to happen?\n\n* All the ships AI were hyper intelligent and lifelike, but none of them could fathom possibly fathom the idea that anyone woke up too soon? Why was all the equipment (customer service kiosks, briefing videos, restaurants, etc) up and running before he even woke up if they didn't need to be for another 90 years? Would wouldn't they all be shut down?\n\n* The ship was loaded with extra reactor equipment in case something went catastrophically wrong, how convenient! It's a shame they don't have any extra cryo-sleep equipment on the entirety of the ship though, that would've made too much sense.\n\n* Jim was only able to hack doors and systems that the story felt Ike he should be be able to get through. He gets into the gold suite just fine, he's able to hack Aurora's pod just fine, he doesn't need any special access macguffins to do that for some reason. But opening the control room doors? Going back to cryo-sleep in the medbay? Even getting the fucking gold star breakfast? That was all totally out of reach with no real explanation. If he had the technological knowledge to wake up Aurora, did he really not have the knowledge to bypass the medbay system to get to the more important procedures?\n\n* Why would there be literally **one** medical pod on the entirety of the ship that contains over 5000 people?\n\n--------\n\nBut given the type of movie this is, I could totally forgive stuff like that if the characters were actually well written and developed.\n\nThere were also numerous \"so awful my theater laughed\" lines that both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence had to deliver, especially during the 3rd act:\n\n\"Space! The only thing I don't need more of!\"\n\n\"How do I look?\" \"You look magnificent.\"\n\n\"Come back to me, I can't live on the ship without you.\"\n\nAnd many more.\n\n------------\n\nJust those flaws alone would make this movie pretty bad, but what really elevates it to the next level is how fundamentally *wrong* the plot of the movie is. The entire 3rd act, not even just in execution but in concept as well, is one eye-roll after another. \n\nThe idea that 30 minutes after Aurora is on the verge of knocking Jim out in a fit of (completely justified) rage she does a total 180 and decides she loves him and nearly kills herself trying to safe his life is unforgivable. The idea that she would EVER choose to stay and spend her entire life with just Jim, a creep who essentially (as she correctly points out) murdered her, instead of going back into cryo-sleep to get to the life that the **ENTIRE MOVIE** set up that she always wanted, it's absolutely absurd. It's not just that her character is underwritten, it's more than that - her actions in the 3rd act are so nonsensical that all suspension of disbelief is lost, and you really have to wonder how not one person realized it before this movie got made. The morals and lessons this movie promotes just to ensure a happy, family friendly ending are so unintentionally reprehensible and disgusting that I left the theater with an awful taste in my mouth that I just couldn't get out. \n\nPassengers is beyond a poorly plotted forgettable sci-fi movie, it's shockingly inept film with no idea of what it's supposed to be that's sinister and unsettling in the worst possible way - unintentionally.\n\n---------\n\n2/10, if only because the first act was pretty good.

Loved the set up of seeing the system deal either the few errors on the initial day but more and more arise as time goes on. That felt believable to me and it paced the movie well. \n\n- my favourite thing about the film: Jim making the selfish (and incredibly human) decision to open Auroras pod. If they have have both woken up from the asteroid it would have felt so mediocre and clich\u00e9 to me. I love that the show him agonising over the choice, knowing its wrong, and doing it anyway. Brilliant stuff. Likewise Auroras reaction to the truth over the initial days felt brilliant and real to me. \n\n- I liked the aesthetic of the film a lot. Lots of little things I enjoyed about it. \n\nNegatives: \n\n- The big one for me is the last ten minutes. I really wish, as others have already said, that either Jim died in space, or Aurora went into the med pod for stasis. \nIn either scenario I would have loved to see them in the exact same spot as Jim earlier: alone and considering waking someone for company.

Not only will everyone she knew be dead, but so will the children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren of everyone that she ever knew. In a way, she is committing suicide. \nEarth society would have also radically changed. Just imagine what someone from the 18th century would think of the modern world. Now imagine you falling into whatever awaits humanity in 250 years, if humanity even still exists.\nI could see a terminally ill person (who isn't going to die within weeks) doing this with the hope that, upon return, they find that medical science as so dramatically evolved (as one would assume) that they would able to be cured when they return to Earth.\nThis makes me think of the novel The Forever War.

He says there is no way, no how, of rigging those mother fuckers up again to be able to put people back under, without the litany of surgical equipment and facilities and medical staff and infrastructure in place back on earth.\n\nSo... that's pretty much the glaring plot hole i thought of.\n\nhow the fuck can anyone go back to Earth if the ship can only be truly refitted and reloaded with knocked out people and shit back on earth?\n\ndon't even try and tell me they are gonna manufacture and build everything they need on Homestead II, that's an uncolonized rock that has zero refined resources or tools ready to go. even with the aid of equipment that the spaceship brought along, you cant just go and build an entire infrastructure and manufacturing plant capable of building everything you'd need for complex surgeries and procedures like that in under a year.

The last half hour or so was better than the beginning, in my opinion, with a nice range of music in different genres that I enjoyed listening to. Because of the widespread amount of stakes with the varying characters, I felt like nothing was really at stake, especially since a lot of the problems \"resolved\" themselves.

I think I was more interested in Rosita and Gunter. Heavily disliked Mike (we first see him harassing and mugging an athsmatic monkey...) and Mr. Moon (he didn't work to get that theatre, his father did, and I can't say that he's a good owner of the theatre either, with the theatre in the dumps and him not paying his hardworking stage hands. He even gets someone else to pay for his previous troubles. I don't know why we keep seeing unlikeable characters being portrayed as likes me with sad back stories. I don't think it does them justice). Meena was meh, Ash was meeeeh, Johnny was cute and it was nice to see a gentle gorilla (although the filmmakers should have probably not gone with the \"apes committing crime,\" route, because now they're facing a bit of backlash, but I'm black and didn't really care too much after observing the issue).\n\nStory was heavy but mixed up, both running into and leaning on cliches.

I think I only heard two or three songs that were new, and it was Johhny, Ash, and Meena's songs. Everything else was something I heard of before or was just popular not too long ago, or was Frank Sinatra and stood out too much.\n\nLike Secret Life of Pers, the character and setting designs compared to other animated features was a bit lackluster and unimaginative. I felt like it gave the movie a dull and generic atmosphere.\n\n\nAll in all I give it a simple 5/10. Don't regret seeing it, just the fact that I saw it in theaters.

We didn't need the big overhead shots every time he went into the Animus, we didn't need the rapid-fire camera angles during the fights, we didn't even need the cuts that went back to the Animus that had no other purpose than to just say \"btw, he's still in the Animus this whole time\". \n\nAlso, the movie never explicitly states whether the Animus is time travel or just reliving memories (the best I remember is \"Is this real?\" \"Kind of\"). So that was a little confusing as someone who's never played the games.", "I saw the movie today. A number of things bother me about the story.\nFirst, you see Aquilar being initiated. You see his Mentor cutting off his ring finger. By that time, Leonardo da Vinci had already modified the hidden blade mechanism, making that unnecessary.\nIn 1492, Ezio Auditore would have been raising serious hell among the Templars. It seemed strange that the spanish Assassins would be so weakened.\nThe movie takes place in 2016. As of 2012, Abstergo has learned how to extract the memories from the subjects' DNA, even if they were dead. They started using Samples, not Subjects. That means that if they have Aquilar's remains, they don't need Callum. Anyone from Project Legacy could have gone in the Animus and explored the memories.\nThe Templar elders threaten to terminate the Animus project. That is the exact opposite of what they do in the games, where they are using that technology to get more people under their influence. Rikkin could have replied by reminding them of Warren Vidic's work.\nRikkin tells Callum that maybe God or an ancient civilization have left behind the Apple, which is strange, because he knows exactly who left it.\nIn the movie, Abstergo is looking for The Apple of Eden. Again, if this is 2016, they already know there are several Apples. They have found a bunch of them. Desmond Miles has broken into their facilities using an Apple to rescue his father, killing Warren Vidic and Daniel Cross, two very important people in the Templar Order. They already know the Papal Staff and the Shroud of Eden, for example, are also First Civilization artifacts. The latest game hints that they are trying to use the Shroud to make Juno come back to life (it's becoming obvious that the Assassins will end up using it to bring back Desmond instead).\n\nMy point is, in this movie, everything and everyone seems to have taken several steps back. Everybody except Callum should know a lot more than they do. If this movie is supposed to tie in with the games, the timelines are all wrong. If it doesn't, then making a movie about Desmond, or Altair, or Ezio, would probably have been a better idea. Callum is not a very interesting character, not to mention that his story is kind of similar to Desmond's to begin with.", "I just saw it. I'll try to make my comments into bullets... writing this as a longtime fan of the games but started to give up with AC 3 hating Connor kenway.\n\n\nThe opening set the tone I was looking for. Intense, mysterious and they cut off the finger! Yes! \n\n\nSudden modern day rock/pop music and the bird. Exactly what I was worried about. \n\n\nWho is callum? He killed someone? Ok but.. what are his goals? I didn't get much development with him or anybody. \n\n\nSo many sweeping aerial shots with the eagle. They didn't need that many, even as a fan of the game I was pissed with the bird.\n\n\nI understand the need for the animus redesign and I was ok with it. I liked the projection stuff but don't understand how they saw anything it was all so blurry. \n\n\nToo much fucking dust\n\n\nI thought they were gonna put the sage in but no the head of security and the main past villain just look the same. Also is the head of security pro or anti assassin? I was confused. \n\n\nThe past sequences are what most people were excited about but .. nothing happened? Aguilar says next to nothing and we have no idea who he is or what he's about. Cool parkour sequences.\n\nWHY did Callum HAVE to throw his shirt off? What was the point of that? Does the animus connect at the waist wouldn't that chafe? I laughed out loud when he threw his shirt off.\n\nWas Sophia wanting revenge at the end? I don't understand, I thought she hated her dad for fucking up her work so he could get good with the templars and stealing her glory, plus doing things for the wrong reasons/Sophia knows her mom was an assassin... but she wants revenge for his death? I think I missed something. \n\n\nOverall it was okay.. I was left feeling dissatisfied and really hoping there is no sequel.

From just the movie, one might wonder what the big deal is if they're they're just good fighters who are also really good at parkour? \n\nEven with my knowledge of the games, I'm not clear on exactly what the Templars were going to do with the Apple of Eden.  Cast a spell? Build a mind control satellite?  Put something in vaccines?  \n\nMarion Cotillard is a beautiful woman and her character was apparently supposed to act at least somewhat as a honeypot (and later maybe love interest) to Callum, yet she was about as de-sexyfied as she could possibly be.

What I found interesting about the film is the real propulsive quality it has, it rarely lets down, I'd argue that the beginning is very rushed in a way, they maybe could have built up Cal a bit more, I can just imagine the suits going \"okay guys, we want to get to the Animus as fast as possible, that's what people want to see\", it feels that way, but it didn't bother me too much because it just goes with a bang. \n \nI was fully engrossed, I'm kind of surprised many critics said it didn't make any sense, because it's really simple, you can tell they made a conscious effort to make it accessible to everyone. The dialogue is very weak, they should have done another pass on that. \n \nThe second regression alone is worth the price of admission, the action is truly great, they nailed it, the period stuff is obviously the best aspect of the film, I wish the movie was longer and we'd spent more time there, but the present day stuff isn't weak, I didn't find Callum to be more thinly written of a character than most the characters in Rogue One, let's be honest here. \n \nThere's a great, very quiet, atmospheric scene between Gleeson & Fassbender, that was a nice change of pace, and then the film goes again like crazy and I dug that. The performances are solid, the score is fantastic, the cinematography is excellent (avoid 3D), I'd say there's more sheer quality filmmaking on display than in any other video game adaptation so far, maybe that doesn't mean much, but it needs to be said. \n \nI definitely want a sequel, and I can see this do better than expected, the action alone is just worth it.

Effects weren't completely done and the music was just temp music but the I was pretty impressed with the scenes that seemed to have finished effects. \n\nThe best thing about the movie is Fassbender and his scenes in the past. They were exciting to watch and the action parkour stuff was entertaining enough but that's about it. My main problem with the movie was the scenes in the present. They weren't as interesting as scenes in the past and Marion Cotillard's character came off as someone who was there for exposition. I also thought that Fassbender and Cotillard kissing at the end was out of nowhere since I didn't get the impression that they were interested in each other at all and thought that the assassins in the present weren't really well developed characters so when they died I didn't really care about them. \n\nOverall I'd give it a 5.5 - 6/10 mostly because the present was just lame to me. I did think that this was the most accurate video game movie adaptation I've seen though so there's that. \n\n The version I saw though was 90 minutes and I've heard that the movie is around 2 hours so I might see it again to see what changed but going off the critic reviews it seems that the 30 extra minutes didn't fix the problems I had with the movie.

Numerous scenes and even cuts drag on and on and on without anything plot-relevant happening, the contextualization of the flashbacks is almost completely missing (especially in the first 2 Animus sequences), and the action, bar a few moments, is serviceable rather than exciting (and the constant switching back and forth between the flashbacks and the present during the Animus sequences drove me bonkers).\n\nKurzel seems to have treated the material as a serious enterprise which I have no trouble with; it's just that the movie felt stiff and clunky, as did several of the characters. In fact, the only character I came to care about was Cotillard's Sophia Rikkin (and maybe Maria from the flashbacks). Fassbender is an oddly muted presence and has very little character build, almost to the point of being a cipher.\n\nSo, aside from Cotillard, the movie was, sadly, not really engaging.", "Not sure if anyone else is still in this thread. Was anyone else distracted by the incredibly loud out of place music? I swear every scene had at least one \"BWOOOOOOO....DOOOOOO\" whole notes in there. ", "It was disappointing, to say the least. Warcraft filled me with a bit of hope, but despite Fassbenders best efforts (damn I love him in everything), I am hopeless again.\n\nYou know, I would love a movie **adaptation** of the story of Ezio in Assassins Creed 2. A tale of revenge and learning that things are bigger than yourself. Depending on whether or not they included modern-day *yawn* \"oh lets put him into the animus\" conflicts, I could see his whole ark (2, Brotherhood, and Revelations) being a trilogy.\n\nI say adaptation, because I think in a movie, they would benefit from focusing on just Ezio and his journey, and not Desmond. \n\nWhen I saw trailers for this movie, I was less excited by the mystical prison and the puppet arm, and more excited by the actual assassin, action scenes, parkour, and fights. And that amounted to what, 30 minutes?\n\nI'm not saying this is unanimous for fans, but I've never cared all that much for the modern story line in AC. Despite it's potential, it always felt very secondhand, like it was the \"oh yeah, and a dab of sci-fi\" afterthought. The artifacts were cool, and were implemented well... In the past. Then it cut to the present and it all felt like ham-fisted bullshit for some reason (not some reason, but because Ubisoft knew that fans wanted the past, and weren't willing to invest in more story-time in the present (risk/reward). Thus, scarce progress has been made).\n\nSo, a movie adaptation about Ezio's revenge, staying in the past, or the present is only hinted at or something.

I really enjoyed it.\n\nEverything I've seen people complain about plotwise so far (in this thread at least), I think can be fairly easily explained without *too* much mental gymnastics.  A lot of complaints seem to be, to me, that people simply weren't paying close attention and maybe didn't catch all the details when watching.  Specifically, I thought it was very clear that the Animus was playing out this Cal's genetic memories and that he had no control over the situations.  It doesn't and didn't seem like an unreasonable stretch to me that someone who spent time physically reliving a memory would be able to pick up the skills from that memory in real life.  If you haven't ridden a bicycle for 10 years, it'll be awkward at first, but after a few tries (3 sessions in the Animus) you'll be pedaling with the best of them...or at least competently.  Especially if you were some champion cyclist earlier in your life.  \n\nAs for the prison guards not having weapons, prison guards IRL don't generally carry guns either.  It doesn't seem unreasonable to me that the Templars would carry guns to capture Cal's father out in the world, but wouldn't carry guns inside the facility where he is being kept.  Prisons also typically have an armory, and although the Templars had more of a museum of Creed artifacts than an armory, it didn't seem unreasonable to me that they had all this stuff nearby.  They were kept out of the reach of the prisoners during their day to day lives, and there was a very sophisticated security system in place to quell any uprising.  Similarly, modern prisons of comparable security (they generally seem to be in low security type areas) could probably be overcome if they were filled with Assassin's supercharged with the skills of their ancestors.  \n\nI only played the first Assassins Creed game when it came out, so maybe I had lower expectations than everyone else?  I realize that most of what I'm saying won't matter to people, as its pretty difficult to make someone like a movie when you have to rationalize away so many things that bothered them after the fact.  None of these things seemed inconsistent, to me, in the world the movie had created though.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of deep state politics type stuff, so that may have played a part in it as well.  Templars have a long history of deep state type conspiracies. \n\nNobody is commenting on the sort of play between ethics and free will as an underlying theme.  Maybe nobody else thought it was interesting.  Maybe they thought it was too obvious?\n\nI thought the visuals and artistic style were **great**.  I've always had a soft spot for movies with fun or interesting visuals.  Dr. Strange most recently (as an example that everyone seems to love) and Sucker Punch (as an example that everyone seemed to hate) are great examples.\n\nI'm sure most people will think of my appreciation for the movie the same way I've rolled my eyes at other peoples love for what I thought were shitty movies...but what can I say.\n\nI've seen people use Silent Hill and Prince of Persia as examples of other shitty video game movies similar to this...and I thought both of them were great as well even though I'd never played the games.  Again with the interesting visuals, but maybe I'm just the kind of person who likes shitty video game movies.  I went into Silent Hill with no prior knowledge and was fucking horrified for 2 hours.

Had everything except a soul. Wasted potential. Not the worse but definitely mediocre at best. \n\nMany of the secrets or mysteries in the franchise were explained via hours and hours of gameplay, and in the movie they tried to explain them and the whole background between templars and the creed in words, throwing terms and information at the audience via boring dialogues. There were so many things that they tried to pack into the movie, in which they perfected none. It probably also suffered from switching back and fourth between the past and the present, where the breaks between the two timeline offered no real continuation for any character development in the limited two hours runtime. One thing that I personally enjoyed in the games was finding out about the ancestors' stories (Ezio and Co), but in the movie, nothing was known about Aguilar except that he was the ancestor trying to protect the Apple of Eden. We just constantly see him running, escaping and killing templars. While in the modern era, Callum's character rested on a weak background, and his only development was to become an assassin and embracing the creed after like 7/8 of the movie was done. \n\nI think that they could have kept certain things, like Abstergo a mystery. The first instalment could probably have just begun with a mysterious scientist placing the guy into the animus, and then go on to focus mostly in the past, allowing for character development of Aguilar. This way, we can feel emotionally in sync with Aguilar, and at the same time explore the history between the two organisation and also showing the power of the Apple of Eden. The movie kept emphasizing that they were after the apple, but no one actually demonstrated the power of the artifact. My friends who did not play the game totally did not understand what the apple does. Also, the death of the female assassin (I can't even rmb her name cause she was just another minor sidekick and so underutilised) could have added so much more if the movie focused more on Aguilar. It could have just showed small cutscenes of the present and set up a second movie to explain the whole animus thingy, bleeding effect etc and continue from there after building a strong foundation and explaining things properly and interestingly to non game followers in the first movie. \n\nVideo games movie makers need to realise that the same formula that worked in games do not apply to movies, and things can be done differently in the movies to achieve better results. I'm glad that they tried to kept it similar to the game but it is not going to help the franchise survive on the big screen, so I would rather they change some stuff to spice up video game movies and break this curse of bad video game movies. \n\nEdit: and where were the guns in modern day Abstergo when the \"prison break\" occurred?", "I really enjoyed the fight scenes in this movie, but I couldn't follow it very well since it was just a motion blur quick cut fest.", "Exposition text is a massive indicator for studio interference.

It's action scenes, but not all of them, just the ones that take place in Spain....which is not a place that much time is spent in. \n\nThe rest of the time is spent on a plot that is barely there, and it's plot mechanics make 0 sense because there is no development to them, things just happen but there is no real reason to them other than \"because plot\".\n\n", "Overall thought the movie was pretty bad for all the reasons everyone else is saying (writing, characters, present day focus, bizarre ending) so I won't go into detail on them. \n\nOne of the few things this movie had going for it were the action scenes but god damn if they weren't neutered by the PG-13 rating.

If you're a fan of the games, this movie is a nice addition to the series, but those who aren't a fan or don't know anything about it probably will not enjoy it because almost nothing is explained and the whole concept seems extremely odd.\n\nI understand the bad reviews and while I won't call them unfounded or baseless, I will say that a lot of it comes from not having an understanding of the AC story but I don't think that should be a considered a failure on the movies creators parts.

And throughout the movie there would be times when they would just focus on Mia or Seb and the decision they are making (see Seb playing piano in the restaurant or Mia's final audition). Then in the final scene at the club we see how their lives could have been different together if they made different decisions. But they always start at the restaurant and end at the club.

There's many historical spots that back in the day were popular, awesome, or just part of culture or held importance. Then today those places are either closed down, torn down and replaced by a skyscraper or something else, or not valued at all. Angel's Flight was something I saw it often growing up and seeing it go up and down in the middle of the day made me want to ride it one day. It looked cool. Now it's closed (temporarily I think) and it bums me I never got to ride it. \n\nA lot of places basically require someone to claim it and take care of it, government to landmark it, or support of a group. Otherwise, it's lost forever because the general population moves and doesn't value the importance of it. That's what's happening to Jazz. That's what Seb is worried about. Jazz has an important historical impact but it's sound is being changed. Seb doesn't think it's right for traditional Jazz to die out, but no one cares because it's no one is valuing it.\n\nJust my take on that quote. It hit me hard. Was pretty deep.

Then they listen to a piano piece and imagine what could've been. But in the end it wasn't meant to be.\n\nI *personally* was very disappointed that they didn't stay together in the end. I totally understand why, and it was very reminiscent of Casablanca and An American in Paris with the bittersweet ending. The only thing I would say is Hollywood Oscar movies try to shy away from happy endings over the past few years because the \"happily ever after\" ending is considered silly. (Even La La Land mocks the idea.) BUT the movie was FULL of \"happily ever after\" events. The barista gets discovered and becomes a huge star. That doesn't happen in real life! That's silly. And grumpy losers don't get invited into popular bands. Haha. I mean there's a scene of dancing in outer space for crying out loud. There's already so much happiness and silliness and rule bending in the movie, a \"happily ever after\" ending would've worked fine. \n\nThe bittersweet ending of Casablanca works so much better because it had to be that way. Rick couldn't get with the women he loves because she was married (and the dude was a great guy), and as a couple they were so important to the war effort. In La La Land, it's like they couldn't be together.... because??? It's not even like the excuse was that Mia was too busy for a relationship (she ended up getting married anyway) or that Ryan Gosling's character had something to do that would prevent him from being in a relationship (he just played a piano lol).\n\nI thought the ending was very well done, but personally would've enjoyed a happy ending more.

I'm not really a musical person, yet I really enjoyed this movie.  A love-story musical is a recipe for being quickly dismissed as light fluff by many moviegoers, yet I really appreciated how La La Land addressed the difficulties of achieving what you want to do in life.

Anyway, I could write a lot about this movie, so I'll just share some random things I liked:  [1. starting the movie with a classic LA traffic jam that transitions into the movie's first song.  The final shot of endless cars on the expressway with a person standing on each one was major eye-candy for me.  2. I liked how the planetarium scene was one of the more dream-like parts yet was fairly low-key.  The movie saved the epic montage stuff for the epilogue near the end of the movie.  3. The scene in which Emma Stone says there is no way she's going to the major audition, and Ryan Gosling yells \"WHAT?!\"  It was probably his only outburst the entire movie, and it was great like a well-timed f-word in a PG-13 movie.  4. Emma Stone from start to finish, especially the funny bit when she playfully dances to Gosling's band's music, as well as her \"crying like a baby\" breakdown when he tells her about the big audition opportunity.  I found it surprisingly moving, and I'm glad that Gosling's reaction was both realistic and comedic.  5. The couple's arguments were realistic and not overly dramatic: showing up to each other's performances, going on tour, etc.  6. \"City of Stars\"  7. The colors   8. The balance between songs and normal scenes.  For a musical, it didn't feel like an endless stream of songs.  9.

It's about the people you meet who change you. You know that you'll always love them, and vice versa, but sometimes life gets in the way and it doesn't work out.

It starts with Seb kissing Mia completely out of the blue at the club, and goes on to depict his boss as being an upbeat guy instead of the tense man he actually was, and shows Mia performing her play in front of a full house instead of a small group. All of these changes make for an overall unrealistic and unattainable story. To me, this represents the classic, cookie cutter Hollywood movie that La La Land is not, even with the movie's nods to classic Hollywood. This overly idealized ending also could illustrate that Mia and Seb's romance was a product of convenience and timing, and not a result of the pair being \"soul mates.\"](#spoiler)", "Just saw it today, wow.

Last quarter of the movie, eyes welled up realizing that they don't end up together and then the montage of \"what could have been\" played, and the tears started rolling down (I rarely cry if that means anything). The movie made me reflect upon the reality that as one gets older you're stuck with the decisions that you've made and I often find myself looking back and thinking how different my life would be if I went a different path here and there. But life is not a Hollywood movie -- not La La Land where everything works out perfectly. For Mia and Sebastian, sometimes achieving their dream is worth more than the love they had and that's perfectly fine.

La La Land is top 30. We have someone special on our hands.\n\nTrust me, if you're game for it, you'll get swept up from the first frame. Damien Chazelle has a sense of rhythm, chemistry and drama that I'm going to compare to the best of Bob Fosse (on film). I'm kinda bracing myself for the backlash here though - there's a lot of Whiplash's DNA in La La Land. They're not cousins, they're siblings. I'm hoping that Chazelle has something else up his sleeve so he's not a one trick pony - for now, we have this cotton candy treat that makes my eyes well up and puts a lump in my throat from all its hope and bittersweetness. When the tagline says 'here's to the fools who dream,' that's exactly who the film is for.\n\nIt's destined to win Best Picture at the Oscars at this point, and I'm hoping for the biggest sweep since Slumdog Millionaire. The technical aspects are stunning - this is Goodfellas/Boogie Nights level photography.", "I have way too many positive things to say. So I'll limit it to this: I'm not that into musicals. It's not that I don't appreciate the work that goes into the choreography, or that I can't suspend disbelief when people burst into song. It's that the type of music in musicals just isn't my thing. It always seems to have this campy, overly theatrical style that I don't care for. I can usually deal with it in the context of the movie or play but let's just say you won't find me listening to the Rocky Horror or Wicked soundtracks on their own like I might with my favorite instrumental film scores. Because of that, musicals tend to drag for me even if they have a decent story. I just can't get into them like a lot of people can, because the story has to stop every few minutes for a song I'll most likely never want to listen to again. \n\nI loved every second of this movie, including and especially all the music. Every scene, every song, was pure magic. I bought the soundtrack at Barnes & Noble today during my Christmas shopping after seeing it for the first time last night. The way the themes are used to further the story is brilliant. The score is beautiful and so well-arranged, and the songs are so ridiculously catchy and infectious and full of joy you can't help but love them. [The song Emma Stone sings for her big audition scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwjalGJo7vA) gave me goosebumps in the theater. Maybe the music really is that much better than other musicals. Maybe Chazelle is just that good a director and managed to bring the songs to life onscreen like he did with the jazz pieces in Whiplash (which were great on their own, as someone who likes jazz) - seriously, that opening scene on the freeway or the dance at the observatory, holy shit this man was born to direct extended scenes based around a piece of music. But whatever the reason is, I've never felt this attached to the soundtrack of a musical before. \n\nGosling and Stone were brilliant of course. The script is a classic Hollywood romance with a nice modern twist. Great cinematography, editing, all that. But what really amazed me about this was that I went to see a musical almost solely because I loved Whiplash, expecting to be moved by the story but not the singing, and ended up humming the songs all the way home. Thank you, Justin Hurwitz. Thank you, Damien Chazelle. Thank you to everyone who made La La Land. It's a great movie that just makes you feel good inside, which is something we need right now. See it alone, see it with your girlfriend, see it with your grandparents, see it with your grouchy twentysomething friend who doesn't like musicals. Just see it!", "I absolutely loved this movie, I think it's actually better than Whiplash and that's saying something because Whiplash is such a great movie. \n\nI love the music, the bittersweet ending, the cinematography. What I think is really superb about the film is it's inventiveness and it's creativity with shot types and lighting and editing. It's hard to explain, the whole movie is just so immaculately executed and brilliantly constructed. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are both excellent in it and their chemistry is brilliant. I think what I love most about the film is the combination of reality and fantastical music numbers is balanced perfectly, it never feels contrived or abrupt, it just flows perfectly and when they float off dancing in the planetarium, you don't question it, you just go with it. I would give it 10/10.", "Here's what got me, the movie centered around an idea that following your dreams means making sacrifices and the idea of doing what makes you happy vs doing what is safe. This idea is pretty damn cliche but what this movie gets right is that it focuses on what you leave behind when you choose one thing over another. We see the two stars willing to take chances to follow their dreams but what we see through out is that they can never seem to find a way to be happy together while also being happy with themselves. So when the end rolls around and we see [that they have both achieved the dream they set out to live and they are apart the audience suddenly is filled with a sadness. This is achieved because the story focused on what we leave behind when we follow our dreams. Pursuing your passion means making sacrifices. The sacrifice they made that they didn't foresee, was each other.](#spoiler) The film ultimately asks one question of our two protagonists; \"Are they happy?\" And from here the audience questions, \"Can they be happy?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n", "I watched it twice, and I just realized what the best description of watching La La Land for me is.\n\nIt's like one's first kiss. Before I saw the movie, I heard from different people how great it is, and how I really have to try it. Everybody's doing it, it's so amazing! So I go to watch it, and when the movie is starting, my adrenalin starts to rise. Oh boy oh boy this is it, this is it! But then, at the last moment, a touch of doubt. Wait, what if it's not all it's cracked up to be? What if I won't know how to react?\n\nBut then it starts, my eyes widen, the world becomes filled with light and color and just...joy. It's a wild ride, but I just let go and enjoy it. And when it's all over, I want to do it again, this time with more attention to detail.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nSo, yeah. If you ever want to experience being kissed for the first time again, it now only costs around 10 bucks. Quite a steal.", "The movie ending hit me hard like a truck, it made me really sad. It reminds me of all the thing happened of my first love (and the only). It started off cute and fun then it took a trip to discuss dream and reality. It would've been a more joyful ending if it didnt show us the last minute of Mia waking up from dream to the reality and left us an open ending. Sebastian is of course sacrificed more and love Mia more than she does , the director was a musican and it follow the usual path of the Titanic man sacrificed himself for a woman romantic theme and i dont need to explain why. ", "This movie hit me hard as a train and like other people commenting, it relates to the struggle of an artist no matter what your passion is. I couldn't help but tear up at the end. It was good", "The chemistry between Emma and Ryan just oozes off the screen. It reminds me of a long since past relationship between me and an ex that had a similar trajectory and ending. The moment in the theater where they sneak their hands together and then lean in for the kiss... I could feel the same electricity between them that I had felt when I did the exact same thing with my ex. \n\nI hope those two continue to make films together. \n\nThis was a fantastic film and well worth the wait to see. Instant classic in my book. ", "What really gets me about this film is how it has these tributes to old Hollywood/musicals in its set pieces (someone in the crowd, another day in the sun, astaire/rogers in the dance scene, hollywood what-if sequence) combined with these wonderfully somber personal moments (the theater scene, the dinner fight, audition scene, finale)\n\nThe effect of this is making the film feel so very personal, like we're stepping into this timeless Hollywood dream. For me, (and many others), this really strikes a personal chord. \n\n\n", "Excellent movie, 10/10 deserves oscar for best picture. It was so classical!! It reminded me of Singin' in the Rain & the like!! Make more movies like this Hollywood, PLEASE!! I want MORE TAP NUMBERS!!!\n\n[BUT, it had the saddest ending ever. They both realize that their \"dreams\" weren't worth it. Basically, what I get out of this is DON'T BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE YOU LOVE BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU LOVE. Because no matter what, doing anything with that person is going to be better than doing anything without them. Sebastian made a huge mistake by not going to france. Sure, he got his club. But who's to say he wouldn't have still gotten it if he had gone to paris??? That's all I'm saying. He gave her up for nothing, and now they both have to live with it. This was the most heart-breaking ending ever. But I still loved it. Even though I hated it.](#spoiler)", "What I liked the most was no happy ending. The movie leaves you with a sense of devastated optimism, forced to accept the way life changes and further appreciate every little choice we make.\n\nThe soundtrack is really good, even if you don't think so at first. The middle part to Someone in the Crowd that repeats several times is just a PERFECT hook to serve as the the emotional theme song for the entire movie. Gosling's voice seems awkwardly deep at first, but quickly for me became irrelevant. I think this is a good example of how enthusiasm and honest passion are better than raw talent.\n\nAnyways, this movie isn't great because of any one reason. It's an old story, it's Hollywood looking romantically in a mirror, but it's just so spot on emotionally to what we all experience as human beings. The ending is perfect, a tribute to life itself.\n\nIt's not that it's such a spectacular movie, it's that it has spectacular effect. I felt like I made a lot of peace in my life just by watching. I am still in a romantic mood nearly a week later. I think people saying this is the best movie or musical they've ever seen are probably just blinded by the emotion still, but there's nothing wrong with that. Life is beautiful, even with pain, and that's what this movie celebrates so wonderfully.\n\nThere aren't really enough songs to consider this a true musical like My Fair Lady or Chicago (my personal two favorites) but all the same I've never seen a musical set in modern times that was actually good, until this one. \n\n", "I just saw this movie today and I honestly have to say, this was by far my best movie of 2016! This movie charmed the hell out of me and was able to pull off something I've really never seen in a movie which was being able to be at times a huge spectacle of a movie while, also being very quiet and reserved at others.\n\nStone and Gosling have some of the best chemistry I've seen in actors in years past and I loved how well they worked off of each other.\n\nThe soundtrack was amazing and even though I only saw it not even 6 hours ago I already have pretty much every song on my phone and have had it on repeat for ours now (I think my personal favorite is A Lovely Night, that scene was amazing.)\n\nHowever, I think my favorite thing about this movie is that on the surface it completely seems like just another musical but, if you just look a little deeper it has some really strong things to say about chasing your dreams and relationships and the fact that the two don't always intertwine. I think this movie was probably the best example I've ever seen of the quote, \"if you love something let it go.\" Sebastian easily could have not told Mia about the audition and just let her live at home with her parents and give up but, he cared about her just enough to know that she needed to achieve her goals even though he knew what that meant for their relationship. He was willing to let her chase her dreams as she had forced him to chase his and put her wellbeing and happiness before his even though he knew what would happen to them if she got the role and if that's not love, I don't know what is.   \n\nWhile I know some people hated the ending, and it is quite bittersweet, I actually found it quite refreshing. Though it was sad that they didn't end up together and I found their love story to be one of the most compelling I've ever seen, I realized, neither of them would have gotten what they truly wanted if they stayed together. It showed in the alternate reality that Seb wouldn't own a club and would instead have been still sitting with Mia watching somebody else live out his dream while Mia would still be struggling. I think it shows they needed each other to push each other and have somebody to lean on but, once they each found steady footing that initial need was lost. I think it's a great message that even though a relationship may not last, it doesn't mean you should regret it or that you never needed each other. Neither of them would have gotten where they ended up without each other, they were both just a very important part of each other's bigger story.", "Do I go back for the third time in 4 days?", "Am I the only one who thought it ran so smoothly by not having polished vocalists. I love musicals, but It felt more realstic this way. Almost like they were both talking, having a nice moment and all.. tough to explain, but hopefully some understand.\n\nEdit: Another thing, like 'Whiplash' almost everything in the film is a character.. - background, visuals, music, camera, costumes, editing, symbolism etc. I love that tbh.", "That shot in the pool blew my mind.

Loved it for all of the reasons that people are talking about, but feel like there is something important that needs to be added:\n\nI feel like many people who are artists or residents of California/Los Angeles that are claiming La La Land as \"their movie\". This movie isn't just for those people. Anyone who has had to struggle in their career for having to decide between passion and practicality will be able to deeply relate to this movie. Anyone who has had their career affect their relationship will be able to deeply relate to this movie.\n\nThe experiences in this movie are not limited to artists or Californians, it is portraying a common, universal experience in the setting of Los Angeles. So many different types of people are able to empathize with the characters on such a deep, intimate level, and that is why this movie has blown up so much, and deservedly so.\n\nTo pigeonhole this movie into being exclusively for actors, musicians, and artists is simply wrong, and a disservice to the movie.", "What I love about Damien Chazelle in this movie is how often he lets the camera linger on Emma Stone/Ryan Gosling's faces.

The score carried it behind the amazing cinematography. Never been quite a fan of Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling and I didn't even know Damien was behind this movie, but wow.

I'm a musician and performing artist, and there was so much in this movie about being an artist and performer that really hit me hard. Things like when Mia wants to quit acting because of all of the rejection and \"it hurts a little too much\" or Seb selling out... that photo shoot scene OMG. How jazz music is dying, and what are we going to do about it. When he's hired to plunk out Christmas tunes for tips but all you want to do is use your talents to express yourself.

Although it is interesting that this film and Whiplash have very similar themes: You have to sacrifice everything you have to realize your dreams. I think it's cool that with this same idea, he made two very different movies, one tense, thriller in a way, and then the other a romantic, melancholy musical. \n\nAnd this soundtrack is so good I can't stop listening to it. The dancing section of \"A Lovely night\" is so great. ", "I was totally charmed by La La Land but my overall feeling is SADNESS. I think that was a really sad movie. Even from the first scene - yeah the dreamers are dancing around full of hope - but really the lyrics are talking about these dreams and what it costs to have them - and even the song has a dark quality, a sadness. So all the way through Mia and Sebs's theme music winds its way through the movie - and it's sad and reminds us of what are we giving up to follow our dreams? And is it worth it? AND I ain't buying the ending where they give each other a little smile as if to say 'yeah, it's cool'. No way are either of them cool with the situation. What about Mia's husband? Zero chemistry with him -  so she's got her acting dream but not her happily ever after dream.

Never been able to find one that I truly enjoyed.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhat a great movie. Emma Stone was great but I thought Gosling was even greater. The movie was a perfect blend of musical, romance, drama, and ample dose of comedy (mostly coming from Gosling). Cinematography was on point. Only two things I truly didn't care for: the opening traffic jam sequence was... Eh, I dunno. Kind of unnecessary, and even more so being made to look like one take felt a little gimmicky. Also the part in the observatory where they literally float upwards and share a short dance in the cosmos. The entire movie has a whimsical, dreamy quality that still stays grounded in the surrealism to a point, but this small sequence felt too hokey in comparison. Honestly I wish they would've just done a musical number around the observatory floor or something.\n\nBut those are small gripes in comparison to how great everything else was. Stone has a much better voice than I would have anticipated; Gosling's kind of pales in comparison but it ironically works because, after all, he's a jazz piano player, not a singer. It's almost part of the charm.\n\nI really liked the choice to NOT have them end up together because if they DID end up together, it would've been way too premeditated and clich\u00e9.

I want to see it over and over and over again. [The \"old school Hollywood\" vibe is so unique to modern day movies today. The plot is such a roller coaster. **AND THE ENDING.** During the last fifteen minutes during the epilogue, my mouth was wide open, tears were flowing down my cheeks, and I was sinking further in my chair. But without this emotional ending, the movie would not have been the same. The music is BEAUTIFUL. I listen to it nonstop. It's so natural and raw yet dreamy. The cinematography is so detailed and every shot was chosen for a reason. *Especially* the first scene when it was taken with one camera. I still haven't gotten over that. The costumes are so colorful. Everything in the movie happened for a reason. Every decision was made with such detail and purpose.] (#spoiler)\n\nWhen I was watching this movie, I didn't feel like I was watching a movie.

She had me tear up a little during the audition when she's singing about her aunt. Emma Stone completely deserves any awards coming her way.

He's a jazz hipster. His discomfort when John Legend's band starts playing synthesizers in their first rehearsal is irritating. Even Miles Davis experimented with distortion and a wah-wah peddle on the Live-Evil album. (If you haven't heard it, look it up) \n\n* Neither character is defined by much more than their artistic ambitions. I don't know much about who Mia is, aside from her dreams of being a great actress like her aunt.  Even the grand conflict of the third act is centered around whether or not she'll give up her dreams. \n\n* The movie is a wish-fulfillment, struggling artist fairytale. This is never more explicit than it is in the third act. Mia is heartbroken because nobody came to and/or liked her show, so she gives up and moves home. But her moment of crisis is resolved because it turns out that a casting director was there, and she wants to give Mia an audition for a project that \"has no script and will be built around the actress.\"\n\nThe film is gorgeous, and the epilogue specifically is utterly charming. \n\nBut I didn't love it the way i had hoped I would. \n\nOf the three big \"best picture\" contenders this year, **La La Land** is likely my least favorite. \n\n", "Loved it, like the rest of you.  A couple of points of thoughts I had after leaving the movie:\n\n**Mia's cell phone**:  She seems to not be very attached to her cell phone at all, which I found to be a cool character trait for a 21st century movie.   \n\nAt first I thought it was a bit of a plot device.\n\n* she forgets about her audition\n\n* she never asks Sebastian for his number\n\n* she isn't able to text/call Sebastian to cancel the movie. \n\nBut then she *leaves her phone at home* when she goes back to Nevada.  This would be entirely unthinkable to me.  I feel like it kind of shows how caught up in the magic she actually is.  My friend thought that the casting director called Sebastian's phone looking for her, but I don't think this is the case, because he drives all the way to Nevada without calling her instead.  \n\n**Keith** (John Legend):  We know that there's a bit of animosity between him and Sebastian, and I initially thought that he was maybe the guy who ripped him off.  This clearly isn't the case, but they make a point for us to know that there is some begrudged past between the two characters.  The easy interpretation is that they represent old vs. new jazz, but does anyone think there might be a bit more depth to it?", "Primary colors! Primary colors and green are abound in this film. One thing I could say about Damian Chazelle's \"La La Land\" is that it is vivid. \"La La Land\" is about the relationship of two L.A. artists, Sebastian (Ryan Goslin) and Mia (Emma Stone), as they navigate through their careers. Chazelle tells this story through the use of musical scores, \"seasonal transitions\" (it's L.A.), and visual bliss. The audience sees how the characters feel. Sebastian and Mia's time at the observatory is an example of good visual storytelling. Both Ryan Goslin and Emma Stone are amazing in their roles. Their portrayal is very convincing and makes the audience care for their characters and their relationship. However, the music, which is a character itself in the film, really drives the film. Chazelle is no doubt a fan of Jazz, and he uses the genre to build and end Sebastian and Mia's relationship. The ending is very impactful. It highlights both Sebastian and Mia's desires to be with one another while acknowledging the price they paid for success. It is my belief that the title, \"La La Land,\" stems from the final scene. \n\nOverall, \"La La Land\" is a film that needs to be seen on either the biggest screen or 4K capable television set. It uses Jazz to tell a colorful story about two LA artists tied between their relationship and their careers. The ending is very effective, and the movie's cast is great. Again, I highly recommend this film be seen in theatres. \n\n", "Just saw it with my mom and sister.\nHoly shit man, like holy shit is this movie a masterpiece.\nI watched so many movies in the last 2 months that I was bored going to the theater this time, but extremely excited because my cousin hyped it up. I promise you that this movie will make your jaw drop, makes you smile earloop to earloop .", "finally got this movie in my city and was able to see it last night. Whiplash is in my top 5 movies of all time so I was absolutely dying waiting to see this and I thought Damien Chazelle came through again with this. the music was beautiful and flowed well through the movie. the story wasn't revolutionary or anything but it didn't need to be Gosling and Stone had such great chemistry that it worked so well. but the Cinematography and the Choreography was what stole the show. this movie was absolutely gorgeous.\n\nSome scenes that I loved that I haven't seen people talk much about include Sebastian walking Mia to her car after the party and then you realize his car was at the house the whole time and he walked with her just to talk, really loved that detail. Sebastian and Mia in the movie theater when their hands touch and they start to lean in to kiss, I think this scene was fantastic because a lot of people can relate to that feeling and wanting to be in that same situation it was really well done and I enjoyed how slow they took it. I also thought the movie was really funny and the biggest laugh from me was when Seb thought Mia blew him off at her parents house in Nevada so he drives away right as she reaches for the door, Goslings quick little \"yeah for sure\" when Mia explains she got coffee was hilarious and reminded me of how goofy and clueless his character was in the Nice Guys.\n\nand of course the scenes that everyone have been talking about were fantastic. the opening sequence was incredibly impressive and just awesome to start off with. the Observatory scene was beautiful and emotional and fun to see. but holy shit that ending sequence. as someone who wants to leave his hometown to work on his dream career but is afraid to move away and give up a \"normal life\" in pursuit of a dream, this scene fucked me up. seeing the alternate reality of what could have been and if they both could have been happy with that other life was so sad. I'm just glad that the movie ended with both Seb and Mia smiling to each other. they had to sacrifice their relationship in order to achieve their original dreams before each other and I don't know if it was necessarily worth it to them but I think they're both proud and happy for each other, which matters I think.\n\nloved the movie so much. so happy for Damien Chazelle who has now made two amazing movies in my opinion", "Anyone notice in the first third or maybe half of the movie, Mia was dressed in a spectrum of colors, blue, yellow, green, red. When things got serious, it was pretty much black and white, except for the blue top in Audition. ", "I loved it.\n\nI want to talk briefly about the ending. We see the ideal perfect fantasy life that could have been. Seb doesn't sell out by joining the Messengers and signing that deal with Keith, he makes it to her one woman show, goes with her to Paris, etc.\n\nAnd the saddest part of all to me was that even in this fantasy when they get back to LA, the club still exists. Someone else shared his dream for a revitalized jazz club where Samba and Tapas were -- he didn't *have* to stay/go on tour/follow that particular dream, because someone else would have done it anyways. He makes these sacrifices so he can one day bring jazz back to that club, and it turns out it would have come back if he'd even given up nothing at all.", "Just saw this last night. This film blew me away! It exceeded my expectations. This is an instant classic. Damien Chazelle crafted a cinematic masterpiece. I can't wait to watch this numerous more times. The music is stuck in my head. Ryan Gosling & Emma Stone had great chemistry on-screen and perfected their roles. I expect this film to win in so many of the categories it's nominated for at the Oscars. ", "Fuuuuck why didn't they get back together? I wanted a happy ending. ;(", "I really liked how they handled her dresses, blue yellow green red and it ends with black and white. I dunno why but it made so much sense that she'd have a progression like their lives had. \n\nWhat an outstanding movie, this is Grand Budapest Hotel kind of movie for me, they speak to us in their particular manner that no other movie can, loved it ", "Late to this discussion, will probably be buried. IMO, this was one of the most beautiful film to have ever grace the big screen. \n\nIn seemingly majority opinion, this movie failed in explaining to the audience why Mia and Seb did not end up happily ever after, or why the movie ended with a flashback with their love for each other.\n\nThis film... is NOT ABOUT LOVE! This film is about the/a dream, whether it be career goals or dream of love. From the intro soundtrack to the name of the movie, La La Land starts with \"Another Day of Sun\", already incorporating the feel of pursing this mystical dream in Hollywood.\nSecond song \"Someone in the Crowd\", again gives audience another sense of the infinite possibility of the world. The magic that tonight is the NIGHT! \nTwo major events in this film, one is Mia and Seb's first argument in encouraging Seb to pursue his dream... second, is the big turning point when Seb went to Mia's house and calls her immature for giving up on hers. Again, its about pursuing the \"dream\".\nI don't want to write too much so I'll point out two major moments. One is \"City of Stars\" solo by Ryan Gosling, the last line \"Or one more dream that I cannot make true?\" and Emma Stone's \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\".\nThis whole movie revolves around the beauty and pain of the dream, how seemingly we all chase and dream of what we cannot attain. That even in failure, we would all still pursue this \"dream\" again.\n\nAnd the ending... ohhhh How beautiful the ending was... it perfectly embodies the beautiful sorrow of not obtaining the \"love\" dream... a dream that we all want... I can go on and on... this movie was absolutely phenomenal. Not just your regular guy saves girl, or girl has cancer, guy gives everything he has for her. End. But a new era movie, where both men and women are equal, equally pursuing their dreams, and when they were not in the same path... they acknowledged each other's love and understood it was just another, \"Or one more dream that I cannot make true?\"", "**[Contains Spoilers - Please don't read further if you haven't seen the movie]**\n\nI couldn't help but to have a bittersweet feeling about the movie. While it seems like Sebastian and Mia are soul mates that should end up together at the end, they don't. More specifically, it seemed like Mia's decision to marry and start a family with another man was one of innocence, of inevitability, of public acceptance as queued by Sebastian's lonesome smile at the end of the movie despite the fact that they had both expressed their love for each other. It was hard for me to stomach that ending as well as people's full acceptance of it. Let me provide further context.\n\n**This is my thinking-**\n\nSebastian and Mia helped each other pursue each other's dreams - for Sebastian, it was resurrecting traditional jazz by opening his own jazz club. For Mia, it was telling stories in her unique way as an actress. Along the way, they fell in love with each other's held passion toward achieving their respective dreams. \n\nThis relationship development in the movie leads the viewers to want to believe that their mutual love for each other's passion as well as their mutual trust shown through vulnerability create a strong enough pull for both of them to stick together through any obstacle and ultimately end up together at the end of the movie. Sebastian even sacrificed his dream (temporarily) and relationship *for Mia's good, not his* - what selfless acts of love! Shouldn't this kind of love continue and endure in marriage?\n\nNot in La La Land. The pull was indeed strong enough for Sebastian (as evidenced by the dedication of his club to Mia by naming it \"Seb's\" - Mia's recommendation that Seb took out of his trust and love for Mia), but it wasn't strong enough for Mia (she ends up marrying another man). \n\nIn the end, viewers are left in a melancholic mood because they realize that the eternal love they verbally and mutually expressed to each other (\"I'll always love you\") didn't come to fruition.\n\nThis kind of story is reality for so many people - the kind of story where lovers part because the pull wasn't strong enough for one or both parties to hold on to their love throughout the passing seasons of life. I too had feelings of melancholy toward this kind of story and I was especially empathetic towards Sebastian - I know what it's like to feel empty, betrayed almost, to witness a loved one with another man after hearing the words, \"I'll always love you\" from them. \n\n**So I was left helplessly and indignantly asking the following questions:**\n\n* (1) Are people's capabilities of loving another person that weak?\n\n* (2) Which qualities of Sebastian would have prompted a strong enough pull for Mia to reserve her devotion to Sebastian until they meet again?\n\n* (3) Was Mia's marrying another person inevitable in the five years she spent apart from Sebastian?\n\t\n* (3a) Was there something selfless or loving in a person's power that *could've* been done to keep her eternal love for him?\n\n* (3b) Was there something selfless or loving in a person's power that *should've* been done to keep her eternal love for him?\n\n* (4) Which factors could have enabled Sebastian's and Mia's relationship to continue?\n\n**The following is my attempt at answering my questions, which I hope will help me and you avoid an unnecessary heartbreak that Sebastian experienced at the end of the movie upon seeing Mia:**\n\n* (1) Yes, they are weak because the human heart is fickle. The object of human love (as in the qualities people think they need in their partner) changes so frequently because we are unsure of what we really need. It might be inspiration in one season and accountability in another. For Mia, it may have solely been inspiration radiating out of Sebastian's passion in one season and (maybe) maturity to lead her and her future children in another season. Because the object of our love changes so frequently, the duration of love for a particular object or a person can be short and capability to love, weak. \n\n* (2) In order to answer this question, I need to factor in the variable of Mia's changing needs with time. If Sebastian had and showed to Mia the different qualities she needed in the different seasons of her life, I believe she would have been devoted to marrying Sebastian at the end despite the time she spent away from him.\n\n* (3) Yes, it was inevitable if her inner most need changed in the five years, and if she saw that she was able to fulfill that new inner most need with another man.\n\n* (3a) If it was necessary that her needs change as she grows as a person, then may be just one - have faith that Sebastian will have the new qualities she is looking for in her husband. Anything other than that such as calling Sebastian, moving back to LA, etc. would have prevented Sebastian from fully devoting himself to achieving his dream. While having faith could have been a selfless act, it would not have been the most wise act since Sebastian might not have actually had them and she could have missed the opportunity to find a new partner with those qualities during that time.\n\n* (3b) Perhaps, not actively look for another partner (but still be open to the possibility of pursuing a relationship with another partner if that partner, with qualities she most needs, appears). I'm not saying Mia did actively look btw.\n\n* (4) Many things - I'll only touch on three that I think are most important:\n\t\n* (4a) Unchanging inner most needs - I think this is possible only when a person has fairly matured, perhaps after they have realized that satisfaction gained from attaining worldly pursuits and obsessions, (for Sebastian and Mia, it was their dream) fades away. This factor would not have been possible to add to the movie since both of them at the point of their separation were still, to a certain degree, obsessed with achieving their dreams, (\"obsession is a young man's game\") but it's worth to mention it here for the sake of helping readers make wise calls when it comes to deciding when to seriously start dating.\n\n* (4b) Location of Mia's job - proximity to one another could have been fuel for helping keep each other's commitment to always loving one another.\n\n* (4c) Mia's continuing of dreaming for different things in the spirit of her relationship with Sebastian. I can say this only because I'm assuming that Mia's wants, needs and dreams changed while she was separated with Sebastian. If, however, Mia dreamt new dreams that she thinks Sebastian could help her achieve or that Sebastian could similarly dream, she might have been less prone to marrying another man, let alone consider seriously dating another man.\n\nAssuming the truth of these answers (especially the answer to question #4) has helped me overcome the melancholic feeling that the movie and other similar true stories have left me with as well as stomach the ending. It did so by helping me realize that Sebastian and Mia, with their scintillating chemistry, could have been the one for each other under a different set of circumstances\u2026\n\n* Had they met toward the finish line of achieving their dreams of youth (instead of during a time where they were training for their race), they would have ended up together, still being able to spur each other on and inspire each other to achieve their dreams. \n\n* Had Mia's job been in LA (even if they still decided to end the relationship while working in the same city), they would've had a better chance of ending up together since Mia would need to look no further than Sebastian if her needs had changed while training and working as an actress). \n\n* Had Mia and Sebastian possessed a unifying theme from their dreams such as expressing themselves through art to the same demographic, or serving the needs of the same group or classification of people, they might have been willing to continue their relationship despite the time it might take away from their working towards achieving their dreams because spending time with each other indirectly or directly helps them achieve their dreams. \n\t\t\nThinking this way helped me not only empathize with the characters in the movie, but also pity them and their situation. Falling in love under the circumstances that the movie has established is so inevitable. Who wouldn't fall in love with a quirky and adorable character of Mia or a captivating and passionate character of Sebastian when you're facing hardships of a similar kind? Spending time together with a person like that also builds camaraderie which also doesn't help you refrain from falling in love with that person. At the same time, I now know that, if I were Sebastian, getting over Mia after the separation might've saved a devastating heart break - the kind I think Sebastian experienced at the end (I thought the lonesome-starting/ending single-note melodies of Sebastian's piano song at the end of the movie portrayed his heartbreak).\n\nAll of this goes to say that deciding to seriously date a person you might be attracted to might better work out (assuming the scintillating chemistry - one of Sebastian and Mia - is already there) if you guys...\n\n* have complimentary goals\n* are flexible or are planning to live near each other during each other's respective pursuits of dreams \n* think you have seen and found qualities in each other that would meet the unknowable changing needs of your future *(this applies only if facing geographical separation and maturely breaking up the relationship like Mia and Sebastian did in the movie)* \n\nThe presence of the third point will help you become less romantically distracted by other people, increasing the chance for each other keep each other's devoted love for each other until the next meeting. I believe these are the circumstantial qualities that will be a strong enough pull that would enable your inner Sebastian and your inner Mia to come together and stay together in marriage at the end.\n\nLet me know your thoughts!\n", "On my third rewatch, I noticed something interesting: Mia turns off a lamp at the end of her play. She does this when she performs it for the first time in her bedroom for Sebastian, and on the night of the actual performance. However, in the final dream sequence, Mia leaves the lamp on.\n\nNow, here's the significance behind this. Consider the title of Mia's play - \"So Long, Boulder City\". Based on what we know about Mia, it can be presumed that the play is a reflection of her life (leaving home to pursue her passion for acting in Hollywood).\nGoing off of this, I believe that Mia turning off the lamp at the end of her play is symbolic of her doubts that she is meant to succeed as an actress, which foreshadows her move back home (note that Mia's interaction with the lamp is the only part of her play that we see in the movie).\n\nThe evidence to support this comes in the dream sequence, which imagines what might have happened between Mia and Sebastian, had their relationship worked out perfectly. It is in this perfect world, where Mia does not doubt herself, and her acting dreams. Therefore, the play she writes that is based on her life, is a play based on this perfect world.\n\nAnd it is in this perfect world, rather than turn the lamp off, Mia keeps it on.", "I could watch this over and over again. ", "This movie is why going to the movies used to be fun. It's been a long time since I loved a film as much as this one.", "Why this movie has a perfect ending\n\nSome of the people who I've talked to about this movie have told me that they didn't enjoy the ending, simply because [Mia and Seb don't end up together. I found the juxtaposition of the scenes five years later showing a successful Mia and her husband and Seb in his club with those of \"what could have been\" satisfied both the part of me that wanted their love to triumph and the part of me that wanted them both to be successful in achieving their dreams. This film is one that shows the tug of war between love and success, one that exposes the happy and sad realities of life, even through a fantastical lens. What I loved so much about the ending was the way that the shared \"fantasy\" gave us as audience members not a perfect \"Hollywood Ending\", but rather an alternate and just as plausible reality, one in which Mia and Sebastian stay in love and stay together, but cannot succeed in following their dreams. Mia doesn't become wildly famous as an actress, as evidenced through the smaller home and suburban life, and Seb can't open his club, shown by the mere fact that it is a different man sitting at the piano when Mia and Sebastian enter the club in the last few seconds of the \"fantasy\". This gives us as the audience the ability to make the same choice that Mia and Sebastian do, to embrace the ending of both characters achieving their dreams at the expense of love, or enjoy the fantasy in which the two can be together, without their greatest aspirations coming to fruition. Chazelle sets up this almost choice by presenting the two contrasting yet parallel realities to create an ending that is for an audience member \"conflict and compromise and very very exciting\" (Not sure if I got that quote right). The ending makes us feel as conflicted, excited, and forced to compromise as Mia and Sebastian are when we decide which fate is better, a theme emblematic of the entire film.](#spoiler)", "I've just got out the cinema and I'm totally captivated by the whole thing. The soundtrack to the palette, the cinematography, everything. Stone and Gosling were just incredible. I'm lost for words at how amazing this film is. \nAs cheesy and as typical as it sounds, no one makes films like this anymore. \nThe scene in which they're in the museum and they fly to the sky, truly captivated me, made me think back to how the old films used to be before all the serious CGI. \nThat smile between the two stars!!! That got me. Emotion wreck sat over here in the back seat. \nBest ending, leaves so many things un- answered, but don't all the best films do that????\n\n10/10", "I was basically crying for this entire movie.  There were so many beautiful moments. I hated the into scene so it started off on the wrong foot for me, and I thought I was going to hate the movie.  The moment I realized I loved it was when Seb was playing in the restaurant and you could really feel how much he truly loved music.  ", "(#spoiler)\nIts a good rainy saturday movie! \nKind of felt sad in the ending for ryan though! \nI just dont get it, why they parted ways! Why!", "I'm super late to this thread but I wanted to add my 2 cents too. I loved the transition between nostalgia and modern times. After Mia (in yellow) and Sebastian finish singing after the spring party, her phone rings. That contrast was lovely! ", "Just watched the movie and this will be a spoiler so here I go.\n\nThe ending is just brutally real! People want to debate whether it's happy or sad but in my opinion this was a love story just gone wrong. Ita bittersweet in the fact that they both achieved their dreams but at the cost of their own love. The ending was tragic and just not just because they didn't fall in love but the fact that they both looked miserable. The last look was just an indicator that \"well this sucks but it's how it's going to be\". I don't know I just didn't really like the ending. They should have made him be just a tad bit more of an asshole. \n\nA good change that would have made the ending make more since is when Sebastian takes Mia to do her final audition before making it big he should have gotten a call from his band for a prior arrangment and would not have been there when she nailed the role. This would have better transitioned into acceptance from the viewer that the couple not picking back up in there relationship was the right call.\n", "Beautiful movie. Definitely worth the wait for me. I'm going to be dragging my friends who don't even like musicals to this one, because even if you don't enjoy the song and dance, I don't think that you can deny how incredible some of those sequences were. The ending alone was absolutely breathtaking, from a visual standpoint. The use of colors and light in this movie were just unreal. (Like, why was it so great that the four girls were wearing red, green, blue, and yellow dresses at the very beginning?) \n\nI didn't actually end up crying, but the ending and surprisingly Mia's audition brought me very, very close. I echo the sentiment of some of the other people on here, as well. Miles Teller would have been just awful in the leading role. I don't see him as being nearly as likable as Gosling, and with his characterization, he has to be likable for the movie to be tolerable. I also think that there was a noticeable lack of music in the second half, but it didn't bother me too much.\n\nThe entire thing was very nostalgic, but to me it never felt too heavy-handed or pandering. This may be a controversial thing to say on this sub, but I partially agree with some reviewers who say that the whole thing is awkward for never addressing the racial aspect of jazz. I wouldn't go so far as to say that the movie is racist, but I certainly see where that complaint comes from.  Unfortunately, when you make a movie that's meant to capture the nostalgic feeling of old Hollywood, you're going to run into some of old Hollywood's pitfalls, too. \n\nAll in all, this is a movie that I think is worth seeing just for how it *looks*. Very pretty and very well put together flick. ", "Wow, favorite movie of the year. My previous favorite was *The Nice Guys*, which also stars Ryan Gosling. \n\n* Cinematography was absolutely lights out, every shot was composed beautifully and felt well thought out. That opening scene was fucking fantastic, and so was the second musical number with Mia\u2019s roommates. \n\n* Acting was good, Emma & Ryan's chemistry and charm, seen already in *Crazy, Stupid, Love*, is abundant. They did reasonably well with the singing considering they're actors first. It seemed like they had way less lines than the usual movie, but they did a great job conveying emotion without talking. Apparently Gosling actually spent a lot of time learning piano for this, which, as a piano player, is pretty legit. \n\n* I\u2019m not a big on musicals, I\u2019m watching a show right now (*Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*) and I feel like the songs don't add enough to be worthwhile, but I thought this was a great movie for people who share similarly lukewarm sentiments. The second the movie started, any reservations I had about the film were gone. \nI **loved** the soundtrack, first thing I did when I got out of the theatre was look it up and download it. I found myself smiling whenever their theme song came on in it\u2019s various renditions, and there wasn\u2019t so much singing that it distracted from the story. \n\nOther thoughts:\n\n* The anachronism took me out of the moment, especially in the beginning, like seeing all the old cars, then she has a Prius, or her iPhone. Reminded me of Archer where you don\u2019t know what decade they're in. \n\n* I have mixed feelings about the ending. I thought it did a decent job of conveying the theme of making hard sacrifices for your dream, and it feels especially relevant in this generation, with increasingly more young professionals & entrepreneurs (especially women) becoming career-oriented. On the other hand, I feel like movies are actively trying to avoid the \"Hollywood ending\", which isn't a bad thing, but I would've preferred the happy ending this time. It also rings a little hollow, because there\u2019s an overwhelming amount of people (especially the creative types in LA) who will never experience Seb/Mia's storybook success.\n\n* As someone who lives in LA, the movie left me with a bittersweet feeling. There\u2019s still that palpable sense of wonder and opportunity, and I\u2019ll definitely be re-visiting all of the filming locations. But a) traffic is soul-sucking and b) the gentrification and development of the city makes it hard to actually experience LA like a movie. Seb's line about \"It's LA, where people worship everything, but value nothing\u201d sounded a bit too edgy, but the sentiment is true. And I\u2019m saying this as someone who's bougie as fuck and loves modern development lol.\n\nOverall: 9/10, definitely see this and be ready for the feels.", "I just saw this and (with the exception of maybe Arrival) it was probably the best film I've seen in a theater for years. I was blown away by the sheer spectacle of the musical numbers while simultaneously thinking \"how in the hell did they film that?\" and they did an amazing job bringing these moments back down to earth (literally in one scene) to give the story a sense of reality. After Whiplash and now this I honestly consider Damien Chazelle the best filmmaker of his generation, seriously there were long takes in this to make Inarritu and Cuaron envious and he's still really young. Saying that I still found the ending a little bit of a downer in that although the theme of the film is about persuing your dreams the relationship between Seb and Mia felt more genuine than that and their break up seemed a little forced in order to create the melancholy ending (seriously could they not have just skyped each other for a few months?). Also a small thing I loved that I don't see mentioned yet was the forth wall breaking discussion regarding how bad movies theater's are.", "One of the best movies I've ever seen.\n\nIt was really of its time, a truly 2016 film.  It presented the baroque musical drama and the theatrics and the love without ever committing itself to it, always parodying it immediately afterwards.  There was always still a kernel of authenticity to the dream.  Absolutely refreshing and moving", "I can't get over this movie. I woke up with City of Stars in my head. I don't even know how to properly express the impression it left on me. It was just magical from start to finish. ", "So I thought the whole time that the title \"La La Land\" simply referred to Hollywood. A place where romantics chase their dreams. \n\nBut it also referred to the ending. A fantasy where they both get everything they wanted including each other. The final sequence literally took us off to La La Land ", "Saw it for the first time today, I absolutely loved this movie. I almost burst into tears when she sang the Audition song, and the last bit in the movie also made me a fair bit emotional. Also Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were better than I expected when it came to the singing, which is a plus.\n\nAlthough, I did go 'wait what' when she claimed that she wasn't as pretty. Like, hello? lmao. But yeah I loved this movie, and I'll definitely be recommending it to others.", "Finally saw it yesterday and it's just beautiful and bittersweet as can be.", "I'm super late seeing this but that ending crushed me. I guess it was realistic per se but I would've loved a happy ending. \n\nI'm seeing a lot of negative comments about the film which is interesting. While I feel it's possibly been overhyped and given people unrealistic expectations going into the film I really loved the story and the chemistry between Gosling and Stone. \n\nSure the dancing and singing weren't anything to scream home about but the music was great and I felt the movie really connects with you on an emotional level.", "Just saw this last night so kinda late to the party, but oh man, what a phenomenal film. I was hooked from start to finish, and I honestly couldn't think of a part that I disliked (maybe it was a little too fast-paced in the beginning? eh). \n\n[Also I think I understand why Mia didn't end up with Sebastian at the end. Sebastian was essentially locked into doing tours and recordings for who knows how long until he could find the money to start his club, and since Mia got the role for the movie, she would be away in Paris to film for a decently long amount of time, and then she would be off doing other movies too afterwards since the movie implied she became a successful actress. Considering that the two's relationship was already becoming a little shaky, they just didn't have time to see each other as much as they used to, and because of that it would make sense that Mia would inevitably find someone else. The ending was incredibly bittersweet and tragic, but what happened occurred as a result of the two finally achieving their dreams that they have wanted to achieve for a long time. One thing that I thought was really clever was how the alternate reality part showed that if the two stayed together, Sebastian never would have opened his club, but they would still be happy together. Considering that in reality the two looked incredibly bleak and dull although they \"technically\" achieved their dreams, it makes you think if their actual dream was to be with each other.](#spoiler)\n\nThe ending as a whole is very powerful and well done, and it adds to an already excellent movie. I already want to watch this movie again and I don't think it'll go away from me any time soon. ", "I don't care if it's a circlejerk at this point, this movie was best of the year and in my top 5 all time favorites. Good god, it's absolutely remarkable. They took a HUGE risk taking the film in the direction they did, but it was so tasteful and well done. They had SO may opportunities to cop out/sell out in story, music, or dialogue, but they stood firm with their vision until the end. I think a perfect example of this is [the ending. The final sequence in the club was so emotional and creative, and when she looked back, I was PRAYING she wouldn't run into his arms and confess her love. When she turned around after a warm smile, my heart just melted. If I wasn't on the verge of peeing myself due to refusing to leave the theater to visit the bathroom, I'd be sobbing in my seat for minutes on end.](#spoiler) \n\nThe CHEMISTRY between Gosling and Stone is extraordinary to say the least. In many modern 'romance' films, the relationship feels plastic and unrealistic. While obviously exaggerated in some ways to maintain the feel of the film, their relationship was so believable and tangible. I am not going to lie, my faith in those actors had been slightly shaken the last few years, but this redeemed them entirely and then some.\n\nI will say, however, that I wasn't a HUGE fan of the opening song. I remember looking over at my brother who sung it's praises for WEEKS and just raising my eyebrow in doubt and confusion. It felt (and I apologize for the use of this word, as it's a lazy and easy term) so millennial and unfitting with the rest of the film. I almost felt like they were going to try to sell me a Mazda or something. The second song was notably better but still a little too...I dunno, unremarkable? However, once the ending rolled around, I did develop quite an appreciation for the intro. The movie truly felt like it matured as the characters did, though I am not sure if this was intentional. I wouldn't put it past the incredible people behind this film.\n\nAll in all, this film is a rare masterpiece that I doubt we'll find again any time soon. It's a love letter to the Singing in the Rains and Holiday Inns that used to be a staple of the United States, as well as a tasteful rekindling of modern day romance films. I cannot praise this film enough. While I don't love conventional rating systems, this is an EASY 9.5/10, probably higher.", "Entered the theatre feeling happy, came out with tears caressing my cheeks as they poured past my porcelain skin. \nAffected me greatly, moved me deeply, it's been awhile since a film did this to me.\nThe tears testament to how good this film is, it struck me to the core, hit me hard. \nWhen I laughed at the humorous moments throughout the film, I roared.\nWhen I felt happy from the uplifting, energetic scenes, I was overjoyed.\nWhen I cried at the sad, heartfelt scenes, I wept as if the heartache and break, loss had been inflicted upon me. I cried so much, my lips puffed up and doubled in size like Angelina Jolie's, my green eyes became an abyss of vibrant emeralds and a headache with the beat of a pounding warhammer waged upon me (crying a lot gives me severe headaches).\nNot only did I cry for the protagonist's loss of their true love and the flashbacks of their romanticised and fantasiced \"what if,\" but also for that sensitive performance of Emma Stone during Mia's audition. The sadness in her voice, along with the story told, I was revelling in a torrent of tears as the song and its woe spoke to me deeply. \nIt made me feel. \nI felt and as I felt, I was living. As living is to feel and feeling is living. It reminded me I'm not dead inside, but I am ALIVE, not stone cold but alive with feeling and emotion. \n\nI am not one for musicals and I dislike soppy, corny love stories and romances. But for me, this film was done in a way that was neither soppy or corny. It was relateable and tasteful. None of those unnecessary rauncy, steamy window style, sandstorm, fuckstorm, fuck-me-hard-and-do-it-again scenes that makes you feel awkward when watching with other people such like family. It was simply implied in this film with more emphasis on the beauty of being in love, how magical it can make your plain world seem when you're arm in arm with that someone special. A tribute to how films used to be in the good ol' days (and no I am not old but 25), before movies became saturated with superficiality, lack of substance and depth with poor plot and story.\nSuch an elegant and emotive film. Beautiful, even despite the sad ending that'll haunt you like the ghost of your ex lover. Perhaps that's the genius of its beauty; The heartbreak you feel at the end.\n\nWatching the film, I now understand why it's titled \"LaLa Land\"....

Fuck, she didn't waste time. Is all that even possible in 5 years??\nAnd there's Seb, lingering behind, still stuck on her. \nI guess she never really forgave him enough for the harsh words he said to her when their relationship started to fray, to consider going back with him. She would've been better with him though, they were each other's true love, and he was talented and better looking than the old Colin Firth type she married.\n\n\n\nI wonder where you are,\nSomewhere distant and afar.\nDid my dream come true?\nThen why can't I find You?\nNowhere to be seen,\nOnly...when I \ndream.", "Unbelievable film...

After that moment in the film, I began to notice the jazz music playing throughout the film and it was always so distinctive when ever it was playing so you can really listen to it (which is what I think our clever director wanted to happen). But when Sebastian has gained his fame and went on tour, everytime the traditional jazz music played, it wasnt as distinctive and didnt stand out as much. And the day Seb comes home and makes a dinner for Mia, he puts on jazz music (AS BACKGROUND MUSIC) and when they have their fight scene, the jazz music is in the background, but you dont notice it. Which is what Seb said was the problem with jazz music now (that it's being played as background music only).\n\nI just thought it was a cleaver hidden theme that was put into the film :) ", "did anyone notice how Sebastian couldn't finish the last note of the song in the end?

Some think they saw one and some say it's another species. Jury's still out. Lasats were based off Ralph McQuarrie's early [concept art](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/4f209325d09a4f024c85b060/t/5149f3f2e4b0896b363324a4/1363801075320/chewoldlarge.jpg) of Wookiees\n\n* The Lasat expletive \"Karabast!\", heard often in the Rebels tv show, was heard shouted by someone on Jedha around the time of the tank attack\n\n* Galen Erso appeared to be a moisture farmer, just like Owen and Beru Lars. He could have been using the [moisture vaporators](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Moisture_vaporator) on his land for farming some other crop though. \n\n* Blue milk was on the counter in the Erso household\n\n* Warwick Davis, the guy who was Wicket the Ewok in Episode VI (among other roles in the Star Wars movies) was [this guy](http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/rogue-one-creatures-weeteef-cyubee.jpg)\n\n* [Chopper](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/C1-10P) was seen in a couple scenes on the Yavin 4 rebel base ([example](https://gfycat.com/OrangeHollowAltiplanochinchillamouse))\n\n* A call for \"General Syndulla\" was heard over the PA system at the rebel base on Yavin 4 as the Rogue One gang prepares to leave for Scarif. This could be either General Cham Syndulla or his daughter [Hera](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hera_Syndulla) if she was promoted to general between the Rebels show and Rogue One. edit: Confirmed to be Hera.\n\n* [Saw Gerrera](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Saw_Gerrera) first appeared in the Clone Wars tv show.\n\n* The [original voice](http://starwarsinterviews1.blogspot.com/2010/07/david-ankrum-voice-of-wedge-antilles.html) of [Wedge Antilles](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wedge_Antilles) can be heard as Rogue 2. Not Dennis Lawson but still cool.\n\n* [Captain Antilles](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Raymus_Antilles) (no relation to Wedge, it's a common name in the galaxy) was with Senator Organa on Yavin 4 early in the movie and on board the Tantive IV at the end where he would meet his doom to Vader in the opening scene of Episode IV.\n\n* The X-Wing pilot going by the callsign [Red Five](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Five) was seen crashing in the space battle above Scarif at the end. The Red Five callsign would later be adopted by Luke Skywalker in Episode IV.\n\n* Prequel trilogy planets [Coruscant](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Coruscant) (Jyn's flashback to when she was young and her father first worked with Krennic) and [Mustafar](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mustafar) (Vader's lava castle) appeared.

The line was said at least once in every movie so far.\n\n* [General Dodonna](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jan_Dodonna) appeared on the Yavin 4 base. He's also in the old movies and calls Leia \"Leah\" like a casual.\n\n* In case you didn't notice the CGI face, with the permission of his family estate, Peter Cushing was resurrected by the animators to reprise his role as [Grand Moff Tarkin](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wilhuff_Tarkin)\n\n* Jimmy Smits and Genevive O'Reilly returned to play their respective prequel trilogy roles of Bail Organa and Mon Mothma (an obvious one, I know, I just thought the continuity was cool to see)\n\n* Rebel pilots Red Leader and Gold Leader made appearances in both Rogue One and Episode IV. The actors looked remarkably similar and I think they used a combo of CGI and unused cockpit footage from the old movies to get this effect (I think I saw it [here](http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/794659-9-rogue-one-connections-to-the-star-wars-saga) and probably in the Star Wars or Star Wars Rebels subs).\n\n* When we first meet Donnie Yen's character [Chirrut Imwe](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chirrut_%C3%8Emwe), he says \"May the force of others be with you\" which I believe is a callback to the original line written by George Lucas in his early Star Wars drafts. It was eventually shortened to \"May the force be with you\". I'm not 100% on this but I think I remember it from reading the [graphic novelization](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20176588-the-star-wars) of the early script.\n\n* The [Ghost](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ghost), the ship of the main characters in Star Wars Rebels, can be seen in the hangar at Yavin 4 and in the space battle over Scarif.\n\n* In one of the movie's companion piece information guides, it is stated that Cassian Andor once operated as a \"Fulcrum\" agent in his rebel cell. This reference is really only interesting to watchers of the Rebels show.\n\n* Donnie Yen's Chirrut Imwe character was a member of the Guardians of the Whills who were force monks that followed the teachings of the Order of the Whills. The teachings of the Order were studied by Qui-Gon Jinn in order to achieve immortality by becoming a force ghost (and later taught to Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi). The opening crawl of the Star Wars movies was originally meant by George Lucas to be the writings of the Journal of the Whills, connecting the movies to the real world.\n\n* Two stormtroopers mention a T-15 Skyhopper being outdated. In Episode IV, Luke mentions his hobby of [bullseyeing womp rats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxVdhAJr1So) from his newer model, the T-16. (thanks to /u/machinegunsavvy for the reference)\n\n* The tank that imprisoned Jyn in the beginning was a clear descendant of the Republic tanks used in the Clone Wars ([pic of one on Kashyyyk in Episode III](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Spr8gkS57MY/UjtIc2haM9I/AAAAAAAADwY/lPZl1KAwEGo/s1600/Ambl2.jpg)) (another astute observation by /u/machinegunsavvy)\n\n* A mention was made of Operation Black Saber, likely a reference to the [Darksaber superweapon](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darksaber_(superweapon\\)), part of the development of the Death Star (changed from darksaber lightsaber). There were a ton of other operation names read by Jyn so I'm looking forward to listening more closely for more easter eggs next time I see the movie.\n\n* The [Hammerhead cruiser](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Hammerhead-class_cruiser) made its way from the tv show and video games to the big screen.\n\n* Pure speculation here but the Y-Wings played an important role in the battle over Scarif and it could be that those were the ships that the Ghost crew salvaged from the Imperial shipyard in the current season of Rebels.\n\n* C3PO and R2D2 have now been in all 8 Star Wars movie (and made appearances in the Clone Wars and Rebels tv shows).\n\n* Just an observation: Whatever Donnie Yen's martial arts specialties are, he seems to be quite proficient with the staff as he used it in Rogue One and just as badass-ly in his scene in the movie [Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeeoEpmyb2Y).\n\n* Did anyone happen to see if Darth Vader cut anyone's hand off in that awesome end scene? Someone has lost a hand in [every](http://www.starwars.com/news/every-limb-lost-in-the-star-wars-films) Star Wars movie to date (Episode VII kinda didn't do it but Kylo got his hand cut pretty bad by Rey at the end so I count it).\n\n* Observation: The movie was said to have undergone massive [reshoots](http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/03/rogue-one-reshoots) after the conclusion of principal photography and we saw that in the final cut of the movie. Two examples that come to mind right away are the shot of [Jyn and the TIE fighter](http://www.geeksofdoom.com/GoD/img/2016/09/rogue-one-e1479839870880.jpg) and when Saw Gerrera says \"...what will you become\" in his funny voice. I think the reshoots were a massive success and I couldn't see any vestiges of cutting both versions of the film together so the editing/writing/rewriting was solid. If I were to speculate, the earlier cut probably had Jyn surviving because it appears she had a [contract option](http://screenrant.com/star-wars-rogue-one-felicity-jones-sequel/) for another movie (she could just cameo in the Han Solo movie though) but Disney/Gareth Edwards had the balls to actually go through with killing EVERY ONE of the main cast members. A great call in my opinion. The stakes were real! \n\n* Another observation: I think the Vader scenes did an awesome job of acting as more of a connective tissue between the Prequels and OT. The \"choking on aspirations\" pun he said to Krennic was totally an Anakin line and his fighting style was slower but precise and brutally strong. It's a good bridge between the acrobatic finesse of the Prequels and the broadsword-like savagery of the OT. You could tell he was physically hampered from his past injuries but his style has realistically adapted to his abilities so he is still incredibly effective.\n\n* I wish we could have seen a Porkins cameo. It would have been amazing to see the big boy fuck shit up. It would have made his death in Episode IV much sadder.\n\n* I also wish Saw Gerrera would have had his own set piece before dying so we could see how badass he is.\n\n[A source I used](http://screenrant.com/star-wars-rogue-one-cameos-secrets/) (A lot of the other info was just from me firsthand because I'm obsessed with Star Wars so if any of it is wrong that's my poor recollection from only seeing the movie once so far)", "The Vader scene at the end was amazing.

It\u2019s fascinating how even though the Rogue One crew was entirely killed, the Empire still lost the Death Star plans.

For the first two acts however, I kinda forgot that it was a Star Wars film. Once the third act started and the Rebel fleet jumped in, I instantly felt a wave of nostalgic glee and I basically just turned into a kid again in the theater. Watching Vader cut down that hallway of rebels was one of the most satisfying things to see.\n\nOne thing that really stuck out to me was the lack of natural lulls in conversations.

They were morally grey - it really wouldn't be much to jump and describe as terrorists, because we can see it in action. It was an interesting perspective. \n\nAlso, excellent ending. We all knew *how* it ended, but they did it in spectacular fashion. ", "I know it might be weird to say but of all the people they brought back by far the one I was most excited about was Bail Organa (space Jimmy Smitts). He was always great in the prequels and he\u2019s such a badass in the EU. I\u2019m glad the new films might now bridge the gaps between the prequels and the OT.

As creepy as Tetsuo in Akira, but with the addition of a controlled rage that is emblematic of the dark side. The scene was short but phenomenal.", "I just watched it a little earlier today and have given myself time to calm down after that insane Vader boner. I'll try to keep my comments short but there's so much I enjoyed.\n\nI have to say I was *extremely* satisfied with Rogue One. The cinematography was good, almost beautiful at some points (a scene only a few seconds long with a squadron of x wings gliding through the gate 'ship' and seeing the turquoise planet underneath was gorgeous). The locations were all very interesting and enjoyed their varied environments. I like the opening scenes of the villains (forget his name now, Kessic?) white cape against the black sand and bright green crops. \n\nLooking back I'd say the weakest bit was the cave scene with Forest. But it was short and with that escape from the planet I had nearly all but forgotten about it.\n\nI loved how they chose to show the rebellion in a darker, more muddy light. They had to do some nasty things to survive and get the information they needed. And the scene where Jynn says goodbye to her father after he is injured from the *rebellion* attacks - very sad and makes you wonder if the\nAlliance are all that 'heroic'\n\nThe villain was top notch, he was just a bloody bastard hoping to work his way up the ranks and be the best bastard he could. His death was very good, having him look up to see his very creation (and pride) staring down at him. \n\nI also like that the last 'fight' wasn't just Jynn and Kessic duping it out like in a lot of other action movies. Those can be very dull a lot of the time.\n\nI also like how they didn't kiss at the end. There wasn't any 'romance' between them for the entire movie and trying to squeeze in a kiss would have just felt forced and odd. Instead they have a good companionship knowing together they helped give the rebellion a chance the end the empire. \n\nAll supporting characters that made up rogue one where also nicely done, had a nice few laughs from them. K2's one liners were great.\n\nBattle of Scarrif, top notch, no faults from what I can remember. Loved seeing the ATAT appear out of the smoke.\n\nAnd then the \"oh no, the star destroyer has gone down, I hope he doesn't end up bumping into the other one\" then the freaking hammer head appears - \"prepare for impact!\" \nOi boi he 'bout to do it! *smash kaboom*\n\nBut holy shit, the glistening cheery on top of that star war cake had to be the hallway scene with Vader. Just how the rebels turn to see dark, black smoke billowing out of the end of the hallway. Suddenly, the breathing starts. \"Oh shit\" you think. This is it, you can feel the pure terror in the rebel soldiers as they stare down the corridor. Then he's just illuminated entirely in the red glow of his light sabre, giving him probably the most evil appearance ever. \nThen he just utterly destroys them, making his way to the very last soldier holding the rebellions only hope! There's so much urgency. So much was sacrificed to get those plans don't fuck it up now!\n\nUgh I need to go calm down again.

It's by far the best action sequence in a Star Wars movie and on par with any big budget action setpiece I can think of.

All the other ones where a lot of fun (except I, II & III imo). But they always felt like cool fantasy/space adventures. I never felt the raw, real dread of an actual war. LotR, for example, managed to have both the fun of adventure and the horrors of war. Star Wars, to me, was always all about the adventure. \n\nRogue One however, was VERY raw. It really captured the horror of a cruel space war. They really managed to make me feel the small chance of success of the rebellion against the huge empire.

In the series, he plays the 2nd in command of the Onderon Resistance during the Clone Wars in their attempts to liberate the planet from the Sepratists. The Republic sends 3 Jedi to assist him and the resistance. Saw Gerrera fought alongside them and successfully liberated Onderon. This is episode 2 of season 5 when the story arc begins (its a 4 part story arc).\n\nIf you watch very closely, Saw's Rebels fight in the exact same manner and skirmish style against the Empire as Saw was taught to fight the separatists during the Clone Wars. Who taught him this? Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano. They are even fighting a tank in Rogue One in the exact same manner as they fought a Droid Tank in Clone Wars.\n\nThis is part of the reason why Saw is on Jedha. Saw fought alongside the Jedi and they helped him free his planet, he is on Jedha because of its close connection to the Jedi and the force. One of the reasons he fights the Empire is because of their slaughter of the Jedi; Saw was directly impacted by his experiences with the Jedi.\n\nThe Saw Gerrera we see shows someone who has been in war their entire life and he has been fighting war for over 20 years. He suffers from PTSD and has lived a life of constant loss, sacrifice, and betrayal. This is why he essentially commits suicide in the film. If you look VERY closely, he's wearing an Onderon flag as he dies. \n\nGeneral Syndulla is a name heard in Yavin 4's communications room. General Syndulla (Rebels creator has confirmed this) is in fact Hera Syundulla from Star Wars Rebels, meaning that she has survived until A New Hope and is a very influential figure in the Rebellion.\n\nChopper! Hera's quirky droid companion is also seen in Rogue One with his iconic sound. He appears when the rebel comm person runs out of the temple to talk to Mon Montha; he can be seen rolling away on the left side of the screen.\n\nVCX-100. This Corellian Light Freighter is seen in the Battle of Scarif and is in fact *Ghost*, the main ship from Star Wars Rebels. It is the Ghost as its designation is called out over the speakers, though that is no indication that the crew is still alive (aside from Syndulla and Chopper).\n\nCommander Sato's CR-90 Blue Corellian Corvette *The Liberator* is also seen in several shots in the space battle and is also taken from Star Wars Rebels, representing that Phoenix Squadron has joined the larger rebellion.\n\nThe Hammerhead Cruisers, first seen in KOTOR, then re canonized in Star Wars Rebels are actually from Rebels. An episode in Rebels shows the rebellion stealing them from the Imperials with the assistance of Princess Leia. The Hammerhead is distinctly shown when it pushes the disabled Star Destroyer into another Star Destroyer.\n\nThe first stormtrooper that we hear in the prison transport that Jan is on is clearly Steve Blum. Steve Blum is the voice actor of Zeb, another character from Star Wars Rebels and also voices the stormtroopers in Rebels.\n\nDuring the Battle of Scarif, Pao sees the AT-ACTs approaching the beach, he shouts \"Karabast!\" This is the favorite curse word of Zeb, a main character from Star Wars Rebels.\n\nAdmiral Raddus is voiced by the same voice actor who does Tarkin in Clone Wars and Rebels. Hera's voice actor also does several voices in the film. ", "Best Star Wars movie in 36 years. Fight me.", "don't expect most to agree, but this was -- by far -- my favorite Star Wars movie. Jyn might be my favorite protagonist. But really everything boiled down to this: The stakes just felt so much more real than any other entry. In other movies, I actually liked the Empire, mainly because of Vader, but this is the only one that made me fear Vader and the Empire, and made me root so hard for the rebellion to succeed, because I actually cared for the characters and their sacrifice. Maybe it's just the current political climate in the U.S., but I really connected with the rebellion for the first time. And that made the difference.", "Some extremely hyperbolic comments on here have me questioning whether people have actually seen a \"dark and gritty movie\". It was Star Wars, guys. There was a crab flying a space ship.", "**Pros:**\n\n* The overall feel of the movie. It felt like a dark Star Wars movie. It isn't a clear good versus evil story. Cassian straight-up murdered a dude the first time you meet him, and a rebel shortly after. Saw Gerrera is a rebel extremist who locks our heroes away. Galen Erso works for the Empire so he can take them down from the inside.\n* K-2SO is fantastic. It's nice to have a sassy droid character that doesn't just communicate in beeps.\n* Everybody dies. It needed to happen.\n* The last few minutes, especially the scene of Darth Vader kicking ass. \n\n**Cons:**\n\n* The pacing was weird. Especially during the first 30 minutes of the movie, there's a lot of planet hopping.\n* The CG for Grand Moff Tarkin. He hit the [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) for me, and I felt physically uncomfortable every time I saw his face. If his part was reduced to something more in line with Leia, or if he had communicated solely via hologram, I think it would've been fine.\n* There was a lot of fan service. Why were there AT-STs in Jedha? Why was [Cornelius Evazan](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Cornelius_Evazan) there? Seriously, why was everything in Jedha?\n* Generally, a lot of minor things. I didn't like the scene between Vader and Krennic. I'm not sure if it was the script, the delivery, or the effects, but something was wrong about Vader's voice. The names of the planets on the establishing shots seemed like lazy filmmaking, especially when their names didn't matter. I think the \"master switch\" in the middle of the battlefield was dumb.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how I feel about Rogue One. I liked it, I guess? It was definitely a movie that I watched.", "First 5 minutes: Damn this is good\n\nNext 120 minutes: Meh\n\nLast 5 minutes: HOLY FUCK THIS IS AMAZING THEY\u2019RE ALL DEAD IS THIS STILL A DISNEY MOVIE THIS IS SO VIOLENT I CAN\u2019T HANDLE THIS WAIT ARE WE GOING TO SEE YEP IT\u2019S HER OH MY GOD THIS IS PERFECT I FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIM I\u2019M NOT CRYING I\u2019M NOT CRYING", "I'm going to bring up something I haven't seen anyone mention yet.

For instance, why focus so much on Forest Whitaker's character, making him a source of conflict, when that ultimately went no where? I feel as though the movie wasn't tightly written.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I was bored the first hour-and-a-half. Things picked up during the finale, but the other problem for me is that I really didn't care about Jyn, Cassian, or the villain. They didn't have a lot of charisma. The side characters were really fun, particularly Donnie Yen and K2, but they were underused.\n\nOne problem I had with the final battle was that the goals and conflicts weren't clear. I mean, if you look at the attack on the Death Star in *Star Wars*, you knew exactly what the characters needed to do, how they needed to do it, what the stakes were, and what was preventing them from doing it. In the final battle in *Rogue One*, however, it wasn't clear what they characters needed to do or how they needed to accomplish it. They only figured out they needed to take down the shield at the very end, and we were never told how they were going to accomplish this until they actually did it. That's not a good way to build tension.\n\nI honestly think this film is weaker than *The Force Awakens*. The tone was off, the plot meandered around, and the leads didn't stand out.", "What I loved about Rogue One, apart from the very last 2 minutes, the amazing visual effects, K-2SO and the final battle, is how makes Episode IV important. \n\nLike if you really think about it \"New Hope\" begins with - these are the good guys and they are running away from the bad guys with precious information about something. It is not until Luke's uncle and aunt are murdered that you actually feel the urgency of the situation and the vital importance of what is going on.  \n\n\"Rogue One\" absolutely makes you re-watch Episode IV and be engaged from the very first minutes. Furthermore you actually cheer when the Rebels win in the end, because you watched in \"Rogue One\" how desperate they were and what sacrifices they made, not to mention the main characters, to get to that point.  \n\nAnother thing is how the Death Star in \"New Hope\" is portrayed as this massive weapon, but we see it in action for like 1 minute and we never actually feel that threatened, at least me. Yeah, it can destroy planets, but the actual realization of its enormous power comes from \"Rogue One\". And having seen it, now you can really appreciate the Death Star in a way. It is not just another weaponry of some villain. \n\nThe downside actually is that you are going from this dark war movie to this adventure family-friendly one without any of the spectacular visuals of the first, but I think to a true Star Wars fan that won't matter to him and he will be more engaged and appreciative of the story than ever, which as I said before is what I truly loved about \"Rogue One\".  ", "Is it just me or did the entire first act of the movie seem completely superfluous. \n\nThe pilot already knew where her dad was, and the dad was the one who told them where the death star plans were. Forest Whitakers character was totally pointless, and the whole arc of the pilot finding him, and the mind-flayer, and having to find him again did nothing to serve the overall plot. \n\nSo much time that could have been better speant showing us some of the characters in action or interacting. That way I'd actually care when they all inevitably die.\n\nIt was beautifully shot, and the actors put in above average performances for the franchise, but i can't help feel like it could have been more than it was. \n\nIt certainly gives me hope for future 'star ars story' films though.", "Everyone died and their deaths all had weight.

Also loved that the \"Rogue One\" callsign was not just directed at the Empire, but the Rebel Alliance too. Wonderful stuff, looking forward to more anthology movies after this.\n\nAlso, you bet your ass I'm gonna mark out for Vader \"Cyborg Ninja\"ing a hallway full of Rebel scum.", "As an IT professional, I laughed when I saw that in the star wars universe, the Imperials use a bigass storage array for their data. Even the drive with the death star data looks like a regular ol enterprise drive.", "People saying Chirrut's, Baze's and Bodhi's deaths were too fast and unemotional don't realize that that was probably the point of their deaths.

Obviously plenty of spoilers below.\n\nThe good points were the action sequences (albeit some became rather incoherent), humanising both sides of the conflict, Vader's hellish end scene, and the decision to have it truly be a suicide mission. \n\nOn the downside there were a lot of times the film set up to make a 'big moment'- like her speech to the men on the ship- which failed miserably to connect. In addition the first 20 minutes the scene changes about 10 times in such a quick fashion that it's hard to connect with anything or anyone. Finally I found the CGI Peter Cushing to be a distraction (although I actually liked the CGI Leia at the end).\n\nI get the feeling a lot of the 'ethical' problems were left on the cutting room floor and were replaced with action sequences. Surely they could have made a lot more about the fact her father was building a Death Star while still trying to be good (and the Rebels assassinate him while also trying to be good). I don't know if the film would have been improved by this however- the times such issues were touched on they didn't make too much impact.\n\nThere was a lot of footage that I don't really know why it was kept in- the whole first act up until the destruction of the city could have been cut down drastically. It was one person meeting another who wants to meet another while another person needs to be met.\n\nThat said, it's a lot easier to complain about a film than commend it. Fundamentally I walked out the cinema feeling like I had been entertained, which means I do recommend it.", "I feel that Rogue One was a much, much better overall film than Force Awakens.  It can stand on its own story and plot, rather than rely on rehashing the original New Hope.  Enjoyed Awakens, but Rogue One was just so much better.  The 3rd act was outstanding.  Easily the best space battles of the series as well.

Everything seemed so terrifyingly large; it was great. Also, that ending. I had straight up goosebumps all over my body for like 15 minutes. As soon as this movie finished I wanted to watch Episode IV immediately. \n\nI can see where people have issues with the movie, but it was amazing in my opinion. Not flawless, but damn enjoyable.

But overall: 6/10, and that\u2019s being kind. The last 45 minutes were a fun action movie that often felt like Star Wars. Preceding it was an amateur-hour first act that I actively hated, and plodding and dull second act that felt like the cut-scenes from a Rogue Squadron video game. Not sure why we needed to spend 2/3rds of the \u201chow they steal the Death Star plans\u201d movie not stealing the Death Star Plans, or even really talking about maybe stealing them, but whatever. All right, let\u2019s do this:\n\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* When they get to Scarif, it finally feels like a coherent movie with a purpose. Good action scenes, clear objectives for our heroes, dramatic tension. Whee!\n* I liked Leia\u2019s appearance. It was quick enough to avoid the Uncanny Valley. Looked like young Carrie Fisher to me.\n* While super fan service-y, Vader wrecking shop on the ship was pretty cool to watch.\n* Baze didn\u2019t have a ton of depth, but I liked his character. Jiang did the best with the material, and made the character more than what the script provided.\n* It took until they got to Scarif, but Riz Ahmed as Bohdi Rook eventually became a relatable, compelling character who rose to the occasion.\n* I feel pretty good about Jimmy Smitts getting paid. Cash those checks, Jimmy!\n* Space battle! The Hammerhead was pretty cool. Would have liked to see them pull back after they rammed the one Star Destroyer into the other one.\n* Had a nice chuckle when they literally had to climb up a column inside a chasm to reach the Death Star plans. Whoever the Imperials hired to design their bases must hate OSHA.\n\n**The Meh:**\n\n* We got to see Darth Vader\u2019s castle, I guess? Totally pointless scene, but yay more planets?\n* With a few exceptions, the main characters are dull one-dimensional cutouts. Jyn and Cassian got almost all of the attention and were so boring and generic.\n* Saw was kinda pointless and the audience just laughed when he sucked on his breath mask like it was nitrous or something. Was he supposed to be high? What was the point of that stupid squid scene? It didn\u2019t even pay off later, Saw seemingly ignored it.\n* K-2SO\u2019s sarcasm got pretty one-note after a while. It was like they had no idea how to work in a joke unless it came from the droid.\n* The was some really egregious fan service. Ponda Baba and friend: oof. The droids: oh come on. And cutting in re-used footage of Red Leader and Gold Leader from Episode IV was kind of embarrassing.\n* The attempts to make characters morally compromised was totally out of step with Star Wars. This would have been a better movie if they dropped the grimdark nonsense and just made a movie about plucky rebels stealing the Death Star plans.\n* On that point: when we finally get to stealing the Death Star plans, it\u2019s just: \u201chey, let\u2019s go to the Imperial Blueprint Archive planet! They\u2019ll have the plans!\u201d I was expecting some amount of difficulty in finding the plans, then \u201cI only hope that when the data's analyzed a weakness can be found.\u201d Instead we got: \u201cI put in backdoor. Just go get the plans from the archive planet and you\u2019ll find it.\u201d\n* They had how long to plan the ending to this and still couldn\u2019t get it to line up congruously with A New Hope? Having Leia ride out the whole battle in the Tantive IV, strapped to the side of the main Rebel ship, was just bizarre. This falls under the Certain Point of View thing for prequels, I guess. It gets hard, in retrospect, to match up \u201cRebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base\u201d and \u201cSeveral transmissions were beamed aboard this ship\u2026\u201d\n* All of Eadu was a needless diversion. It\u2019s only there to try (and fail) to give Jyn and Cassian some character development.\n* The final shot of Jyn and Cassian, we see his face not hers. Huh? Who\u2019s the lead character here? Poor form.\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n* Not a single moment where my emotion really soared in the entire film. The last act is like a really fun Star Tours ride, and a few characters start to feel like human beings, but it still can\u2019t land a punch like say Luke firing his torpedoes, the end or Empire, Luke vs Vader final fight in Jedi, Rey calling the lightsaber to her in TFA, etc.\n* Jyn having to be the one to show the Rebel Alliance how to tie their own shoes, and then force them into action, was some retconned nonsense. Totally stupid. All that to build up her character and she was still dull as dirt. Plus, you get the feeling that if they weren\u2019t trying to hit all the beats in a formula, Save the Cat-style, this scene doesn\u2019t happen.\n* Tarkin was awful. Like, Disney\u2019s Hall of Presidents animatronic bad. Just completely took me out of those scenes. I couldn\u2019t even focus on the dialog because Tarkin was so jarring. And they kept coming back to him for more, over and over. I don\u2019t know how the people at Lucasfilm watched that and thought: yeah, this works! Especially when you compare it to Marvel\u2019s work with a young Hank Pym or Tony Stark, it just can\u2019t hold a candle. Really poor work by ILM.\n* The rivalry between Krennic and Tarkin is incoherent and unsupported by the text. It only makes sense if you\u2019ve read Catalyst.\n* Krennic\u2019s accent was all over the place. Half the time it sounded like he was wearing a retainer or fake teeth or something, making him lisp like a 4th grader. Maybe this was a product of the reshoots.\n* Chirrut was pretty ridiculous. He\u2019s not a Jedi, and he\u2019s blind, but he\u2019s such a bad mo-fo that he dodges blaster fire better than we\u2019ve ever seen a Jedi do it. He can aim and shoot down TIE Fighters with small arms, even though he\u2019s blind. He takes out whole squads of Stormtroopers in armor with just a stick. Way too OP. And I\u2019m gonna go ahead and guess that all the dudebros who whined about Rey being \u201ctoo perfect\u201d will have no problems with this guy.\n* It can\u2019t be stated enough how bad the first act of this movie is. Everything till they left Jedha was just painfully awkward and jarring. Didn\u2019t feel a lick like Star Wars.\n* Hated the retcon about Galen building in the backdoor. It was an extra explanation of something in A New Hope that needed no further justification. It was really only there to provide character background for Galen, and thus (in theory) character motivation for Jyn.\n* The tone of the Galen hologram scene was all wrong. He\u2019s delivering a massive info dump, but we keep cutting to Jyn breaking down crying. Totally incongruous. He\u2019s expositioning like crazy to explain the belabored plot to us, but the movie is asking us to feel Jyn\u2019s emotional moment instead. This smacked of reshoots.\n* I like Michael Giacchino, but the score was bad. Felt like one of the lesser video game scores, or the weird faux-scoring they do in the cartoons. This also contributed to the \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like Star Wars\u201d vibe I got.\n* The origin of the \u201cRogue One\u201d name was dumb. Rogue Squadron being so-named for being a literal rogue squadron of fighters against the Empire made more sense. It was an idea as much of a literal callsign. Here it\u2019s just an improv by Rook that gets quickly forgotten about.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nThis felt like it was written by 15-year olds. Bully for those who wanted their gritty Star Wars hardcore war movie, but after this fails to match The Force Awakens\u2019s multiplier, I hope this impulse to indulge the superfans is curbed by Lucasfilm. I think you can make a good Star Wars movie that feels like Star Wars without the Jedi/Sith conflict, but not with the mopey, cynical tone they\u2019ve got running through most of this movie.

The movie wasn't black and white like the OT movies. It showed a grittier, more morally gray side of the rebellion. They are fighting a war after all. The parallels the movie drew from the Middle East and ISIS on Jedha was awesome. Showed the Empire saw some of these rebels as terrorists. Then on Scarif, I felt like I was watching Vietnam in space. Very cool thing to see. Can't forget, the last two minutes with Darth Vader. One of the most memorable moments Star Wars history. It was like a demon had entered. The way that solider pounded on the door and begged for help really emphasized that Vader was a badass mother fucker. It looked like a scene from Alien where they knew they were going to die.

As a long time Star Wars fan it was great to get a look at the grittier side of the rebellion, on the big screen. They handeled Vader perfectly, and I'm really glad they didn't try to tie the main characters to the Force Awakens characters. I love the homogeneous aesthetic across all the movies, even though a New Hope came out decades ago, they're able to freshen up the outfits and setpieces so they have the same charm but a crisper look.\n\nI have two issues though, and they're probably going to be really unpopular. First off, I think the run time was a little long, I reckon they could have cut out Forrest Whittaker's character and not have lost much, and I also really miss John Williams' scores.

I'll be slow to watch it again tbh, just because the 3rd Act is so damn sad :P \n\nCouple thoughts I had:\n\n* Vader scenes were amazing, in particular that last scene on the Rebel ship.....holy crap.\n\n* Tarkin looked absolutely amazing, and I think they made his character even better.\n\n* I enjoyed the throwbacks(or throwforwards, I guess?) to things like the blue milk and Ponda Baba. I thought they were fun.\n\n* It felt weird to see so much characters progression, since we're used to seeing it over a trilogy\n\n* Death Troopers kinda disappointed me, they seemed like normal fighters in fancy armour more than elite soldiers.\n\n* Bodhi's death was good, I liked that it was just out of nowhere by a random trooper. Chirrut and Malbus' death were super emotional.\n\n* Really enjoyed the intense irony of Krennic dying to his own weapon.\n\n* The battles felt really tense, moreso than I remember in a long time. In VII, we knew Rey and Finn weren't going to die, it wasn't tense. In this movie, everybody was fair game and they used it to their advantage.\n\n* The Empire seemed like a powerful force, not the constantly losing incompetent military we see them as in the OT. When the Death Star came into view on Scarif, I didn't wonder how the Rebels would defeat it, I accepted that the Empire was too powerful and that our heroes would die\n\n* Jyn and Cassian's deaths were done really well, I think all of the R1 crew's deaths were done fantastically.\n\n* Too many of the actors had great performances to name of them all, Yen and Mendelsohn are the ones that stood out for me.\n\n* K2SO was really funny.\n\n* I enjoyed all of the original score, but to be completely honest I really didn't like any of the redone OT songs.\n\n* Not only did Galen Erso's input explain the problem with the original Death Star, but it also gives a reason for the second Death Star. The Empire obviously felt that they would succeed with a second when they knew all of their engineers would be on their side and it wouldn't be sabotaged. Makes it a little less ridiculous that they built a second one knowing that their first one was sabotaged.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the movie, and while it's not the greatest film in Star Wars history, it is a more than acceptable addition to the franchise.\n\n\n", "A legit teared up when Vader was murdering the rebels..."], "num_comments": 20953, "year": "2020"}, {"title": "Spectral", "comments": ["It's definitely a B movie, but it's a Netflix quality B movie. \n\nPoor dialogue, predictable structure, and nothing really original, but excellent production values and some genuinely competent direction.\n\nIt's to mid tier B movies what House of Cards is to Designated Survivor. \n\n6/10 if it was given a full release, 9/10 for something on the couch.", "[deleted]", "If I had paid to see it in a movie theater, I would have been disappointed.

That isn't what it's supposed to be used for!\" Come on bro.\n\n* Same dude turns his camera into a searchlight by 'reversing the polarity.' Then he explains over the radio to the military guys how to do it, at one point specifically mentioning they need an emitter that works on very short wavelengths. Then these lights get shone around everywhere. You think we might have an issue with shooting a beam of concentrated micro/gamma/X/whatever reflects from the condensates-rays? I know I'd rather not get that in my eyes. This is a bit specific I know, but I do a lot of work with lasers and optics, so it stood out.\n\n* Regime scientist tried to shut the constructs down, and the emergency procedure is 'use a hand tool to release sixteen pipes on a machine which provides no easy access to said pipes, and then pull a giant bracket that again has no easy access and will break the entire machine sending you plummeting to the floor.' K. You think an emergency stop button might have been a better idea? \n\n* The ADR'ed voice over several parts was incredibly obvious and looked absolutely terrible.\n\nBut as I said, as part of my monthly fee, it was fine.

Then the last 30mins is pure sci-fi action with good effects. Both are great, but like I mentioned earlier, mesh together not so well. It's very formulaic but in my opinion in a very pleasant way - everything just works and clicks together.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this, and probably would have even in cinema.

I can't wait to see him in other films in the future. ", "I did not see Casey Affleck on screen. I saw Lee Chandler, a hollow and irascible recluse who is forever tortured by his past. Some of the greatest acting I have ever seen. So subtle and subdued, he didn't have to lose weight or gain weight or play a disabled/gay character to get noticed. Nothing about his performance seems Oscar bait-ish. ", "Besides the police station, the scene that choked me up crazy was when Randi was asking Lee if they could have lunch sometime. \"I should burn in hell for the things I said to you.\" They didn't need to put in a flashback scene to let the audience know the type of stuff she was saying. I immediately thought of when Tate Donovan's character sees Lee and one of the players says, \"You know that story is bullshit.\" Fantastic movie. Think I still like Moonlight more, but I can't wait to see this one again.", "I saw it today and found it incredible. A few thoughts:\n\n* As a few have mentioned, the scene in the police station was heart-wrenching. Not just the attempted suicide, but Lee's testimony delivered as a confession and him ready to be punished for the death of his children. He wanted to be found as guilty as he felt and felt that it was wrong not to be punished for it.\n* The contrast in the lives of Lee and Patrick. Patrick comes off as so youthful and exuberant even in the shadow of his father's death, and Lee is simply a dead man walking. Neither person understands where the other is coming from, yet the familial bond exists (especially where one doesn't between Patrick and Joe's friend George).\n* Lee's resistance to Manchester is so strong and so insistent that you wonder why (especially for Patrick's sake) until he is alone with Randi. You see hints early on when he can't process that Randi is pregnant by another man, that life is restored but not through him. When Randi tells Lee \"I love you\", it cuts him so deep, like he didn't want to have heard that, that he didn't want to be forgiven in any sense for what happened.\n* Patrick treats Lee like a surrogate father almost right away, asking permission for this and that, and Lee pushes back by declaring that he does not care what Patrick thinks or does. But Lee does care when he tries to assert that no, Patrick can't have one of his two girlfriends over, finding his nephew's two-faced gaming to be too much.\n* The scene with Patrick and his mother and her new husband was so painful in the sense that we know almost right away it will not work out. The awkward moments that become even more awkward in being highlighted. The sense that Patrick could do whatever he wants but dwells in an atmosphere of control that the mother apparently needs to avoid sliding back. We further find this out in the new husband's email to Patrick where he asserts that he needs to control what the mother wants to do, apparently knowing what is best for her.\n* When Lee says he can't beat it, he means he can't ever get past his trauma and embrace the opportunity to be a parent again (especially when his drinking leads to a fire scare that could have endangered Patrick). He does feel responsibility to his brother but has to find a balance between taking care of his nephew and avoiding his demons.\n\nAs others have mentioned, despite the trauma carried through the movie, there are moments of humor -- the hand-cutting exchange being the most highlighted, plus the awkwardness of loading Randi into the ambulance, Lee asking Patrick if he's going to Godspell, etc. The ending didn't feel out of place for me since there is no nice bow to put on the whole story. Lee delivered the best solution he could conceive, and he didn't ask Patrick his preference, taking charge of the situation.\n\nI feel the above still isn't enough to capture the layers of the movie, that words do not suffice to write about the gaps between people and the stumbling that occurs throughout. It competes well with *Moonlight*, and I can't really decide on the better film, both being so different. (I've yet to see *La La Land* to compare with these two.)", "Anyone else catch what the second girlfriend's mom said to Lee when she was trying to convince him to stay for dinner? \"If you change your mind in the next 10 minutes, we'll all be here\" - just like how Lee remembered the fire 10 minutes into his walk to the store, but didn't go back, even though his kids were there (\"we'll all be here\"). Not sure if I'm over analyzing but either way it was a phenomenal film. Great writing with real characters and real situations. ", "That scene where Michelle Williams proclaims that she still loves Lee even even though she has a baby with another guy fucked me up. Both her and Casey deserve a statue. ", "Its weird how this was one of the funniest films I've seen all year.\n\nGreat comedic moments.\n\nThe film did a great job of feeling so real. Its moments in someone's life, and we are invited to discover it.\n\nThere's no big climax, no big happy or dark ending. Its just....normal.", "For me, this movie is partially about what depression feels like. Lee is the personification of it. You don't like yourself. You sit around with your emotions bottled up, not really doing much, mumbling and avoiding eye contact, because apathy is better than what you would do if you let your emotions take over. You find yourself doing things that you know will ultimately set you back (represented by Lee purposely starting bar fights) just so you don't have to move forward. For whatever reason, you feel like you just *can't* progress. Almost like you know you shouldn't be able to. Like you don't deserve it. The way that most of the scenes are shot from a distance, with flat framing and angles and no camera movement - that's what it all feels like. Even when an opportunity presents itself for you to leave your shitty job and live in a nice house in a nice town, all expenses already paid, you're still resistant to leave your shitty one-room apartment. Is there any sense in that? No. But depression doesn't make sense. \n\nAnd then the ending symbolizes that there are times where it seems like you're so *close* to making something of yourself, to pulling it together, but... nope, nevermind. Turns out you just had a good week. When they paid for the boat, it seemed all good from there. At first I expected to movie to end on Lee going to the store, allowing Patrick to finally get laid. That's a cool fatherly thing to do, it puts a satisfying end to a running subplot for the secondary character, and Lee going back to the store (I think it was the same store he went to the night his house burned down but I could be wrong) could symbolize him finally getting over what happened that night, forgiving himself, and moving on. But then the movie keeps going. He puts Patrick in more capable hands and decides to move back to Boston. To paraphrase Lee, he just... can't. He can't do it. That's what trying to make progress with depression is like. And it fucking hurts. This movie was too real. ", "That last line was perfect. \"Let it go.\" Such a simple idea when it's about a ball rolling down a hill, but so hard when it's about real life", "Severely underrated scene was the EMTs struggling to get Randi into the ambulance after the fire and Lee hesitating to help. Lee really didn't know what to do in that situation. Should he help or let the professionals continue to mess up? Lee, in his numb, emotionless state, probably felt like he shouldn't screw things up even more than he already had.\n\nIt was the most believable scene in a very realistic movie. Life doesn't slow down or get any easier when you're at your lowest point, it's just as awkward and infuriating as ever. ", "one of the more interesting parts of the film for me was the opposition between Patrick's inability to tolerate the \"frozen\" state of his father while preparing for burial, and Lee's negligence to suggest cremation as an alternative (likely due to the way his own children perished)...", "Casey Affleck needs to be in more movies", "Was it just me or was this also one of the funniest movies? I swear I laughed out loud about 10 times easily, the dialogue between Casey and the kid was just priceless at times. Absolutely hilarious and heart wrenching. ", "At the final burial when Randy's baby won't stop crying while being held. Lee's look...brings back the beginning scene where he picked up and held his kid, \"See, he didn't cry.\" Got me.", "Anyone else think the musical score was too overwrought when the big twist was revealed?\n\nOtherwise, awesome film.", "Saw this a week ago. It's my second favorite film of the year after La La Land so far. Casey Affleck delivers one of the most believable portraits of a man haunted by his past I've ever seen. It's a nuanced, funny, and thoroughly real performance, making for a career-defining display from one of this generation's best actors. If you've seen the film, you'll know what scene I'm talking about when I say I was in awe at how quietly he displayed his grief as the emotions bottle up inside of him. And the moment that grief erupts is one of the few times I've gasped out loud during a film.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this movie is how, despite the heavy drama and tragedy, it's *very* funny at times. This is due to Ken Lonergan's understanding that life is neither a strict drama or comedy, therefore his screenplay isn't binary in this aspect. Some of my favorite scenes are the banal moments that just develop these characters so realistically through their interactions.\n\n\"What happened to your hand?\"\n\"I cut it.\"\n\"Oh, for a second there I didn't know what happened to your hand.\"\n\nAll of the actors give brilliant, understated performances and I never felt I was watching performers, especially Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges. Brilliant writing, brilliant direction, brilliant acting. This movie floored me. \n\nEdit: Realized this is a discussion thread so spoilers allowed. That scene where he tries to shoot himself. Jesus", "More like **Melancholy by the Sea**", "Just saw the film. Absolutely fantastic. It's a very simple story but Lonnergan fills every character with so much depth and pathos. I love how he included those awkward moments during tragedy, like Lee misunderstanding Jacob leaving the car or the stretcher wheels never locking in place. It's a minor thing but it made the film feel so much more realistic. The scene where Lee explains how the fire started should win Casey an Oscar. What a remarkable piece of subtle acting. Really enjoyed Lucas Hass and I loved how there was no real villains, just good people trying to get by in a bad situation. Absolutely excellent film that deserves all the acclaim. ", "I thought the scene involving Patrick's panic attack was interesting.  First of all it is the only time Patrick shows an emotional reaction to his father's death, which makes sense because his family knew for years that he could die at any moment.  It goes to show that no matter how prepared you are to lose someone, it is still going to affect you in a difficult way.\n\nAlso, in the same scene in the kitchen, it is interesting to see how lee is able to help his nephew calm down but he is unable to help him on any real emotional level because he himself is so numb he simply can't empathize.  But he truly wants to, he even goes so far to break open the bedroom door so the kid wasn't in there suffering alone.  Once he is in there he again can't comfort him but he does help the situation by being there.  Shows that lee really is a good guy.  Most interesting is the fact that lee in Boston is basically a guilt-wridden depressed human being who lives in that miserable little apartment where he must beat himself up constantly night after night.  He is walled up emotionally, walled up socially, walled up in real life.  But the second his nephew tries to do the same to himself, Lee breaks that door (barrier) down, and helps him. Just something no one has figured out how to do with lee, including himself.", "I really hate it when movies leave things unresolved... is Patrick going to Godspell?", "As someone who's been dealing with depression due to loss for a while, the scene where he goes \"I can't beat it\" in a way that he felt like he'd come to terms with it, that pretty much destroyed me.", "[deleted]", "One thing I really liked about the film that I haven't seen anyone mention was the moment right after Lee makes all of his friends leave before the fire. I assumed that this type of behavior is what lead to the Lee and Randi breaking up. Specifically him standing on the balcony yelling. I assumed his drinking and partying drove the two apart. Once he goes back inside you see him and Randi talking and laughing for a brief moment. That quick subversion of where I thought the story was going made the fire that much more impactful because it makes you realize these two people weren't drifting apart. They loved each other and this horrible accident destroyed their relationship.", "This is one hell of a fucking movie. I probably cried 5 times, but none of it felt cheap or manipulative. It was just a sad, real, human situation. Casey's character had a lot of bad luck and wasn't the best dude but pretty much everyone in his life still cared about him in some way. None of the characters here are one-dimensional or antagonistic, even his ex-wife is kind of sweet and caring.\n\nThere will be a lot of talk about the scene in the police station, or the house burning, or the main scene near the end with his Williams, but the scene that got me the most was Casey and Hedges at the dinner table where Casey just says \"I just can't beat it\". That one scene is as accurate and honest a portrayal of grief, depression, and loneliness as I've seen put to film.\n\nAlso, did everyone else catch Lonergan's little cameo? Took me out of it a bit, was surprised to see him.\n\n", "Only disappointing part of the film was using clips from the same bruins game for two different scenes. Obviously it didn't matter at all, but I thought it was a bit interesting. Fantastic movie though. Loved seeing Kara Hayward and Lucas Hedges from moonrise kingdom too!", "[deleted]", "The scene where Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams meet on the sidewalk is one of the best scenes in film I've ever seen--just seeing how broken these two people are after going through a terrible tragedy, how they can't even function anymore, can't even talk or make eye contact. And just the way all this pent-up grief just gushes out in public, how they're talking over each other, how they're not sure to try and make up or just never see each other again.  Incredible.", "Two scenes I found to be particularly affective:\n- The scene after the interview is concluded at the police station when Lee realizes that no one else is going to punish him for what he's done, so he grabs the officer's gone and attempts to off himself. Fuck man, that was just so heavy. \n- The scene where Patrick has the panic attack as he frantically attempts to shove the fallen meat back into the freezer. As someone who frequently experiences anxiety, his acting in that particular scene really hit home and actually made me a bit anxious just watching him freak out. Incredible.", "This movie made me feel like I wanted to cry in every scene. The drama felt so real and emotional. Movie of the year for sure.", "The way he says 'please' in the police station, when they're stopping him from trying to kill himself haunts me", "I don't understand how people can see this more than once. I'm just so sad. I just want to hug Lee and hang out with him but he would jut shut himself off from every offer I would give. aaaaaaah, my heart hurts ", "My favorite movie of the year. The performances are just incredible. Casey Affleck is a broken man and you really feel it. Michelle Williams, while only in the movie briefly, is still fantastic. But Lucas Hedges was the real revelation for me; such a powerful performance and very convincing as a 16 year old going through tragedy like this.\n\nThe film is incredibly tragic. The scene where Lee tries to kill himself at the police station, the scene where he and Randi have their talk, and the scene where he tells Patrick that he's going to stay in Boston were all just so emotional and gut wrenching. \n\nBut at the same time it is also very funny at times.\n\nGosh, I really loved it.", "I read this in a review and I think it is spot on....Lee Chandler is a ghost who hasn't died yet. Perfect...\n", "The scene between Michelle Williams and Affleck alone should win Affleck the Oscar. Much credit to Williams who even in her limited time elevated that scene. When she admitted she loved him and started calling him honey it was heartbreaking. His response of \"there is nothing there\" and trying his best to avoid her naked emotion was an amazing scene. It was so visceral.                                             Affleck's line to his nephew of \"I can't beat it\" resonated so much. Sometimes people don't come back from tragedy. That's as real and relateable as a message as you can get.", "I have seen this movie now seven times. I have come to the conclusion that it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. \n\nKenneth Lonergan is the most gifted writer alive next to Annie Baker. A few points:\n\n1. Those who find the movie melodramatic, I respect your opinion, but I also feel you might not be paying attention. The melodramatic sequence in this movie (the fire and S.A.) specifically exists as a flashback. The movie is not about the melodramatic event of someone's life, and we very specifically do not see the central marriage disintegrate. It's about what happens after the opera curtain comes down. Stories have a natural progression of ending in tragedy or using tragedy as their central focal point, but this is about dealing with the pain of the old memory after you've already made a new one. I think the movie as a whole would be almost as powerful as it is now if they removed the flashback sequence (though it does jerk the tears), and I wish that Lonergan didn't include it, not because he doesn't handle it effectively, but because I think it causes a lot of people to misinterpret the film (not saying that I'm somehow more perceptive, but I have a lot of experience with Kenneth Lonergan, having seen and read a ton of his work, and this is a fairly common thread in some of his plays.)\n\n2. The way that Lonergan approaches clich\u00e9 situations and manages to subvert them, not with any kind of spectacular plotting but with merely his ear for the way people talk, is kind of amazing. He reveals the truth in clich\u00e9s. A lot of his plays cover this same topic as well (and are of equal quality to this movie)\n\n3. Lucas Hedges is amazing in this movie, and basically gives the masculine counterpoint to Anna Paquin's performance in Margaret. If anyone actually cares, I could go into more detail here.\n\n4. If you like this move, check out Margaret (extended cut), which is from the same writer/director and is possibly my favorite movie of all time.", "The biggest praise I can give this film is that it didn't feel like I was watching a movie. It felt like I was a fly on the wall watching these people go through tough situations. It felt so much like real life. Also love how naturally funny the film was. Not too funny, not too dramatic, just perfect. ", "I watched this tonight and have been stewing on it since. I'm going to give it some more time, but I honestly think this is one of the best movies of the decade at this point. Like on par with The Social Network and Inside Llewyn Davis for me. It hits all the notes by creating notes you didn't realize existed before you watched it.", "The scene where he intently watches the pizza reheat in the microwave because he's careful about burning things hit me right in the feels. ", "Saw this with my dad. I have never seen him cry in my life but during the conversation at the end between Lee and Randi I looked over at him and saw him sobbing. Honestly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! ", "I love the exchange between Randi and Lee towards the end. But another scene hit me real hard. When Patrick entered Lee's room and saw those three picture frames, he stops, and fully realizes just how deep is the wound for his uncle. Another standout scene is right after reading the fiance's email, Patrick is alone in the living room, watching TV. His face shows the vulnerability of a child; the face of someone no one would want. \n\nLucas Hedges' acting throughout the film is outstanding. He deserves an Oscar for his performance. \n\nLastly, this is a movie that will fuck you up. What a movie. ", "Manchester By The Sea was easily the best film I've seen all year and I can't really explain way. So much emotion packaged into a incredible film. I honestly think the November might be a stronger Oscar session/good movie month than December. We got Arrival (my number 2), Loving (strong 8/10), The Edge of Seventeen (one of the best coming of age films I've seen in a long time) and a few more I still need to see (Hacksaw Ridge, Nocturnal Animals, Miss Sloane, Lion, Elle) along with some October limiteds that expanded in November (Certain Woman, and Moonlight).\n\nAs for Manchester By The Sea it's self, It's a beautiful shot and written film. It almost feels as if the direction is a fly on the wall style. It feels like your peering into these peoples lives and it works. Extremely well.\n\nCasey Affleck gives one of the most subdued performances I've ever seen. I know this is cliche, but this movie feels real. Very real.\n\nOne of the best parts is watching Lucas Hedges. We're here watching a teenager, that I for one, completely understood. He was very much a good kid that kept fucking things up. He has a band, and he knows they suck. He has two girlfriends, and two sets of friends to go along with them. He tries, but mostly succeeds at little to nothing in this film. \n\n\n10/10\n\n\n\n\n", "Fucking loved the movie. Art is supposed to make you feel something and that's exactly what this movie did for me. Moved me in so many ways. Had surprisingly hilarious scenes too, especially with some of the interactions between Lee and Patrick. The ending surprised me, but I realized that this isn't supposed to have a happy ending, it's a view into a segment of this guy's life. It tells the tale of Joe's arrangements, and funeral, and ends there. Someone behind me said \"there's two hours of my life I won't get back\" and \"make up your own ending\". Some people just can't appreciate a damn good movie I suppose. Mind you the lady that said it was easily in her late 80's so I understand why she is so upset about \"losing\" two hours of her dwindling life. Would highly recommend this movie.", "Casey Affleck is one of my favourite actors, so I sat down to watch this movie without too much knowledge of the plot apart from his brother dying and having to look after his nephew.\nI'm a firefighter with two young kids, so from the police station scene onwards I was a blubbering mess every 5 minutes. Affleck's performance just killed me, I bought it and felt it throughout the whole movie. The scene where he packs/unpacks [the photo frames](#spoiler) destroyed me.\nI re watched the movie with my wife the next day, the early scene with Lee coming home to his family ominously shows [the fireplace](#spoiler). I had to leave the room...\n\nIf Gosling beats Casey for the Oscar, we riot.\n\nedit: Just have to add how refreshing the realism of the movie was. A lot of people would say the ending wasn't a happy one but I believe they are wrong. Sure, as far as Hollywood goes there was no warm and fuzzy gratifying ending for Lee Chandler but in the context of the pain and suffering that he will carry for the rest of his life, the small hint of Lee wanting to be apart of Patrick's life is the happiest ending I could expect. I must admit I was scared when they introduced the girlfriend's mother, part of me thought it was going to tread the trope of broken protagonist finding how to love again.", "A lot of great analysis on here! Something that I was hoping for when I watched was when Lee met his ex-wife on the street. I was hoping that Casey Affleck would go into a heartwrenching, Oscar-worthy monologue where he reveals all the wounds and regret he's been holding back the whole movie. Same thing at the end when he's telling Patrick why he couldn't stay in Manchester-by-the-sea.\n\nBut then when I thought back, I thought that this would be uncharacteristic of the hollow, emotionless Lee. I actually really like the parsimony of \"There's nothing there!\" and \"I can't beat it!\". It says so much with so few words! What do you all think?", "I think this is not so much a film about grief, as it is about men.\n\nMy wife gave me this clue as we were leaving the theatre (she pretty much wept quietly all the way through): \"It's terrible to see men trapped in this cage of class and gender. Even the women have to be tough.\"\n\nThe men, centred of on Lee, are not allowed to show grief. They're not allowed to show love. When Lee shows concern for his nephew Patrick, he does so by kicking the door down. When Lee decides to take on the guardianship of Patrick, he doesn't do it by telling Patrick he cares, but by telling him that he's going to sell the boat that Patrick loves, though he's doing this out of concern for Patrick's security and future. Patrick doesn't want to leave Manchester, so Lee goes looking for a job\u2014but never tells him.  When Lee drinks, and the grief comes up, he expresses the grief through violence: by punching other men. When the grief is freshest and at its worst, he tries to shoot himself: an act of violence. When Lee meets Randi on the sidewalk, and Randi starts freely expressing how she feels, he responds by fleeing. The other men too. When Patrick is reminded of his father by the frozen chickens falling from the freezer, he doesn't cry: he clutches his chest and has a panic attack. When George expresses care for Lee, he does so by buying furniture, or saying \"anything I can do\" to help with funeral arrangements. \n\nMany people complain about the lack of emotion shown in the film, and the apparent lack of character development. But the film is as much about the cage as it is about grief. Into this group of caged men the writer throws this cluster bomb: the death of the three children by fire. The rest is the reaction of the characters.\n\nBut in this cage, both emotion and and development cannot be freely expressed. We have to read it through the tiniest of signs, some of them (like the ones described above) disguised as violence or cruelty.\n\nThere are signs of optimism towards the end. On the boat, Lee smiles once\u2014perhaps the only time he smiles post-fire. There's also the ball play on the street. \n\nThe tension in the film comes from the fact that straight raw emotion is almost never shown\u2014except for in Randi's scene on the street, which is powerful precisely because of the background of emotional suppression in the rest of the film. Because it never shown, we have to pay constant close attention to try and figure out what the hell is going on inside the characters, hidden behind these iron shutters, clues only peeking out in tiny gestures, or in distorted forms as explosions of anger.\n\nThe film doctor Robert McKee once said that you should never tell your audience the whole story, because they have to left to work out what's not shown. This film does that in spades. \n\n", "I think my favorite part of the movie is the sound design. Let me explain. The entire movie is a masterful demonstration on subtlety, in its acting, writing and directing. But what really sold the sheer banality of it all was the sound effects. Non-stop, in every scene, during the tensest of moments. They never let up. ", "Of all things, I really liked how natural the dialogue felt, specifically in the scene where Lee finds out Joe died an hour before he got to the hospital. It just felt so down to earth and real. I thought it did really great job at setting the tone for the rest of the film", "At the end of the film, when Lee is fixing up some guys house, I noticed something. The company on the truck he works for is actually based in Manchester (I live here), so that can show that he found a job that wasn't in Boston.", "I saw this film last night in Boston. I moved to Boston from the west coast 5 years ago, and this film really captures a certain New England thing; where acceptance, not idealism, rule. Lee Chandler is a terribly damaged version of that, but it ring so true of others in the film.  There's the great recurring theme of frozen ground. The boy complains about it and is quite upset. Lee doesn't do much to help the kid understand or work through it. He just repeats 'ground is frozen'. Accept it, don't complain. Don't expect anyone to sugar it up for you. I liked the movie last night and am beginning to love it. It won't leave you for a while. As others note it's not fast-paced, but it is dense with suggestions of emotions, little clues to understanding. It feels like watching a leaf fall very slowly down from a tree in early winter. Makes you feel that way.

Towards the end of the movie, he mentions that he's looking for an apartment with more than one room. I interpreted this as Lee finally starting to heal and let himself move on in life.", "Thinking back, there are a few lines that stand out to me as being especially important/heartbreaking. One was when Affleck was speaking to his ex-wife about Hedges's character being okay because \"he doesn't really open up to me, but he has a lot of friends, so I think he's okay.\" Which was true, Hedges really leaned on his friends to maintain a sense of normalcy during his bereavement, and they were constant throughout the film. \n\nThen consider the scene where Affleck steps into the office if his former employer (I think?) to ask for shifts, and the guy's wife comes around the corner and tells him she doesn't want to see Affleck again. Affleck's character had no support from anyone but his brother. The rest of the town really seemed to turn on him. They left him to mourn alone.\n\nIt all sort of culminates for me when they're playing ball at the end of the film. Affleck tells him to let it go, and Hedges refuses. Two very different responses to tragedy, with two very different sets of support structures surrounding them.

Besides, if you're here and haven't seen the film yet you're probably aware that you've put yourself at risk for seeing spoilers. Nevertheless, SPOILERS ahead....:\n\n\nI wonder if Lonergan ever thought of including flashback scenes of media coverage of the tragic house fire. This type of terrible situation is someone like Nancy Grace's wet dream (my thoughts on how Nancy covered tragic stories on her show is a different story). I feel like in the days/weeks/months following there would be extensive coverage of the events. It can be assumed that Lee was ultimately exonerated of any wrong doing in the death of his three children, correct? If that was truly the case, even if it didn't occur in a social media era, it definitely did occur in an era where stories like these would dominate TV/radio news programs, daytime talk shows, newspapers, etc etc. A young father of three children holds party at his house with his buddies until 2-3am in the morning, where cannabis, cocaine, and lots of alcohol was consumed. When the party is ended by his wife, the father sets the fireplace to warm the house and then decides to go to a nearby corner store. Intoxicated and not wanting to drive, the father decides to walk even though it's an altogether 40 minute trip by foot. 10 minutes into his trek, he can't remember if he put the fireplace screen up but figures it will be okay and decides to continue walking to the store. When he returns, he is greeted by the scene of his young wife resisting fire fighters and screaming that her kids are still in the house, which is now completely ablaze. His wife survives, but his three kids (one of them only a couple years old if that) do not. \n\nThe father admits to authorities that he wasn't sure whether he put the screen up or not before leaving to go to the store. He also openly admits of the substance abuse that went on earlier that night.\n\nIt's obvious that Lee was blamed by a lot of people in the community for the fire, including his (eventual ex) wife. But I would wager the story reached beyond just his community. If he was in fact fully exonerated of any responsibility in the death of his three children, I would wager that the story went national for at least awhile. We can all imagine the amount of guilt Lee feels about his kids fate even without the public and media scrutiny. But I can't imagine the amount of stress, anxiety, and overall darkness the man went through if he had to deal with this tragedy in the public eye.\n\nI don't know, this thought just made Lee's story even more powerful and sad.

Such an incredible depiction of grief and loss and how unique it is between people. Absolutely love the subtle conclusion as well [with the ball scene where Lee says leave it but Patrick picks it up and eventually gets him to continue tossing it. Such a great metaphor for Patrick helping Lee eventually make something of what he has left. I can see how people would have preferred a tidier ending but I feel like given the absolute shell the character was depicted as an entire turn around would just be too unrealistic. Too me what was best about the movie was its authenticity and a storybook ending would betray that. This ending hints at an uplifting ending without tying things up too nicely and also demonstrates what other movies tend to leave behind, that loss isn't something you ever totally move on from, you just adapt and eventually become better suited to live with it.](#spoiler)", "[deleted]", "I thought Broderick absolutely nailed his small part.

His return there does not grant him, or us the audience , any happy turnaround where the movie shows us that \"even though you've been through something terrible, you can still get back\", as you might expect. The movie hints about it with the single mom and a couple of endearing  scenes between lee and his nephew. Towards the end we get a 2 minute or so long scene with some happy music where it seems thing's are gonna be A - okay, \"i'm beginning to see the light\" ,maybe Lee can make this work with his nephew in manchester? But then he runs into his past, and is reminded that it will never be possible for him to ever live in this town again. Even with the forgiveness of his wife, he could never forgive himself.  \n\nIn the end  our hero is too far gone to ever live a happy and fulfilling life.  He is a tragic reminder  that if you go through a terrible enough tragedy the grief never ends it just... exist,as much a part of you as your eyes, your hands and your soul. \n\nThe happy ending we is get is an extra room for the nephew  and a  tiny glimmer of hope that their relationship will give Lee a reason to go on.

Very melancholy.", "if you watch it for the second time you'll find lee arriving one hour late after his brother died extremely hurtful,it's like the only remaining person in the world who loves and cares about Lee is gone ", "Commenting here as IMDB message board closed down. The movie was very boring, slow and very uplifting. \n\nAs a resident, Greater Boston, Quincy and North Shore I find to be a very cold place. Personally, on a drive or walk to Gloucester/Cape Ann area (where Manchester by the Sea is) to the art galleries or deep sea fishing, I'd probably never taken a second look at someone like Lee and write him off as just a Masshole Townie; (for anyone outside of Mass who is shocked at my prejudice/elitism, simply refer to the beginning scene between the black female tenant and Lee in Quincy, even when there is empathy/understanding, there is a great chasm in town vs. gown relations and racial & class relations underneath the superficial liberal political leanings of New England). \n\nThe movie didn't change my mind on Masshole townies nor increase my empathy for people like Lee. But it did change how I see love - or rather make allowance that I'd never be able to love someone, friend, relations or a partner in the Hollywood/Kodak framed moment kind of way; but will make do with imperfect gestures that will ultimately fall short, perhaps never be completely appreciated nor understood by my intended recipient and whatever heartfelt/self-serving content said completely forgotten later on; but the feelings felt in that moment between the participants will live on. \n\nIt turns out that the people who have blocked their true selves and communications were Matthew Broderick and Lee's nephew's mother who concerned themselves with living the \"pious\" and \"reformed religious\" life that they had nothing to say except the rigid Hollywood/Kodak image they wished to preserve of themselves by withholding their vulnerabilities. \n\nI actually thought Michelle William's emotional scene was not as powerful as the restrained love expressed by Lee and his family; fishing, buying furniture, just driving the nephew in the car. Even Dr.Bethany's words explaining \"cardiomyal weakness,\" her empathy - down to the awkward elevator scene of the new male attending doctor who didn't have the same history with Lee's family but his attempt to show basic human decency to Lee by not even speaking. \n\nWe plot out so many things to be perfect. Like our ideal vision of high school prom, college graduation, weddings when most of us plod along like being in an amateur awkward high school band concerned with critiquing our accompanying rushing or dragging drummer when we can't even manage the timing of strumming simple chords ourselves on the guitar either. Instead we have to rely on the graciousness of others to tolerate our first clumsy attempt, and help by pulling down their pants for us and get carried on with it. \n\nCarrying on with it is my interpretation. In a restrained relationship, we don't necessarily have to have reached an epiphany to call or rekindle the friendship. It will still be awkward, things will feel brief and negative feelings, unresolved stuff will bubble up; and any detente, reproachment may still fall short or could end abruptly. But moments are what we have and are too brief/precious for us to hide ourselves in and not take the opportunity to make asses out of ourselves. ", "Did anyone else think that Lee was actually a really smart guy? Not that that's a surprise because he's working-class or anything, but a surprise as in out-of-the-ordinary smart.

Or how he's the only one who can seem to remember the damn town his aunt and uncle moved to in Minnesota.\nKinda sad when you think about how much untapped potential he might have, and how that can apply to so many people.", "This film just felt so real.

", "The movie is fantastic for many reasons - pace, acting, realism, etc. I want to touch on just one facet of why it was so good; its accurate depiction of grief and death. I've faced a number of losses in my life and I thought this movie touched well on so many of the things that happen after someone dies. All the little details regarding going to appointments and making decisions were spot on. Here are a few I noticed and wanted to mention off the top of my head. \n\n\n* Lee not knowing he was to be taking in his nephew Patrick, despite Joe putting it in the will\n\n\n* Patrick's friends not really understanding how to deal with the situation and instead making jokes and trying to cheer him up and getting caught up in the banality of normal life. As well, Patrick going along with it because he feels like he's supposed to or wants to avoid the shitty feelings himself.\n\n\n* The understated love that exists but is not as noticeable because of the circumstances and people's own insecurities and grief. People in the real world have trouble expressing their thoughts and ideas normally, nevermind when it comes to grief. I thought this captured it well.\n\n\n* The lack of eureka moment. Often grief takes time to process and sometimes may take years. It is sometimes easier to push it all away instead of trying to work through it and deal with it.\n\n\n* The sleepless nights that no one else has a window into. \n\n\n* The outbursts of violence - especially when drinking. If grief is left without being addressed, the pain and anger comes out when all internal guards are down. \n\n\nThere were many more. This was the most accurate depiction of grief and death I've ever seen in a movie and as I sat in the theatre it brought me back to my sixteen year old self who had lost his father. And it has gotten me reflecting and thinking of how I dealt with grief and continue to. These days, it's not too often a movie has that affect and for that I have to say it was fantastic.

My only gripe with the film is the casting decision of Matthew Broderick. It was completely unnecessary and all it served was to immediately take you out of the movie for a brief moment. The reaction from most people in the theatre as well as myself was \"ahahah Matthew Broderick\". I was completely immersed in the film and the characters the entire time, and this scene completely took me out of that zone.\n\nThey could have casted any non a-list or recognizable actor for this small role and it would have been equally as effective.", "I just watched this last night and it really has hit me in the feels pretty hard.  My brother and I lost both of our parents this year and losing him alone would definitely ruin me (let alone the loss of 3 children and a marriage).  I desperately wanted that feel good happy ending the entire time and even though we didn't get it I was somewhat uplifted at the end.  Patrick wanted his Uncle to stay and he had been through so much and admitted that he could not do it after everything that had happened, but just that final scene where he tells him he's looking for an extra bedroom so Patrick can visit made me happy.  He still wants to be a part of his life and we don't know what will happen, but I think he had turned a small corner where he realized he can help Patrick and still be there for him.", "Think there's nothing more to be said about this piece of art but can anyone explain the relevance of the old man at the end (who played chess with Lee's father) telling Lee who was working in his basement that story about how his own father died out fishing in a tuna boat on a clear day, no storms and no trouble expected and they never found his body. The old man then ended it with 'and that was it'. It moved to the next scene shortly afterwards.", "I put off watching this because I felt like this was something that I'd find dull. Yeah about that... I thought this movie flew by. Casey Affleck was as good as advertised, but Lucas Hedges stole this movie for me. \n\nEvery character felt so real and fleshed out but I thought the Patrick character brought a lot of humour and depth to the story and Hedges deserves a lot of attention for that. I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing what he does in the future.\n\nSide note: I was SO glad that there wasn't any unnecessary \"you're not my real dad\" drama between Lee and Patrick. \n\nEDIT: Also in the drumming scenes, the only thing I kept thinking was \"Were you rushing or were you dragging?!\"", "During the \"Lets get lunch some time scene\" when he keeps saying \"There's nothing..\" and Carey keeps cutting him off or he keep stamering, at first you think he's trying to say \"There's nothing you need to say, you don't have to say sorry\" or something to that effect.\n\nBut his none reaction to the sorry just made me think that he saying \"There's nothing to say sorry too, I'm not that person anymore. I have nothing in me anymore\" he's essentially considers himself as a husk of a person. His grief is so profound it's stripped him of himself completely.\n\nAs well at the end when he tells Patrick to \"just let it go\" about the ball. Lee gives him an inch with playing with the ball and Patrick tries to get a mile but Lee just doesn't have anything else to give. \n\nThat's how I saw it at least. This movie was incredible. ", "I watched the movie twice, and I liked it quite a bit. Although, frankly, the second viewing didn't make me love the movie that much more than I already did. \n\nAnd I think that was due to the score, and how intrusive I felt it to be, especially in the first half. There were so many scenes I just wish were silent. I thought the music kinda didn't allow me to breathe and absorb the scene as much as I wanted. Eg.: [When Lee and Joe were at Lee's burned-down home and Lee's sees one of his kids being removed in a bodybag. I feel toned down music or even silence would've helped the scene better.](#spoiler) I do remember reading that Lonergan was purposeful with this as he wanted the music the be representative of what Lee no longer felt and had in his life. While this does help provide some perspective, I still personally feel some scenes would've been aided more by something more complimentary.\n\nSmall thing I noticed: [in the bit where Patty is reading the e-mail from his mom's fianc\u00e9, there's another e-mail of Sylvia asking him to prom. Totally a small thing, but says something about the Patty-Sylvia relationship given that she asked him out through e-mail.](#spoiler)\n\nAnother thing I really, really loved in the opening and closing scenes. [The similarities are obvious: the Chandlers are fishing together on their boat. It's worthwhile to notice what is missing now in the final scene. One, the father, and two, that long white vertical pole railing thing at the back of the boat (which I presume was some sort of protective railing so kid Patty doesn't fall overboard). It's an interesting set design element that invites us to remember what was lost and what it used to mean to both Patty and Lee.](#spoiler)\n\nOne thing I didn't get: [there's this one scene where Sandy and Patty are walking into a house, and she mentions that she knows about his second girlfriend. Yet the next scene is them in bed after having sex. Why? How was she cool about her boyfriend cheating about her? Of course, this isn't a big thing, but I'm still left a little wondering haha.](#spoiler)", "I know this thread is old now and this will probably go unnoticed but one thing I didn't see mentioned here is when Randi is getting put into the ambulance and Lee is sort of hesitantly touching her trying to comfort her, I think?

It is definitely not for everyone. It is subtle, slow and bleak. Many scenes felt sort of pointless to me but at the same time I was never bored of it. The landscape shots, although being way too many, were just gorgeous to look at and maybe it has to do with me not having that sort of scenery where I'm from, but I have to say that it merits a rewatch just for that. \n\nThe movie is a masterclass in acting, if I may say so. Both Casey Affleck and the actor who played Patrick (can't remember his name) were great. I felt like the director was aware that without magnificent performances, the movie would fail miserably. \n\nThere were moments in which the camera lingered on people, which felt sort of awkward as we as an audience are not use to this gaps, but they also allowed the actors to show the full lenghts of the emotions they were portraying. \n\nIn a way,I think it is an excellent movie that needs to be digested correctly and watched with a critical mind in order to fully appreciate.

What Lonergan does can best be described as an attempt to capture the feeling of \"sonder\" through cinema.  He puts his protagonists in the background of scenes essentially starring side characters, has them drop in late and leave early, so their stories play out in a fully realized world, like a series of candid moments casually observed by a random passerby (Lonergan himself has a cameo in one such role).

Even though she was a tertiary character, Bateman and Miller being primary and Aniston and Munn being secondary, the way she performed made her a secondary character and by the end of the movie was pretty much a secondary character. Most of the other characters had their own stories going on that didn't mix with the main storyline other than that they wanted to keep their job. Although Aniston's character looks to be the only antagonist, there is another antagonist in the movie that pops up later on which I won't spoil. If you were going into this movie hoping for some secret cameos then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed as almost all if not all the characters have already been introduced in the trailers.\n\nOverall this was a funny movie that I'll definitely watch again but for some of you might warrant more of a RedBox or streaming viewing instead. The movie definitely pushes a hard R rating and definitely couldn't have been a PG-13 without some major changes to the comedy although the storyline wouldn't need any changes as it's a basic cookie cutter plot with a couple of twists.

Virginia is obviously an important Supreme Court case for me, and I really love how the film humanized this story and didn't sensationalize the real world drama.

My fiance has told me stories that would make the hair on your skin stick up about the racism her own parents faced being an interracial couple, and the disregard for own existence by her family that occurred while she was still a fetus, and she was born in 1993.

In fact, as the film went on, I no longer saw Nick Kroll playing Bernie Cohen, I saw Bernie Cohen himself. Great acting.", "[deleted]", "I loved this movie. Nichols is one of my favorite directors working today and this might be up there behind Take Shelter for me. I know some people may say it's slow and doesn't stand out, but I think it's rare that a biopic (for lack of a better term) concentrates so hard one just two characters. We never saw news reels or outside characters, it was only ever the Lovings. Great score, cinematography and performances. Great to see Nichols handle something that's not totally original and knock it out of the park. ", "Looks like I found another good film to give a watch before bed. Will report back on how I felt. \\o\n\n**EDIT**: This movie was simply beautiful and painful to watch at times. I'm from Virginia (live there currently), and even now to this day this kind of relationship is still very hard to maintain and even show on display. Their fight to validate the different form of their love was absolutely noble, Ruth and Joel did an amazing job and this is definitely a movie I would recommend to all the men and women who are ultimate sweet hearts for this genre of movie.", "This has only just come out really in the UK so went to see it yesterday.

Every time it seemed to be gearing up for something I thought it fell flat. I accept that the director wanted to show the everyday continuous struggle of an interracial couple but I felt like that was little motivation to continue watching and not just google it. Perhaps I need a repeat viewing. \n\nFor me the most tragic part was that Loving died after they had finally gained some closure. ", "Easily Nichols' 'weakest' film. But I can't help applaud the genuine sincerity in telling this important story that led to archaic laws being ruled unconstitutional. Both Edgerton and Negga were great as well. I'll be genuinely surprised if she doesn't net a Best Actress nomination.", "On the whole, I thought this was Nichols' first miss (for me, at least). I've loved every one of his previous works, and I appreciate the slow burn atmosphere he creates, but this one was a little to slow for me. Negga and Edgerton are both outstanding and they really create an incredible relationship together, but it just felt like it was missing something. The movie felt significantly longer than its runtime.  \n\nI remember seeing Nichols say that writing and directing his first true story was his hardest challenge yet. Perhaps it's not his ideal realm? I'm still extremely excited for his next feature.

Edward sees money in his future for the first time ever. And he got there by doing the opposite of what Susan told him to do - writing about himself. Meanwhile, Susan's lifestyle is falling apart because of her husband's financial troubles. So now she's stuck with a guy she doesn't love but married (in part) for his money, and that seems to be on the way out. So she's trying to go back to Edward, but he's clearly over her. It's a revenge story within a revenge story.](#spoiler)", "I just saw this movie yesterday [and have been wondering if it is possible that Edward didn't actually stand Susan up?](#spoiler)\n\nIf you can bear with me:\n\nThe relevance of Susan's perception, and sort of overall take on what happened between her and Edward, take the forefront in this film a number of times.  We see the novel play out for us colored by Susan's personal touch-- we see it in the likenesses of Tony and his wife and daughter's characters.  We see it in the obese women from Susan's art installation, in the setting of the novel outside of the bar.    \n\n[We then also see that Susan's perception of the relationship is that she had done something really 'brutal' to Edward.  She believes that she's done something very horrible to him. She feels guilty.  She subconsciously is anticipating revenge.  When we see the giant revenge painting at the gallery, it feels like some kind of looming foreshadowing for the story, but then we learn that she purchased the painting herself-- the threat of revenge is only looming in her mind.   She is scaring herself, and then not even realizing she is the one doing it.  We then immediately see her scare the shit out of herself with the jumpscare scene where she imagines Ray is in the baby's room not he phone.  She is on edge.  She is expecting something coming... we see this also when she is reading the novel.  The scenes between the novel, and her real life, often transition through a startle.  But the story itself isn't honestly like, suspenseful in a jumpscare way.](#spoiler)\n\n[The novel itself, is a tale of revenge in a way, but does it actually in the end, tell a story where we feel like anything was gained from the revenge?  Tony doesn't actually seem to Feel the thirst for revenge-- it seems like what he's looking for is closure but it looks like he is expecting it through answers, through a dialogue, he wants to know what happened, he wants the details. We see Tony devastated more than we see him angry or vengeful.  His detective friends seems to seek justice--but his character, while coming off on the surface as in control and masculine, is basically emasculated by his illness.  What we do see of Revenge in the novel, is embodied in a character that when it comes down to it is weak, absent, and vomiting when Tony is in the room with the two men who devastated his life. He's doesn't seem driven by revenge--we see that when he falters when he actually HAS the opportunity. He can't shoot them.  He can barely point the gun at them.  He doesn't violently hurt Ray in the end.  He shoots him in self defense.  And if we call that revenge, then what revenge he does end up getting, lands him blind, and ultimately dead, anyway.   Do we get the idea that Edward is enacting vengeance, from his novel really, or from Susan's life? Do we feel like Edward is even really telling us a such a clear cut revenge tale?  Or do we end up allowing our reading of his story to be colored by Susan's heavy handed expectation for revenge, with the giant revenge painting, with her jumpiness, her anxiety....](#spoiler)\n\n[And finally, in the end-- we don't actually see Susan respond to Edward's message that he is happy to meet up with her to talk.  We never see them actually arrange to meet.  We see her email to him asking to meet.  We see him saying yea just tell me when and where.  And the next thing wee see, is her getting ready to go, with emphasis on her shallowness, on the things that Edward exemplifies that opposite of.   And then we see her enter some incredibly fancy, expensive, elitist restaurant.  Not the kind of place you think that a woman who has realized the emptiness and hollowness of her shallow life choices, and wants now to jump back into more genuine, true things with Edward.](#spoiler)  \n\n[My reading is that she didn't actually respond to Edward.  That she Chose her shallow and empty lifestyle, once again. We see her fear and guilt taking over her judgement-- she is once again, not brave enough to immerse herself in what Edward symbolizes to her.  It wasn't just her relationship with him that she couldn't bring herself to choose, but she also couldn't really indulge it in herself. She couldn't jump into things creatively, always more concerned with material concerns.   And it leaves her lonely.  But she chose it in the beginning, and she chooses it again at the restaurant, even though it leaves her feeling the pangs of nostalgia (as she occasionally glances at the door--as she notes the conversation behind her of someone being shown to their seat imagining if it were Edward). She is so paralyzed, once again, by her fear of what Edward represents, and watching that play out in her anticipation to receive some kind of revenge, that she doesn't take the risk.  We as the viewers, have been watching this through the perception of Susan-- so we too, are anticipating revenge from Edward.  But in her anticipation of that, she ultimately sabotages herself.] (#spoiler) \n\n[We never see her check her phone to see if he has texted or called--even though the film integrates this kind of communication into the film between her and edward and her and her husband.  It leaves it out here.](#spoiler)\n\nAlso, considering how jumpy she has been, she isn't actually all that nervous or anxious here.  She seems somewhat uncomfortable, but ultimately more at ease, or more decided, than she has been at many other points in the film.](#spoiler)", "Fuck that jumpscare", "The whole novel storyline chilled me to the bone.

If you have ever been left, it feels brutal. The loss and pain are represented by ray Marcus's bruatality. It's almost unbelievable. Edward would be thinking, \"how can you do this to us\". The wife's death in the novel represents the death of the woman who loved him. When someone leaves you they are no longer the person who loved you. Something else takes over. They become someone else. She became Ray Marcus. One minute they loved you, and now they are acting like someone else. Edward fights to find out where his old love went. it is very painful to realize that the person who used to love you is no Loner there( when he find out she was killed by Ray). Ray is the new personality of his wife and it is not just a faze (ray gets out of jail and continues to exist).  He must confront the new person. Ray's death is Edward confronting and accepting that the woman who used to love him is gone. Edwards death is the death of the part of him that loved his wife. He got over it.

She\u2019s stranded in a loveless marriage to a hunky husband (Armie Hammer) who\u2019s more occupied with work (and other women) than anything regarding his wife. Cue the ex-husband\u2019s typescript, sent to Morrow at a time when she\u2019s in desperate want of connection. A way to contact her ex again \u2013 just what she needs, right? Not quite.\n\n\nThe novel within a film plunges headfirst into a highway scene with a ferocious intensity that rivals Sicario\u2019s border crossing scene last year. It\u2019s a jagged, welcome tonal shift, tinged with uncertainty over what\u2019s going to happen. In fact, the whole narrative of Nocturnal Animals \u2013 both the film itself and its titular typescript \u2013 is unpredictable, and we can\u2019t help but sympathise with the main character\u2019s (Jake Gyllenhaal) hapless plight in this thrilling revenge story.\n\n\nBack in the real world \u2013 shot with fusty gusto \u2013 Morrow is mulling over the story and recollecting haunted memories of her prior life with her ex-husband. There\u2019s a sense of disconnect, of lack of relevance, but suddenly parallels between their romance and the typescript\u2019s narrative become apparent, building to a devastating final scene that\u2019s as electrifying as it is inevitable. The film is endlessly evolving, bludgeoning past brutal plot points and descending into irresistible, dirty delirium, heightened by Abel Korzeniowski\u2019s sublimely tempestuous score. Yet director Tom Ford and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey give control to the chaos, with an assuredness applied to the kinetic camerawork, the brooding pans of musty citylife and desolate deserts. The danger and immorality on display really is tangible.\n\n\nOne source of danger comes in the form of Aaron Taylor Johnson\u2019s terrifying and unhinged Ray Marcus, who torments Gyllenhaal and his fictional family. This is Johnson\u2019 best performance of his career, committing to his character\u2019s sleaziness and repugnancy, and preventing Ray from becoming caricaturish. Another brilliantly absurd character is the cop looking for him, played by Michael Shannon with straight-faced hilarity. He\u2019s a character inflicted with lung cancer, who continues to smoke (\u201cWell, yep, that\u2019s how it works\u201d), and nearly steals the show with his deadpan delivery and questionable morals. Other recognisable, or renowned actors, are relegated to the sidelines, however: Michael Sheen and Jena Malone each feature in blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cameos, but at least their fleeting moments are highlights.\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen this film twice now, which I suppose is testament to how the film grips \u2013 and then sinks its claws into you. It\u2019s menacing, and bold, and each scene is displayed with enough unwavering confidence and dedication by Ford (save for one Gyllenhaal outburst) that it all holds together. That this is only his sophomoric effort, after his acclaimed \u2018A Single Man\u2019, is truly astonishing. He may not just be a fashion designer, but he uses his considerable expertise in that field to capture beautiful imagery and symbolic costume design, and boy, it works.\n\n\nFord has birthed a film that\u2019s dripping with grime but presented with gloss, creating an almost ugly beauty that\u2019s visually fascinating. It\u2019s a savage study of an intricate relationship, furnished with the bravado of a director that knows how to handle a script that\u2019s jet-black in both themes and humour, and bolstered by a blistering score and vivid camerawork.\n\n__\n\nEdit: A link to my site in case u want to see this review and other reviews by me! :) http://www.edgarreviews.co.uk/", "Aaron Taylor Johnson was a good actor in this movie, can't say I saw that coming^^^/s\n\nIn all seriousness, the realism of a lot of the scenes *(ESPECIALLY the pull-over scene from the novel)* made it so much more tense. No insane bond/slasher villain plot. Just some crazy people you'd likely hear about in the news.\n\nThis movie just proves even further how much of an amazing actor Gyllenhaal is, alongside Adams, Shannon and I suppose Taylor-Johnson, of course. \n\nIf I wasn't broke I'd see this movie again. A movie that really makes you feel for the characters, think about what it all meant and want more is a good movie in my opinion, and that's exactly how I felt afterwards. \n\nOnly things I disliked: \n\n* I feel some specific details could have used more context, although this is just a very stupid pet peeve and doesn't reflect on the film as a whole. Also the movie can be very ambiguous at times, so it didn't bother me all that much.\n\n* The intro just felt like it dragged on a fair bit, it's like someone that thinks everything is art, and won't shut up about it.

Again, this is speculation, but it makes sense to me.\nThe horrible thing that Susan did to Edward was leave him but ultimately, make him believe that she aborted his child. She in fact, did not have an abortion but never told Edward the kid was hers, which is in return just as horrible. Eventually, Edward finds this out and we know this because we see him drop off the package at her house, so he knows where she lives and has been keeping track of her all these years. \nThe detective's character represents Edward. He mentions in the cafe that he is dying of lung cancer, but that he also has a daughter who he isn't really in contact with. Could this be Edward telling Susan that he knows it's his daughter and maybe even revealing that he himself has lung cancer? I think maybe there is a little bit of Edward in both Michael Shannon's character and Tony's. He wants to seek revenge on Susan so badly because of all the horrible things she's done to him, but ultimately knows that she is already unhappy and that any real revenge would end up hurting himself. It's a story about mourning the loss of a lover and a child. He has no contact with them and wishes, like Tony, that he had tried harder to hold on to that love.\nJust my 2 cents.\n", "Gone Girl for dudes.", "So, my fianc\u00e9 and I were discussing why Jake was double cast as the lead Tony/Edward and Amy Adams is not playing the wife in the story within the story. We decided that was very deliberate in that the wife in the story is Edward's ideal version of Susan. I also believe that Ray, the ringleader of the redneck gang, is actually the symbolic representation of what Susan has become, an abusive person who believes that he is not a man. His masculinity is called into question in a previous scene with him, where she marvels at how \"sensitive\" he is when he hears that her brother had a crush on him. Instead of responding with \"horror\" as many \"straight\" men might, he simply admits that he should call his friend. Later, she is walking with him and tries to soften the blow about breaking up with him, and she says he is wonderful and romantic and sensitive. He says that she says that he is \"weak.\" He says that she has said it before. So, maybe he is projecting. Maybe Amy becomes her mother because the things Susan has loved becomes the things she hates. Either way, Ray becomes the embodiment of the emasculating Susan. So, in the story, he must exact revenge on the person who says the very worst emasculating things to him, including asking the ideal wife for a tampon for his bleeding nose, he is asked if she wears the pants in the family, he can't change a tire etc,. She may not have actually been abusing him in this way, but his perception of her is that she feels he is \"weak.\" Ray has killed both his \"daughter\" and his idealized \"wife.\" In the story, Edward gets the catharsis he needs by finally pulling the trigger, killing Ray, so that the \"weak\" Tony can finally die, (falling on his own sword) so that Edward can live. Now, he is truly the artist because of facing his fears and working it out through his art. ", "I've seen people discussing how Susan's world (the \"real\" world) seems much more fake and romanticized than Edward's book, which I agree is true. \n\nOn another note, though, I found it interesting that the film created tension and suspense in both the \"real\" world and within the story. In fact, there isn't really any suspense in the real world until Susan starts reading the manuscript, which is obviously very intense. From that point on, aided by the cutting and jumpscares, the real world is pervaded by a sense that something violent or dangerous is coming, largely because of Susan's reactions. \n\nThe movie-within-a-movie creates a sense of tension and makes the real world feel like a thriller, despite the fact that nothing violent occurs in Susan's real world and we have no reason to expect that it will. This is fantastic meta-cinema, and I loved the ways it played with our interpretations of art, and especially with our tendancy to see ourselves within artwork.

So many wonderful elements to write about but here's a few of the most satisfying for me. The highway scene at the beginning of the movie was the most unnerving, tension ratcheting marvel. The increasing dread infused into this scene will stay with me for a long time. \n  The way Tom Ford juxtaposed the the rich warm over saturated tones of the novel storyline against the muted drab grays of Susan's life were visually arresting, and a testament to his talent for telling a story through mise en scene.\n  Michael Shannon, Michael Shannon, Michael Shannon.

Mission accomplished.\n\nSo now what is Edward doing at the end when he's not at the restaurant? Killing himself? Killing Walker?

The death is Isla and India is to me the same as the abortion and also when Edward die inside from the realisation.\nSheriff Bobby turns up starting to help Tony just as Hutton shows his support in real life. \n\nThing is that it leads to no good: the killers is killed one by one just as Susan's wealthy life is falling apart pieces by pieces. It turns out that Bobby has cancer, just as it turns out that Hutton is having an affair which leads to the death of Bobby and the death of Hutton's love for Susan.\n\nTony loses his wife and daughter, his support in Bobby and what killed his family. But he accidently shoots himself hunting them down.\n\nSusan loses Edward and their daughter,  her husband and what took Edward and their daughter away (hunt for a wealthy life).

But I think I read it differently than some of you: to me, it wasn't about revenge as much as it was about author and audience.\n\nI have a few reasons for thinking this: \n\n1. We only ever see Edward through Susan's eyes. We never meet him in reality and see how he really is, only how he's remembered by Susan and how she projects that memory of him into his own work. She thinks he wants revenge for the things she did to him, and that's what his work becomes about, because she is the reader.\n\n2. [As soon as she starts reading the novel, Edward becomes the dad character, the daughter character looks enough like her daughter to warrant a phone call, and the wife character looks like her sort of, too. We infer that this is how he wrote the description of the characters, but I took it as her projecting their relationship onto characters in the book. Read like this, the events of the novel are a lot more about Susan's guilt over their split 19 years ago, rather than his festering hatred of her. She's a shallow person that made everything about her in their relationship (refusing to support his dreams, cheating on him/abortion with Armie Hammer), and now she's making his first great novel all about her, too. She assumes he's hung up on her because he never remarried, but she hasn't talked to him, she doesn't know. So much of the information we get in the film is filtered through her depressive/obsessive/romanticized viewpoint.](#spoiler)\n\n3. The ending: Everything's been about her this whole time, so why stop now? [Doesn't matter where he is, she's reading it as his revenge on her, but he could've just gotten a flat tire somewhere, ironically.

I have a question. [When Susan calls up her daughter after the the one in the novel is raped and murdered is it just her losing grip on reality? Her daughter was laying naked in the same position as the dead character in the book. She had already had the abortion and I don't remember any mentions of her having one with her current husband. We see her starting blur reality when she imagines the killer in her co-worker's home nursery. Could be the reason why she doesn't imagine herself as the wife in the novel, she was to ashamed to imagine the daughter she could of had?](#spoiler)", "Anyone get the impression that Susan's phone call with her \"daughter\" in real life was imagined? The quick cut from the dead, naked body in the novel's storyline to the same one on the bed seems to anchor the two scenes outside of reality.  I don't think the movie really makes a whole lot of sense had she not followed through with the abortion. I did not get the impression that her and Armie Hammer would have had a kid around the same timeline, and correct me if I'm wrong but the \"daughter\" is never brought up by anyone in the real world outside of that phone conversation.  We know that Susan hardly sleeps so I don't think we can take every event that occurs in her reality at face value.", "I love how the revenge factor was soooo subtle and not as strong as how Amy Dunne did in Gone Girl.

The 3 narratives are expertly woven together with great pacing and the choices made on when and how to cut away to another plotline is immaculate. Every performance in this film is full of subtle mannerisms and actions that really bring the characters to life with the stand out being Amy Adams who is magnificent. Also Aaron Taylor-Johnson deserves at least an Oscar nomination for his transformative performance. The cinematography is extremely impressive as the DP Seamus McGarvey has to shoot a bleak and stark neo-noir, a romance and a psychological thriller without the transitions being jarring and he pulls it off brilliantly. The narratives are gripping and the way they run parallel with each other using similar themes and events to convey how the main characters feel to the audience is masterful. Also this is one of my favourite endings to a film in a while. Nocturnal Animals is one of my favourite and one of the best films I've seen in quite a long time.", "Tremendous film but here's a question I've been pondering over:\n[Did Susan make herself believe that Edward was emailing her as a way to cope with the \"terrible thing\" she did to him? It's almost like she knew he wasn't going to show to dinner after she read the ending of the book. This can be seen and heard with the heartbeat slowing down and stopping to represent what she had done to him internally and emotionally. So getting the email in the middle of the night (while she was wide awake clearly thinking) was her way to try to ease her guilt. She did stay for an awfully long time, which was maybe a way to cling onto any chance of Edward showing which would mean automatic forgiveness from Edward. So with that being said, I personally think Edward sent her the book as a \"fuck you\" and never communicated with her in any other way whatsoever.](#spoiler)", "I just watched this film and found it macabrely stunning.

I'm aware this is a little much, but the whole film feels dreamy and surreal.] (#spoiler)\n\n", "What the fuck.....honestly I thought the movie was garbage....", "I enjoyed this movie as depressing and devastating as it was. The only real gripe is that I felt the dialogue in the trailer at the end was poorly done and drawn out a bit too much. It sounded unnatural and took me out of the moment. I guess a minor quibble would be that I caught the multiple shadows in a night scene indicative of the artificial lighting. :P \n\nEverything in the movie felt it was supposed to leave you with raw negative emotions whether it was disgust, horror, sadness, pain, grief.

Or was the soundtrack *really* inspired by the [Vertigo OST](https://youtu.be/kC5AzFc3coo?t=2m12s) at some points?", "I have an unconventional take on what the characters and ending in Edward's novel represent.\n\nTony Hastings & Family:\n\n[To me, Tony Hastings doesn't represent Edward, but instead is meant to be Susan.  That means Laura Hastings is Edward, and India Hastings is the aborted child of Susan and Edward.  More reasoning on this in the next sections.](#spoiler)\n\nThe Ray Marcus gang:\n\n[This is Susan's \"fate\".  I put fate in quotes because I don't believe it to be unavoidable destiny, with good judgement and strength it can be deterred.  Fate comes at Susan seemingly out of nowhere, just like Tony runs into it while driving down a straight road.  In the novel, Tony is too weak, fearful, and incapable of fighting off the gang.  Similar to how fate overpowers Susan when she is unwilling to work on her relationship with Edward or face her fear of becoming an actual artist rather than just a promoter.  Susan's mother even warned her it would happen eventually, that she would turn into what she used to despise.  When that prediction came true, it cost Susan a spouse and a child, much like Ray Marcus took Tony's spouse and child.](#spoiler)\n\nDetective Andes:\n\n[Detective Andes represents Susan's 2nd husband, Hutton.  Edward wrote Andes as an emotionless dying man, while Hutton turned out to be unfaithful and losing everything professionally.  Now, Edward didn't actually know Hutton, so creating an analogous character in Andes was either foresight or wishful thinking.  Either way, I feel they match.  Andes offered Tony a glimmer of hope during his tragedy, and Hutton did the same for Susan.   Andes promises revenge, Hutton lust/materialism, both of which are fleeting and ultimately unfulfilling.](#spoiler)\n\nEnding:\n\n[Tony eventually finds and takes out Ray, but it leaves him with no sight, no future, and so weak that he falls on his gun, killing himself.  Similarly, Susan pinpoints her \"fate\".  She hates her job, has an absent husband, and is losing grip on her life.  As desperate as Tony's attempt at vigilante justice, Susan sets a meeting with Edward, obviously with romantic intentions based on her dress/makeup.  After sadly waiting hours until it's clear he won't show, Susan sees absolutely no way forward (blinded), and the single tear down her cheek is her figurative death.  Life has now played out exactly as Edward wrote it.  The kicker in this theory is that early in their relationship, Susan complained that Edward was always writing about himself.](#spoiler)", "Hugely disappointed personally. My feelings about this one can best be summarised in the sentence \"I see what you tried to do there\"", "It's pretty clear to me that the book never existed.  Susan, in her sleep-deprived state, concocted the story in her own head, and it was an exact parallel to her situation with Edward and its subsequent influence on her life.  It's very Wizard of Oz-esque in that sense.  I would guess that Edward killed himself years ago - perhaps accidentally, like in the story, via an overdose or something - or perhaps with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  \n\nEdward's revenge wasn't the authoring of this book; his revenge came when Susan finally realized how correct he was about everything, in that the life she chose to pursue proved to be one of emptiness and hollowness.  He was even correct about her having art inside of her (in the form of the story), although it took a horrible sequence of events to unearth it.  It turned out that Edward was her inspiration, as opposed to vice versa like she reads in the [imagined] note from Edward.  \n\nIn the story, Susan is represented by Ray.  I think the most telling reference is when Ray says something to the effect of, \"When someone accuses me of something, that gives me permission to do it.\"  Well, Susan's mother told her that she was going to rip Edward's heart out, so she did it.  Just like in the story, she took away his wife (her) and their child.\n\nThe only think I'm a little loose on is the fact that I think Detective Andes represents Hutton.  He appeared to represent something (an embodiment of honorable law) different than what he actually was in real life , and he - through his immoral actions - helped Edward exact his ultimate revenge, just as Hutton - in a roundabout way - assisted Edward (by failing to make Susan happy in life).

Ford is (to be expected) a gifted visual artist but that\u2019s all this really amounted to, a visual art piece for a mediocre character study.

The novel tells Susan that Edward doesn't blame her for what happened, just as Tony's wife was in no way to blame, but that instead he solely blames Hutton and seeks his revenge, which he admits he is blinded by, on him.

", "2/10, fuck Tom Ford", "Just got home from this film. I'm on mobile so please excuse the lazy writing. \n\nIt was good. I'm just going to vomit out some of my random thoughts and observations:\nJust got home from this film.\n\nIt was good. I'm just going to vomit out some of my random thoughts and observations:\n\nMain themes: heteronormative and gender societal constructs, parent/child relationships, revenge\n\nI'll start with what I thought the chief theme was: Gender roles and masculinity/femininity.\n-Edward Sheffield exhibits a struggle with masculinity - it's revealed that in his childhood he lacked a father figure, he takes up creative writing as his education which is a feminine career, there's also this recurring discussion about him and weakness. He's not an archetypal male provider with his writing income causing Susan to leave him for a wealthier and seemingly more \"successful\" man who can provide. Hutton Morrow is tall, handsome, rich and successful. Armie Hammer excels in this character well but I can only imagine he's tired of playing this role: from gossip girl, to Winklevoss on the social network and now to Hutton Morrow. Hutton is a rich, handsome, masculine womanizing businessman. But his main claim to success, his business, is revealed to be failing. So beyond his appearance, he's emasculated. Sheffield's novel is his retribution and his medium of validation. He portrays himself in his novel which is important and meaningful. It allows him to define himself. He's seen as weak, not being able to sacrifice himself and protect his family from 3 nocturnal animals like a man should at the beginning. Some important imagery is when we see him in a flannel and ample facial hair, which are archetypes of masculinity, and in it he's pushed around by 3 guys and rendered defenseless and weak. Only after he loses his wife and daughter does the facial hair come off which mirrors his real life character - always depicted without facial hair or beard. The scene of Tony in the shower is an inflection point in this portrayal - it's the point where he washes those constructs away. Sheffield rejects the notion that he's weak, this is probably something he's struggled with his whole life trying to prove himself. Then his character, Tony, validates his masculinity and removes his \"weakness\" by killing his nemesis in a variation of a Texas standoff, the manliest duel. He then shoots his gun in the air in celebration and then promptly dies with a feeling of contentment. There's irony in that character death. The setting of Texas, acts as a great character foil and thematic foil. Texas is a state that embodies masculinity - from cowboy culture, to football, to guns, etc. Susan references her gay brother who has had to deal with a similar struggle. She admires her brother \"Cooper\" I think is his name and and once admired and respected Sheffield for those same traits. The 3 bad guys, were actually small in stature and juvenile and boyish in appearance yet they are the grotesque and inhuman men. This is Ford's meditation on what makes a man and what a man looks like - it's not the stereotypical Texas tough guy or rich man making business deals. It's a man who has the courage to believe in his craft, in his art, in himself. I bet Ford sees a lot of himself in his character. In fact Ford has childhood roots in Texas. Ford is also inspired by minimalism. The seminal art of Prada Marfa I think was an inspiration for the film and for Ford. Prada Marfa is a pop art sculpture replica of the famous and influential fashion house, Prada's, retail store situated in a obscure area near Marfa Texas alongside a vast middle-of-nowhere road. In such a desolate area devoid of the trappings of high culture, there's this exhibit of modern minimalist art, a Prada store. This tension and irony and dichotomy is kind of paralleled in the novel, Nocturnal Animals. Like A Single Man there's ample minimalism porn throughout the film. Minimalism is a great vessel to encapsulate Ford's discussion on his characters' relationships. The most masculine character we see is Detective Bobby and internally he's facing a battle with weakness and emasculation - he's dying of cancer but also he's lonely. He's without any family or love in his life and thus he's willing to risk it all. In critical moments, he's hacking up a cough and rendered defenseless - always relinquishing his gun, to Tony. Ford alludes to some social commentary with guns and how they apply to male culture and act as masculine security blankets if you will. In the movie they are used as tools to force opponents into submission, but they are tools that are depicted as defeated or overcome when the bad guys are able to escape. Also, it's really important how the trio of rapist murderers did not use a gun in their hijacking. It's unrealistic, especially in Texas, for none of them to be carrying, but the lack of gun or weapon is a meaningful void. Moreover, whenever one of the trio are isolated from a group, he's depicted as weak and defenseless. We first see Lou alone while he's arrested and in custody. We first see Ray Marcus alone when he's naked and vulnerable on a toilet. This is Ford's meditation on the grotesque and evil patriarchy which thrives only in numbers and as a collective. \n\n-I knew right of the bat this movie would center around gender/heteronormative deconstruction and their roles in relationships when we were early on introduced to a non-traditional relationship of a gay man married to a woman. It was a good foreshadowing of the Morrow relationship - these aren't relationships founded in love, they're symbiotic relationships - mutualistic, parasitic, and commensal. Susan Morrow faces this constant struggle between living an authentic life of love and then living an empty life of wealth and easiness. She's battling with gender norms. Her mother embodies female traditionalism - \"a man should be a provider of women.\" It's easy to pick up on this dichotomy when Susan harps on about being practical and a realist. Notice also how the happiest and earliest depiction of Susan is her without makeup. Like beards and facial hair, makeup is another gendered archetype, but of femininity. The scene where she's reflecting on herself in the mirror and removes her typical makeup and lipstick and \"relaxes\" her look to be more authentic when she's getting ready to meet up with Edward again at the restaurant is powerful. She's hoping that this is her chance to feel a life of love and fulfillment again. She's removing superficiality and returning to authenticity and love - which she now lacks in her revealed unhappy life. Recall how when Susan's friend pointedly asks her if she loved Hutton. Conveniently, she escapes from the question.  Susan's biggest fear is turning into her mother. Throughout the movie we see this mother/daughter motif - with the two dead bodies laying next to each other, then quickly transitioned to the scene of Susan's daughter laying naked in the bed in the same position. I think Susan's biggest fear on the phone is that her daughter will be as unhappy as her - that her daughter would become her daughter's mother. However, Susan's daughter is obviously in love and speaks on the phone with a tone of happiness, comfort, and content which is juxtaposed to Susan's worried, scared and dreadful tone.  The mother/daughter dichotomy reaches a climactic point when Susan runs into her coworker who shows her a video feed of her baby daughter and becomes frightened from a horrific visualization. Susan Morrow is not in paradise. She's in sorrow with her relationship with Hutton and her closely similar surname reflects that. She's sad, lonely, not in love, and even sexless. She can't run from this *reality* of her life either. Which was alluded briefly in the beginning when she was unable to turn off the tv that was playing sex programming and talking about how cum had the consistency of coconut water. On the outside, Susan Morrow has it all, a nice house a handsome and rich husband, but there are now coconuts in Susan's \"paradise\" as the couple is going broke, sexless, and facing marriage difficulties. She longs to experience this idea of tropical paradise too as she begs to go to the beach with her husband who declines. Edward once told her when two people are in love they must try to make it work. She didn't believe in that then and now Susan is stuck in her own prison of not being in love or happy with a guy who she knows is cheating on her and trying to make it work. \n\nA lot of people in this thread are really focusing on revenge as a theme, and yes, it's a theme but I don't think it's the most important. There is deeper and richer meaning within Nocturnal Animals. \n\nLastly, is the importance of the title. Obviously he 3 hijacker rapist murderers are nocturnal animals. But nocturnal animals applies more broadly to all humans - and is really a depiction of the human condition. We are animals, and at night we are nocturnal. Susan is a nocturnal animal plagued with nightmares, and unable to sleep. Edward is a nocturnal animal, writing  away his redemption novel. Detective Bobby is a nocturnal animal, lonely and savage. Hutton is a nocturnal animals always escaping away and having sex with women besides his wife. Ford really conveyed the animalistic side of humans.\n\nThe only gripe I have about Ford is that his techniques seem a little too filmschool studenty. He has visually stunning cinematography and a penchant for aesthetics and picture which is great but he uses techniques sometimes in too literal of a way. I had the same gripe about A Single Man. It needs to be more seamless and fit in with the whole production rather than come off as forced, contrived and hastily included. ", "I really loved the film, but thought it came off as a bit too pretentious at times. Also, am I the only one who arguably thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson was the standout performance? I mean, Adams was fine, but nothing compared to Arrival, and Gyllenhaal was superb, but not Villeneuve's level. Meanwhile, Michael Shannon had screen presence, but was restricted to me. \n\n[Quickee Film Review ](http://quickee-film-time.tumblr.com/post/154261657861/when-you-love-someone-you-work-it-out-you-dont)", "Quick question, is Amy Adams a smoking hot in this movie as she is in the /r/movies title bar?

So who was that girl (her daughter?) she called on the phone? Was that Jake Gyllenhal's daughter or the other guy? ", "All the actors have blue eyes. ", "Just saw this movie and where I'm at with it in this moment can be summed up into this sentence: We let the real things we love turn us into the fake things we hate ", "\"Nocturnal Animals\" is incredibly executed in bridging together the parallel storylines, a task that is especially impressive given the tonal/genre shifts from story to story, to how the separate plots are paced out individually, as well as intercut with each other.\nThe acting is exactly what you; complete believability that is immersive, in particular order the stand outs are Michael Shannon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Aaron Taylor Johnson and Amy Adams. I reluctantly place Mrs. Adams on the end of my list, knowing full well that this may have more to do the with the restrictions put on her character Susan (from a writing stand point) whereas the other actors are given more scenes that have a lot more meat to chew on.\nMicheal Shannon, will probably be a favorite to win best supporting actor and Gyllenhaal most certainly deserves a nomination for best male lead. Both of these actors, consistently give it their all in bringing a character to life and this film is exemplary of that. Shannon's dry delivery and no nonsense demeanor became a well placed reservoir of dark humor throughout the film. Gyllenhaal, smartly knew how to infuse his multiple characters with the vulnerable indignation (for one role) and a helpless anger (for that other) that lived in harmony, thanks in addition, to the deft story structure. I've only seen Aaron Taylor Johnson in Kick Ass, but if I had any doubts about this ability to be terrify and psychotic in a role, than I'm gladly eating my hat now.\nThe film was shot in 35mm and looked spectacular, with a very specific esthetic that was based in commercial photography (during the Amy Adams sequences) that sometimes made me feel like I was a vintage perfume ad from 90's (I mean that in the best way possible!). When the film switched over to the thriller storyline, Ford and crew (DP Seamus McGarvey lensed \"The Avengers\") were just as confident in capturing the impotent dread one may feel in desolate locations far removed from \"civil\" society. The editing as well was at times, deliberate (re: slow) and calculated, sparingly snapping to quick cutaway at a few keys moments for devastating effect. The clever use of continuity editing (a gesture begins in one shot and ends in the next shot) to help the transitions from the parallel storylines---and the repetition of some very basic blocking with different characters (as simple as that may sound) had an incredibly playful effect to me, especially when it turn that technique on its head to undermined the viewers expectation.\nSince this is a film by Tom Ford; this short note wouldn't be complete without a few words on the makeup and wardrobe. The makeup/hair extensions used to make Adams and Gyllenhaal look 20 years younger (along with the help of some digital effects clean up) look flawless. The wardrobe choices for Adams gallery curator, stood out the most (some for their beauty, others for their gaudiness)--along with her work/social colleagues, but isn't that what you'd expect from high society art elitists?\nFinal analysis: For me, the film takes as it muse the heartbreak of loss and how that emotion can manifest in our lives or be repressed in some cases, and how making \"art\" out of that loss--can help both cases come to an undeniable understanding.\nI'd recommend this film if you're a fan of the following films: \"Adaptation\" by Spike Jonze, \"Synecdoche, New York \" by Charlie Kaufman, \"Twenty Nine Palms\" by Bruno Dumont, \"Breakdown\" with Kurt Russell and anything with a splash of Hitchcock and a pinch of David Lynch and a dash of Wong Kar Wai.\n", "This movie was absolute garbage one the most boring movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The critics who gave this movie such high ratings need to publicly apologize to movie goers everywhere for misleading them. The movie never picks up the pace after the suspense end 30mins into the movie then you realize you still have another hour and a half of torture left to watch knowing it's not going to get any better. I'm warning you to skip this over hyped movie.", "I'm going to have the unpopular opinion here and say that this movie was crap. The \"novel narrative\" was far more interesting than the \"main narrative\" which either ended up being annoying or just plain stupid. The acting for the most part was stale and the dialogue was mostly just clumsy. The only exceptions to those two come in the \"novel narrative\" which has some excellent performances by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Michael Shannon. \n\nUltimately, it felt pretentious, clunky, badly paced, horribly edited and it really lacked in tone. I feel and sound like a douche, and a cinema snob (like the character) but I actually found myself sniggering and chuckling at the movie's dumbest or worst moments. For example, the jump-scare scene where Amy Adams is watching the baby monitor and Aaron Taylor-Johnson appears was a genuine eye-roller for me. Again, I hate to be like that, but if a film is going out of its own way to prove to me it's smart, cool or original and then it farts out something like that, I'm going to mock it.", "This movie was bad, real bad. Like holy fuck bad. Useless and pointless. The only slight saving grace was the acting of Michael Shannon. \n\nUsually a substance-less movies have great visuals and cinematography, or a bad story will have great action...

A mix of Cormac McCarthy, David Lynch and Refn. The only major complaint I have other than the editing is that I found the \"book\"'s story in the film much more compelling than Amy Adam's storyline.\n\nI almost would have preferred a full, McCarthy style revenge film with Gyllenhaal, Shannon and Aaron Taylor Johnson.\n\nI would give it a firm 6.5/10.", "Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal? Where is Denis Villeneuve?", "1. What was the point of the weird intro scene?  I really don't understand it.\n\n2.

We are who we are: where we were born, who we were born as, how we were raised. We're kind of stuck inside that person, and the purpose of civilization and growth is to be able to reach out and empathize a little bit with other people. And for me, the movies are like a machine that generates empathy. It lets you understand a little bit more about different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears.

The way that these events are so small and to others would just have been another day. When Chiron gets lunch and dinner from Juan, when Kevin tells him that story of having sex in the staircase, to the second to last scene when Chiron is nestled in Kevin's neck. These moments are so modernist that it may seem cliche but I think it's saying something. That the tiny parts of our lives are so important to who we are and become. And yes other movies emphasize this notion but they have to emphasize them, Moonlight let it happen, it showed what needed to be showed and nothing else. no frills. A truly masterful film. ", "A lot of people talking about how this is a very touching and important movie of gay people. I deinfinitly agree. I think it was a perfect choice for this film because of how negatively homosexuality has been viewed in the past. Especially in relation to masculinity.\n\nBut I found the movie to be very easy to relate to as a heterosexual man as well. The idea of having difficulty opening yourself up to others isn't specific to any one sexualtiy. Of course I understand that being heterosexual is still more commonly seen as normal where as being gay is sometimes still viewed as abnormal, so it was a great choice for the story the movie was trying to tell.\n\nI guess I'm trying to say that the movie was much deeper then just, how do I come to terms with being a gay man?", "It's immediately clear that the character in the third act is *not* Chiron. That's not who he is. It's not just the muscles and the grill, either, which are clearly a costume for his insecurity. It's also the scene where he fucks with the guy who was pushing drugs for him in that super-douchey, masculine way. He thinks that this is how he has to act, how he has to treat others, and how he has to be in order to be accepted/be a man. It's almost like he has no choice.\n\nIn terms of nature vs nurture, it's very clear that the Chiron in the third act (until the end) is a product of nurture. That's the saddest part of the film to me, him feeling like he has to be someone he's very clearly not because of nothing other than the environment he was happened to be born into.", "\nThis film is a masterpiece in my opinion, It\u2019s a lot more surreal than I was expecting, very slow paced with this dreamlike tone. All three versions of the protagonist are incredible and overall the film features some of the best acting of the year. t I love the way the director films black skin. It feels so luminous and beautiful. The film has gorgeous lighting, with fantastic uses of the colors blue and purple. I was especially surprised with the music. It has a ton of variety and every song choice is just dead on perfect. This is one of those films that just envelopes you in its style but has such a deep heart that it never feels overly stylish. It\u2019s too bad pretty much all the acting besides Naomi Harris and maybe Marshella Ali will get ignored, only because there\u2019s so many small but powerful performances because of the way it was structured. Also how perfect was the naming of the three time periods and the way his identity changed through each. \n\nTwo sidenotes. One, it wasn't till after I saw the film that I understood how well done [the poster is.](http://www.blackfilm.com/read/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Moonlight-poster.jpg) Two, I find it interesting that both this film and To Pimp a Butterfly start with the song [\"Every Nigger is a Star\" by Boris Gardiner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYnenIWZjwE). Guess if something starts with that song you know you are in for quality.

We all want to be who we are without having to put up some facade.  The last scene had me bawling my eyes out.  I was so happy for both of them.  I've never had a movie affect me like this.  We all want to be who we are and to be loved for it.  What an absolutely beautiful film.  I really feel that this movie was robbed at the Golden Globes.  While La La land is a nice film the emotion Moonlight invokes isn't comparable.", "It's really hard to intellectualize why I loved this movie.

The rules were: whoever picked the ball up was labeled the Queer and everybody else chased them and tackled them. We see Chiron never pick up the ball.

I think what really struck me about this film, is all of the actors and directors understood the power of silence.

I love that this movie was focused on a more specific story (Chirons sexuality) and didn't spend time showing us how Juan died, or how shitty it was for him in Juvie in Atlanta. We don't need to see those things. Chiron says he hasn't had relations with anybody since he did with Kevin, so the movie stays on that thread. I thought it was extremely well done. ", "Did people laugh throughout anyone else's showing? My theater was packed and you would have thought we were watching a comedy. I thought some parts were funny. But I was a little disappointed when everyone would laugh at scenes that, had the film starred a heterosexual man, probably would have garnered no laughter at all. I think people felt uncomfortable? I don't know. Saw it with my dad and he was puzzled by the laughter as well.", "I watched this movie last night in Taiwan. I am not American. By the end of the movie, I was drained from all the things all the characters had to go through. In mainstream American media, many people talked about how black people in America couldn't get out of the hood, the sentiment is amplified by the Black Lives Matter movement. After watching this movie I finally understood what that meant. \n\nRestraint is a common theme in every act, every scene in Moonlight. The moment a character lets loose and try to do what they want, everything goes wrong. Juan talked about the old lady told him that at a certain point they have to choose what they have to be -- but in the end, did they choose based on what they want in their heart, or their environment closed the doors and forced them to choose the few roads they don't want to? A bullying incident went wrong destroyed the lives of every party involved. When the teacher was coaxing Chiron to press charges against the boys who bullied him, he knew that if he did it would destroy Kevin's life. He chose to remain silent. But his own rage took over him, and he made that one mistake. \n\nAll it takes is one mistake, one wrong decision, and the paths ahead of them changed forever. Is society that unforgiving to black people? How did it become that way? Should it be that way? How do we change that today? \n\nThe movie presented three snapshots of Chiron's life. The movie did not need to show us every scene, but just through the dialogue alone, we could feel the gravity of the moment and picture what happened in between, flashing through in our minds just like how the characters were experiencing it at that moment, which made it even more powerful. The only time Chiron was happy, when he felt that someone was there for him, was when Juan taught him to swim. Chiron had a father figure -- albeit for a brief moment before he was betrayed. Theresa was more of a mother for him than his own mother Paula, who was battling with addiction. /r/raisedbynarcissists would have a lot to say about Paula. But even Theresa was aware of her awkward identity, being the wife of the man who sold drugs to Chiron's mother. Chiron's relationship with Kevin is one that is universal -- such a simple love for one another, but because of the social norms placed on them, they couldn't express those feelings, or rather they don't know how to, even until the end of the movie. \n\nMovies exploring black culture,  masculinity, sexuality, drug abuse, family, relationships are dime a dozen, but Moonlight weaved them together in such a poetic manner, it's beautiful yet so heart-wrenching at the same time. To me, this movie is great because every single character felt real, even though such a movie had not been attempted before in cinemas, let alone winning Oscars.  \n\nOther commenters here mentioned the last scene was absolutely beautiful, and I agree wholeheartedly. After almost everyone around him who he trusted turned against him, Chiron finally opened up to someone to trust again, even just for a moment. Kevin showed him that there's a life outside of the hood, the hustling, albeit a simple one, he is *free*. Perhaps Kevin would be Chiron's salvation, and let him live the life where he could be Little again, free to bask in the moonlight and be beautiful and blue.", "As a mid 20's gay (closeted) black male, this movie hits me where it hurts. I've repressed myself for as long as I can remember, having to put up fronts and 'be hard' is no way to live. Beautifully acted! The cast did an amazing job. The scene that stood out to me the most is when we see Chiron dancing in class. That was one small moment where he truly was himself and genuinely seemed happy.", "The third act was lesser than the first two, but still it's comparing a 9/10 act to 2 10/10's. Movie of the year hands down", "I really wanted to like this film more than I did, but I couldn't get into it like I wanted. Don't get me wrong, this is still one of the best films I've seen this year (I'd put it slightly behind Arrival & HoHW), but I couldn't get as emotionally invested as I wanted. Maybe it's because the giant skips in time made character development a little tricky, or because I felt like the most dimensional character was Juan, and not Chiron. They gave Chiron a bunch of events to define him, instead of actually building a character behind those events. Essentially, I'm very reactive to films typically, and this movie didn't make me feel as much as I expected. I felt bad for Chiron like I would an injured person on the news. I didn't feel terribly acquainted with him. I'm sure I'm in the minority on this, but those are my thoughts. And to add, I thought the third act was incredible. I struggled up until then, and then with the lack of support for it.", "I just really hope the actors and producers of this movie get the credit they deserve for putting together such a great film, and it doesn't get overlooked for being \"a black movie\" or \"a movie about gay people\".", "There wasn't a single thing I didn't like about this movie. Black and I, we're so so different, and so so so much the same. This is the kind of movie to remind you how deep humanity runs in us all, that despite where we're from or what we look like, *being human* has so many universal struggles for all of us.\n\nI'm not gay, and I'm not black, but I can genuinely say I fully understand how Black feels *at every moment in this movie*, from first hand experience.\n\nMy favorite film of the year. My favorite film for a long time.", "I have a thought on the third part. I think Chiron became a drug dealer because he looked up to Juan (Mahershala Ali's character) Juan was the closest to a father figure he ever had and the only decent person he had met during his youth (along with Teresa) But what convinces me the most about this is the scene where Chiron asks him if he's a drug dealer and if his mother did drugs to which he answers with the truth. He chose to be a decent human being to Chiron even if it meant Chiron would think he was a scumbag, and that's everything Chiron really needed during that time of his life.\n\nI love this movie because it's full of stuff like this, it suggests without telling. It lets you know just what you need and then lets everything out for you to discern. Some of its scenes are all built with images rather than with words; in fact, it has very little dialogue. This is a true achievement of filmmaking and is what I wish for future films to be. \n\nYeah, I know \"DAE TELLING THROUGH CINEMATOGRAPHY\" is nothing new, but this movie does it splendidly. And along with the visuals, the acting, the music, the directing, and such which were all also amazingly done this film doesn't fall short from great.\n\nWhoever says this is oscarbait SJW stuff is a straight up moron", "I noticed after seeing the film that the poster is literally all three of the actors merged into one face. I thought it was just Black but you can see the color themes for Shiron and Little as well. I really loved the sense of emptiness that the film had at certain points where there were almost voids of sound and it left a lot of interpretation up to me as the viewer.", "This movie is very important to me. It opened my eyes to see things as they are for what has pretty much been staring me in the face all this time. I hope that because of this movie we finally get to see an issue be talked about that I haven't really seen many people discussing, which of course is, how fine Janelle Monae is..... In all seriousness though this was a great movie that I'm still thinking about after a week which is rare to me these days. 25% of those thoughts are about Janelle Monae though....", "The issue for me was way more deep than his sexual choice, it's about his loneliness and how he is boxed up and isolated with no support amidst pressure and strife from all corners of his life. You would think him in high school would have committed suicide or reached breaking point. And we saw he reached the latter which took him to jail. Masterful film, I say that as a black heterosexual man who had suffered with depression, so I could feel his pain. Just like homesexuality,the black community isn't ready for issues like mental health ", "I saw this movie 3 weeks ago and I don't think a day has gone by where I haven't thought about it. It is incredible on every level, especially the acting ( I really hope Naomi Harris gets an oscar nod for it). This will easily finish the year in my top 5, in a year that I think has been very very good in terms of movies.", "[deleted]", "I very much hope this wins Best Picture. It is by far the most meaningful and relevant film out of all the nominees. I'm not black, poor, nor gay but I still really sympathized deeply with Chiron's struggle. Very well directed, exquisitely acted, and masterfully directed. It's really between this and La La Land for best picture, which will likely win. But I'd also be satisfied if Manchester by the Sea won, or even Hell or High Water. ", "This is the only film that I have given 10/10 to this year so far (still gotta see La La Land). Barry Jenkins takes such a quiet story and gives it so much life. Each shot was beautifully done and conveyed so much emotion. There wasn't ever a scene of bad acting; everyone was on their game.  I hope Mahershala Ali gets a supporting nom. He deserves it so much. \n\nOne thing that I loved about this film was how he humanized the characters. Juan wasn't just a drug dealer; Chiron's mom wasn't just an addict; Jenkins gave them so many layers to show that there's more to someone than meets the eye. Incredibly smart and well done. ", "This film is definitely not what I expected it to be. I went in prepared for an interesting narrative and gained so much more. Its a surreal, at times dream like, story, that is visually highly stylized. For example much of the shots are shot in very shallow depth of focus, the lighting is very vibrant and colorful. \n\nWhat stood out the most were the shots of the individual characters in close ups, of which their are many. Just the way the faces were framed was very interesting, the camera work in general was the best I have seen all year. \n\nThe ending is not predictable and leaves the audience wondering, thinking and guessing. Will watch it a second time to really enjoy it. \n\nEDIT: I might add that the editing of this film is fantastic. Oftentimes we stay longer than usual on shots of individuals, which really lets the audience process the emotions of the scenes. \n\nThe style of the film in general reminded me slightly of Malik-esque", "Movie of the year.", "Saw it for the second time tonight. I rarely, if ever, go see a film twice in the theater, but I didn't regret it one bit. Just as powerful as the first time around. It might be one of my favorite films of all time. ", "It felt like I was watching parts of my childhood. Things that I had forgotten, things that I had buried in order to survive. The night I watched it I didn't get to bed until 3am. I was furiously reading reviews, just to see if I was just over reacting because I over related. But I wasn't. I am happy to see that it touched other people in similar ways though for not the same reasons. \n\n", "I know im a month late but just wanted to chime in especially after its win. This was a very daring film.Definetly one of the top films I've ever seen. Little is pretty much every gay boy growing up not knowing what gay is but being constantly bellitled because of it. Juan is exceptionally kind to him and a father figure. I feel like teen Chiron beat the bully to such extreme because of his love for Kevin.  In that environment black was who he had to become, that or a victim to the drugs like his mom. I actually loved that they didn't have intercourse at the end the intimacy was more resounding and I like that black wasn't killed, often in gay films the end is homicide or suicide so really appreciated the ending. Saw this movie in upstate NY at a film center so a very liberal audience but I could see how some audiences might be uncomfortable with a film like this.", "I had such an indifferent feeling to this film once it ended. I enjoyed the first two acts, but the third just dragged on for a resolution that I really didn't find satisfying. ", "Man that was amazing. Even without relating to the subject matter, it still moved me more than any film in a long time. I wanted to crawl through the screen and tell Chirone it's not his fault.", "It's a testament to how good Mahershala Ali was in Moonlight that despite only being in the first act, and being among a bevy of ~~good~~ amazing performances that he stands out as the most memorable. Everyone was so good in this movie though, damn...", "[deleted]", "I didn't get this movie. I was blown away by the cinematography, blown away by the raw world and the acting but end of the day, I was completely bored. I just don't get it.", "I'm amazed at how well the different actors managed to capture the look, mannerisms, and subtleties of their characters as they aged. In a very nuanced way. From facial movements to posture to the way they spoke. I totally bought each actor change as they were getting older as being the same character. If you had told me this was a Boyhood type movie and those were the same guy playing the character in all three acts, I could believe you. I'm curious which was the template the other 2 had to work from. Like did older Black have to play off how Lil's actor portrayed the character or vice versa, I wonder.", "I know I'm late to the party but I just got done seeing this and I can't stop thinking about it!\n\nAct 3 was so deep yet touching because while Chiron was clearly hitting the weight room based on his physique, to me he was still the shy, lanky kid who was trying to find himself.\n\nAlmost teared up at the scene where Chiron and his mom were crying at the rehab center too. Naomie Harris hit it out of the park with her role as well.\n\nDefinitely plan on buying this once it comes out and while I was hoping to see more of Mahershala Ali in the movie, I felt like he filled his role perfectly.\n\nI'm so in my feelings right now that I can't even explain them in words. Such an amazing and emotional film!", "Maybe I'm the only one...but the scene that broke me down was when Chiron was young. The scene when his surrogate father (the drug dealer) and him were sitting at the table. When Chiron asks him if his mom does drugs, then asks if he is a drug dealer. The expression on Juan's face just killed me. It truly broke his heart to have to admit to young Chiron that he is part of the reason why his life is in shambles (in that he is involved with supplying drugs to people like his mother). Chills.", "I love the final scene where Kevin and Chiron are holding each other and it cuts to Little standing on the beach at night, facing away from the camera at the ocean, bathed in moonlight. And then he turns and looks up at the moon. It's a reference to the scene where Juan and him go swimming and Juan talks about how he got his nickname \"blue\" from a lady who saw him in the moonlight and he says \"at some point you gotta decide for yourself who you wanna be. You can't let nobody make that decision for you.\"\n\nThe moonlight plays as a metaphor for what people see in others and how they define others by it. Little, the child inside Chiron, finally sees the moon. It is the internal representation of when Black and Kevin embrace in the final scene. It is as if to say the external depiction, the false identity is recognized and thus rendered useless in this final act of love. Black becomes who he is, rather than letting his identity define him like he has for so long, even since he was Little.\n\nI also find it interesting that in astrology, Chiron is a sign representative of \"the wounded healer\" who, in mythology could not heal himself. That Chiron needs such closure with Kevin is a sign that he needed Kevin to help heal him. Also, in the symbol for Chiron, there's a 'K' attached to an 'O'. The symbolism is abundant.", "Boyhood is one of my favorite movies of all time.\n\nThat being said, Moonlight feels like Boyhood with a clearly defined story arc. Barry Jenkins just bowled a strike.", "I just watched this and I can't stop thinking about it. The dinner table scene with Juan had me in tears where little confronted him about selling drugs to his mom. Juan's reactions to his questioning was very moving. \n\nAlso the diner scene with adult Kevin and black moved me to tears. \n\nI went into this movie blind and man it snuck up on me. I will definitely be re- watching this down the road and it will be a purchase. ", "Masterpiece.\n\nA beautiful coming of age movie and a potent deconstruction of masculinity.  Perfectly directed and acted that you literally feel every moment and so layered and involved with it's characters that it seems lived in. Every so often something comes along that meditates on identity and really unveils a deeper understanding of what it is to be human. This is one of those movies.", "\"You're the only man that's every touched me\"\n\nHoly fuck.  The strength from Chiron to say this out loud really struck with me.  I'm not gay but damn I felt for the dude throughout the whole film.  Having to come off as hard all the time and how negatively you're treated for being gay.  That line sealed the deal for me on the movie.  ", "I have plenty of good things to say here, but one that hasn't been said is that this movie made me really want to eat black beans and rice afterwards.", "Saw this last night...stunning. One of the best films I've seen in a *long* time. Beautifully shot, acted, scored; poignant about a whole host of heavy topics, and relatable no matter your skin color, economic standing, or sexuality. Highly recommend. ", "Knowing the professor who wrote it.\n\nThis makes me happy that so many people love it. It talks about my city and provides a real look at it better than anything I've seen in a while", "Just got out of the film. Although I liked La La Land better, this one had me throughout the entire thing. Very real and raw and moving film. The acting was incredible from every single person involved, especially the three people playing Chiron. It's crazy how well they reflected each others' mannerisms to play the same person. Also, I loved it when Chiron whacked that dude good with the chair. That guy deserved much, much worse though.\n\nEven as a straight, white dude, I felt for Chiron and even Kevin. That look they gave each other at the end in the kitchen was fantastic acting.", "just got out of it. hard to rank it but it's definitely top 3 of 2016. the ending scene was one of the most emotional things I've witnessed in a movie in a long time. I'm not black nor am I gay, but I still connected very deeply to Chiron. I suppose that's what makes it a great movie. The acting is easily the best I've seen in 2016. There was no weak link whatsoever; everyone gave an amazing performance. Even the side characters. \n\nThe way it ended was just so heartwrenching and I can't explain why. It's like the whole evening he was working up the courage to tell Kevin that. Fuck man", "[deleted]", "This movie was simply amazing. Wow, I walked in with high expectations and still walked out blown away. Masterfully crafted movie that was slow-paced but gripping as hell... I rarely cry during movies but man did I feel for the main character. Every second in the diner had me on my edge. The tension between the two after all that character development... was just amazing. Easily my favorite movie of the year.", "My father has this theory -- He believes that Chiron isn't homosexual whatsoever. He believes that from a young age, people called him a faggot (e.g. The scene where he asks Juan what a faggot is), and throughout the movie, we see that up until high school, until he finally snapped, he was called a faggot again and again and due to his weakness and innocence, he started believing it himself. \n\nAfter he went to juvi, he turned into Juan, his mentor. He got the grills, the muscles, the car and the money. He turned into a badass.  Nobody even came close to him because he got respect. He made a name for himself and everybody feared him (unlike his high school and earlier years). When he went to visit Kevin, he told him that \"no man has ever touched me\" outside of Kevin. It doesn't necessarily show that he's not a homosexual, but it does make you think -- what if he isn't a homosexual? What if genuinely doesn't feel attraction for men, but due to his past life experiences, he is forced to believe that he is? \n\nJust something to think about. ", "I just finished this. I really liked this movie. Chiron has built himself some crazy walls. I don't blame him, after what all he's gone through. Sure he went to prison, sure he's a drug dealer but he's still Chiron. A shy dude who also happens to be gay in a vein of society where being gay is probably not something you want people to know about you. To see him get some human touch at the end made my feel happy, but also melancholy. I can only imagine how alone he must have felt for so long. I just wonder if anything came of him and Kevin or if he retreated back into himself and left it at that. The final shot of him at the beach as a little kid, going back to one of the only other times he was ever happy and loved. The only good memory he revisited in the whole movie. Maybe he finally had a good dream. Anyway, I thought it was a great movie.", "> **LITTLE**\n\n> Am I a faggot? \n\n> **JUAN**\n\n> No.You're not a faggot.\n\n> You can be gay, but... you don't\n> have to let nobody call you a\n> faggot.\n\n> (beat)\n\n> Not unless...\n\nJuan looking to Teresa; Teresa shakes her head.\n\nSomeone explain this to me? What was he going to say after \"not unless\"? I feel slow for not getting it", "I like how you don't actually know much about Chiron. At the end when Kevin asks Chiron \"Who are you?\" then I was like \"...yeah, who is Chiron?\". You never get to know what Chiron likes to do, how well he did in school or anything like that. The whole story is completely centered on Chiron and only covers a few other people and it's played out on a very minimal scale, yet Chiron is a mystery throughout the whole film. And because of the time leaps you don't get to see how he reacted to Juan's death or how he handles his drug dealing when he's an adult (except for that one scene).  \n  A very interesting and captivating movie for sure.", "I totally understand why people like this movie so much but it didn't do it for me unfortunately. In my opinion it's definitely not as good as reviews say it is, but still a nice movie \n\nBest part was the casting/acting by far. The 3 actors who played each stage of Chiron's life did a great job carrying over the personality ", "I recommend to everyone who likes this movie to read some of the other plays by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who wrote the play that this movie is based on. Not everyone is in to theatre, but he has written several works that are as beautiful as this movie.\n\nIf you're interested, I'd start with The Brother/Sister Plays.", "Have not stopped raving about this film since I saw it at the Toronto international film festival in September. So glad it is connecting with audiences the way in the same way it hit me. I think Moonlight, O.J. Made in America, I'm Not Your Negro, and 13th have all done a wonderful job of bringing a genuine sense of empathy to the various aspects of the African-American experience in a way that is rarely captured on-screen. Regardless of what some may have you believe, 2016 has been a great year for cinema.\n\nFor those who loved Moonlight, I highly recommend you seek out Jenkins previous film Medicine for Melancholy (discussed it on our podcast a few weeks back: http://www.modernsuperior.com/podcasts/changing-reels-episode-6-medicine-melancholy/). While it doesn't have the same emotional gut punch of Moonlight, his debut feature film definitely lays the groundwork for what he perfects here.", "I was really impacted by the scenes of Chiron in school. He goes home, his mom is an addict and shows him no love, he is relentlessly bullied, he has no friends (except Kevin), no home life--and then he has to sit in on a science class. How is he supposed to compete academically with other kids? The absurdity of the teacher telling the class 'this is important' was blatant. \n\nAlso, the relationship between Kevin and Chiron was interesting. Even in high school, Kevin seemed to overcompensate when describing his sexual conquests to Chiron. If other kids had targeted Chiron as being gay, Kevin had to have known or seen that too. \n\nAll in all, a tragic but beautiful film. ", "Easily my top film of 2016. It 100% lives up to the hype.\n\nThe most amazing part to me is how the three actors playing Chiron all perfectly capture the same mannerisms and facial expressions, despite the fact that they never met each other during filming. So much of the story is told through their silent stares and glances, and I found the whole film to be captivating.", "it's so funny that all guys that come here and felt emotional when watching the movie have to reaffirm they're not gay lol \n\nmasculinity is so fragile that it'd be funny if not tragic ", "Brilliantly made movie. Deals with some big themes in very intimate ways. It stirred deep feelings in me and I've found myself thinking about this movie every day since I've seen it. Probably the best film of the year so far. ", "I thought it was an excellent film \u2013 the acting was ridiculously good and culturally it's both important and significant for various factors. \n\nI didn't enjoy it though, but I'm not sure I'm meant to. It raised many questions for me and exposed me to lifestyles and experiences which I would not have considered previously. I did find it very slow-moving, overplaying on silence to convey emotion, but simultaneously detaching me further from the characters. Coming from a culture and having life experiences so different to what was shown in the film made it (personally) a bit of a struggle to connect with Chiron. I did also massively struggle with Boyhood, so perhaps it's not a large surprise that I wasn't totally able to here as well.\n\nI will remember the swimming lesson scene fondly though. That was a staggering scene, and undoubtedly one of the best sequences I have seen in cinema. It was one of the rare moments in the film which totally absorbed me.", "just saw it. i wasn't a big fan. it seemed really predictable, except for when Black connects the dots about the drug dealer selling drugs to his mom. The last act became basic cause and action. He goes to prison, so he starts selling drugs. He gets a call so he goes to find his love. i was more interested in the storylines of secondary characters, but by the last act, everyone's ending all felt so rushed. Most of them just straight up disappeared. ", "Wow, you know a movie is good when this subreddit almost unanimously says so. Checking it out. Thanks everyone.", "I predict we're gonna see #OscarsSoBlack trending on Twitter thanks to this movie.", "I met with Mahershala Ali, Trevante Rhodes and Barry Jenkins at a private screening of \"Moonlight\" here in Los Angeles, all three of them are such amazing people in person.

Wow. \n\nFirst impression as the film ended? I felt absolution. Like I've been made whole and born again. And yeah, I feel this way because the 3rd part of the movie was all about forgiveness. \n\nFor me, the strength of the film was in its tone, especially the strong use of colour (sometimes even blatant lmao). The two key characters in Chiron's life, Kevin and his mom (the two people he dreams about), wear blue in most of the film. Chiron himself never directly wears blue, but he's often showed bathed in a blue glow -- whether it be in the kitchen of one of his dealers, or from neon signs outside Kevin's diner.\n\nI can see why people would think it's a boring film though. The climax had already gone before I realised it -- the chair smash scene. But for me that just kind of adds to its realistic pace -- it's not out to tell a story, but to show a life. Same thing with that final scene where kevin just holds him -- somehow i think having a Big Gay Sex scene just wouldn't sit in with the pace of the film, and I kind of like the mellowness of the open end.\n\nAs for the acting? oodles of kudos to teen chiron, awkward puberty is all gangly limbs and acne. \n\nAll in all, it's not an 'exciting' film per se, but to me it's a fascinating one!

I think that in a lot of ways it was a coming of age film, but for Chiron his realization of who he really is was stagnated by his environment and his inability to escape from a world that was telling him his sexuality was wrong and he had to be a certain type of person. I'm curious whether anyone else thought that Juan was maybe his actual father? I'm not really sure why I thought that, it was just kind of an underlying thing I thought might be there. The only thing I didn't like about the film was that we didn't really see the circumstances of Juan's death (if I remember correctly) and it felt like a loose end to me.", "This is one of the movies that will be a beloved footnote in American indie history. I won't call it a masterpiece because it isn't flawless. But damn, it really is something special. The crackhead mom in particular made me break down, because that character expressed the passage of time so well. She does shitty things, and then she learns from them when it's already too late. My only beef is the third part feels really anticlimactic, more in the way it doesn't keep the rhythm with the rest of the film. But it's as emotional a conclusion as you should expect.

I get the whole exploring sexuality thing but it just bored the hell out of me. The story really wasn't that interesting and I constantly tuned out. I get people have different opinions and all but I can't see what people see in this. Whenever I felt there was a good bit it was just glanced over. Granted I only watched it because it was best picture for the oscars and not because it was my type of film but damn I was waiting for something to happen that would make me change my opinion on it.", "I really enjoyed this film, but something about it just left me underwhelmed at the end. First and second act are absolutely masterful. I agree. But I think when you deprive the audience from dialogue, especially with your main character, you want to see his arc reached by actually speaking. \n\nFor him to simply say (and being the last line in the film), 'you're the only man who has ever touched me'. I just found that statement hard to believe especially going in prison looking as weak as he did in the second act. \n\nThe two characters needed to reevaluate the bullying scene instead of speaking with their eyes. These ain't shy kids no more, they're grown men. They've had lives spent going through prison and the other raising a family. That scene has forced Chiron to 'build himself from the ground up' so he's definitely been carrying the baggage along for too long to simply just 'try to forget about it'. This guy is a gangsta now. He carries a gun during drug deals and intimidates his friends. Kevin has to be confronted not by infatuation but through the 'false' masculinity Chiron exhibits. \n\nLet's say this; if Kevin asked him in the kitchen again why he came down to Miami, and if Chiron had said he actually planned to beat him up for what he did. The silence from something like that would have drawn a more stronger ending. The procrastination to forgive Kevin would be the ultimate acceptance of his identity which is the main issue of the film. That would make the question of 'who is you, Chiron' way more powerful. \n\nJust my two cents. 8 out of 10. ", "I had to watch this movie 5 times to get to know the \"simple\" characters like I needed to. It is not a gay movie. It is not a black movie. It's art that grapples at your inner guts, and the characters and myself become as one, because we are. It would be self folly to convince myself that this is not an artistic masterpiece. This white boy found a lot about myself in it, and I doubt that I'm the only one!", "I just saw Moonlight and it really hit home something I hadn't really considered before. I'm a white gay man, and I know I was pretty lucky growing up... But for the longest time, and even today, I still have this pre-conceived notion tied up in my head that my sexuality makes me 'less than' a straight person. I was never maliciously victimised like Chiron was, just some gentle teasing, but I still had all these ideas pent up (from movies, TV, from hearing my parents talk and hearing other kids joke) about what a gay person should and could be, and it limited the way I conducted myself. I'd avoid saying things, I'd avoid showing my emotions, I'd purposely show no interest in things that could be seen as 'stereotypical' because it might signify my sexuality to someone else, that would diminish my worth. And that fucking sucks. \n\nBut I see a lot of people saying they didn't relate to Chiron, and I genuinely think - surely this sort of feeling, the pressure to conform to what is expected, effects everyone in some way? We're becoming more and more progressive but there are still ideas that guys should be 'stoic' and emotionless, that women should always be caring and giving and selfless, that certain races are expected to be a certain way or similarly should NEVER be seen to give in to a stereotype. I see Moonlight as a beautiful realist slice of life story, a really heartbreaking and aching romance, but moreover a fascinating look into identity. We're all shaped, in some way, by what society expects us to be and not be, and sometimes that can really fuck us up and tear us apart. \n\nI hope Chiron finds happiness. I hope we all do. ", "I saw this a couple weeks back and so far I think it is my favorite of the year. There is a lot I liked about the movie and some that I wasn't crazy about. Above all else the acting was so great in it. Juan, who was not in the movie all that much, had so much presence and weight on the film that well past when you last see him you still feel his importance. \n\nAll of the actors who played Chiron were amazing. The one that stood out the most to me though was in the middle act. You could feel the shyness and crippling lack of confidence in every scene and it just made each following scene that he runs into yet another problem absolutely brutal. Then the breaking point where he is storming through the school was just fantastic.\n", "Saw Fences. It was good but I enjoyed moonlight much more. Moonlight was much more subtle and \"grounded.\" Moonlight allows the viewer to fill the void with thought and introspection. Fences will dense with dialogue that left little room for the mind to wander the space. \n\nFences held onto a lot of its theatrical roots. That's well and good for some but I prefer visual story telling. \n\nIn summary, there were better performances in Fences, but Moonlight was a better overall movie. \n\n", "What do you think the meaning of the title \"Moonlight\" and Juan's eponymous quote?\n", "I made a tribute video to Moonlight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOVFyK2ZrR0", "I just finished watching this movie and really liked, all the three acts and everything was fantastic.

That laugh though, sinister as hell and awesome!\n\nThis movie gets a 10/10. I wish I had seen it in better quality though. The cinematography seem to be awesome.", "[deleted]", "I think the reactions to Moonlight have a parallel to Boyhood.\n\nWhen I watched Boyhood, I was moved to tears near the end, something that never happens for me in movies. The feeling was unexpected and hard to describe. Only after the movie was I able to deconstruct it's power. Meanwhile, a number of people I talked to who appreciated film sort of thought the movie was a pretty good, well-acted movie with charm, but without the resonance.\n\nWith Moonlight, I thought it was a great piece constructed with love and well acted performances, but I'm not having that powerful, from-the-heart swelling of emotion that I got with Boyhood.\n\nI think the reason is because I am a late 20s male raised in middle class suburbia, and while every aspect isn't parallel (I'm not white or American), the core experiences of the boy in Boyhood resonated in a very deep place for me. I didn't even realize how closely I was drawn into the characters. It was effortless for me despite the lack of a typically compelling narrative arc or dramatic scenes.\n\nIf you grew up poor, black, gay, or a combination of those things, I'd imagine this film taps into a wellspring of emotion in the same way that Boyhood did for me. In that respect, it's a landmark achievement. This is the unique nature of such personal films. I almost wish I had the ability to empathize more with the characters from an emotional rather than intellectual perspective.", "After watching Arrival once I thought that bopped this out for my movie of the year, but I after rewatching Arrival I gotta give it back to Moonlight.

I personally did not enjoy the movie. I thought it was a decent movie nothing great or extremely special but let me explain to you why it deserves the win.            \n\n           Although the movie does make connections to the gay/trans community, it also makes a nod at the hardships children face in a broken home the analysis of the movie at that level is extremely superficial. What the movie is really about is the loss of innocence in a child and that all humans want the same thing. They want to be loved. \n           That scene where they are on the beach was one of the few times Chiron felt like he was loved. The next scene where that same guy beats him up slaps that one bit of happiness right out of his hand. \n              The same is true of his mother. Mothers are supposed to love there children and be there for them but Paula was so busy with her own problems that she neglected him and he didn't get any love from her either. They only place he truly felt like he had some love was with Juan and this is also why he ended up becoming  a drug dealer like Juan is cause that is what he saw. \n           Notice how even though the movie takes place in a primarily urban setting with mostly African American characters yet the score doesn't have a single hip-hop or rap song on it. Instead Barry Jenkins goes with classical music. Ask yourself why he does this. It's because classical music identifies with the human condition better then any other type of music with lyrics would've done. Humans from any caste or creed or gender or ethnicity we are all looking for the same thing and that is to be loved. That is what moonlight is about and it does a excellent job of portraying that concept.  ", "Anyone understand the end of moonlight?  Do the two guys have sex?

And on top of that, that if she is, he must kill her.\n\nThere was no need for him to be aware of the blue dye test to prove she was a spy, and even telling him of the test in the first place was beyond foolish and would compromise the test itself. He could have taken down fake information from the call or just not written anything at all to protect his wife. They couldn't just monitor the transcripts and set up an \"accident\" or \"disappearance\" if it was verified?\n\nAlso, British counterintelligence was extremely proficient and was arguably one of the main reasons that the Allies won the European theater.

But I truly enjoyed this one. It was so gripping. I did want more action, but the tense scenes were really riveting. I really didn't know if she was a traitor or not for the longest time. Really, up until Max found out. I thought the pacing was rushed, I really wanted more from a lot of the scenes.

Zemeckis direction is great. The historical accuracy felt adequate for the story. \n\nMy only complaint about the movie is I wish I didn't see the trailer. It was hard to really appreciate and be immersed in the first act because you already know what's going to happen. The movie began once Max comes home from his briefing from V-section. Which is a shame because the first act was excellent movie making. Marianne's excuse for never telling Max is a little underwhelming. I mean she could have told him she approached by Nazi agents. There was also a not too subtle sign of doubt when Marianne doesn't really kill anyone in the Ambassador's ball until she had to defend herself from her friend that tried to shoot her. \n\nThe only other comment I have to make is that Marion Cotillard is slowly becoming a walking spoiler like Sean Bean. *Inception*, *Dark Knight Rises*, *Macbeth*, and now *Allied* she has played a female character who inevitably betrays the protagonist then kills herself. She should be in a movie with Sean Bean at this point and see who dies first.

I honestly enjoyed it, but i've got one of the AMC loyalty cards, so Tuesday has cheaper tickets, so I believe I got my money's worth.  Might have been more iffy about it if I had paid peak pricing.  \n\nGeneral observation- I wonder how long it'll remain in theaters. The theater I was in was crowded, but it was also one of the smaller auditoriums in the building, which I thought was surprising after realizing it was the night before wide-release.  Not a lot of mention or build up to it.\n\nThis in my opinion is one of the worst offenders I've seen in recent memory, of a trailer having everything in it. Not even like a comedy where you are expecting all of the good jokes, but like pretty much every major scene/plot point is hashed out in the trailer, linearly and chronologically.\n\nI enjoyed Pitt and Cotillard's acting in it.  It seemed genuine and not at all forced, even if some of the plot was hamfisted.  The supporting characters were interesting, if not memorable.  The head of the embassy was stern enough to be a head nazi with a random \"HH\" seemingly tossed in to remind us that he was indeed a nazi-and I feel like the poker/proving the phosphorus mining was set up and went nowhere.  The junior pilot was introduced just enough to make me briefly feel guilty along with Pitt when we learn he was killed.  The superior officer seemed very commanding officerish.  The neighbor that turns out to be a spy, seemed like I should have guessed it in hindsight, along with the jeweler.  The sister and the girlfriend seemed out of place in my opinion.  Granted as a straight dude, in 2016, I am in no way equipped to comment on what lesbian relationships were like in London during WW2, but the characters seemed over the top, at least to be as open as they were to be related to a high ranking military officer.  Not that I have anything against it, but from what little I understand of the time, it's not quite period.\n\nAs far as plot goes, it went back and forth, and did keep me guessing as to whether or not Cotillard's character was actually a German spy. From the trailer I was expecting more action than we got, but i'm not necessarily mad that we didn't.  The set up was done nicely, and I enjoyed the few bits of action that we got.  The plot was pretty straightforward.  There were some points that I kind of wished were further explored.  The idea of it all being an elaborate test to set up Pitt to be a resistance leader prior to D-Day was something that I personally didn't feel was explored enough.  I would have enjoyed it if that is the way the movie ended.  The way it did end seemed sort of contrived to me.  Which to be fair, it did seem to go 50-50.  He did know that his wife was a spy, good.  He shot and killed the network of coconspirators-in the middle.  He tried to aid and abet her and escape to a neutral country-bad.  And then after he almost made it off the ground, with a traitor in tow, the office was just kinda like \"whelp glad we got it all sorted out\" which wasn't necessarily out of character in my opinion, but then again his character isn't really explored enough to know if it was in or out of character.\n\nAs far as visually, I would not call this movie an artistic masterpiece, but I did enjoy several of the shots and the way it looked.  In my opinion it walked the tightrope well of not being overly graphic (with sex and violence) but at the same time didn't necessarily shy away from it either.  The car in the sandstorm, Pitt finishing off the soldiers and then the cut away to Cotillard yanking the curtains in the same tempo, the glitz of the parties, the tracers of the AA fire across the night sky I all enjoyed visually.  \n\nPacing, my theater seemed to be pretty tense at times, and there were some edge of the seat moments, despite being fairly predictable at times.\n\nAll in all, it was solid.  Not good, not bad.  I'd recommend it to someone with time and money to spare, but not call it a must see.  It definitely pales in comparison to Hacksaw Ridge and Fury (throwing it out there because it's another Brad Pitt WW2 Movie).  If you are debating between this movie and another movie I would probably recommend the other movie, but that might be overly harsh.  It's bad that part of the notable parts was the trailer for Scorsese's Silence and Mark W. as a cop in the Boston Bombing movie.  Another poster said it well with \"Eh\".  Not outstanding, not horrible, pretty middle of the road in my opinion.  Might have different opinions after a subsequent viewing, but that's it for this random stream of consciousness.\n\nTL;DR: Worth the price of admission, but not the accompanying popcorn and drink.", "Does anyone know why Brad Pitt had to write the chemical equation to be invited to the party near the beggining?", "Beautifull film only thing I would have wished is that some scenes were longer.

Really...I'm merely a student that took French in highschool and is continuing in college, but even I could tell the major flaws in his accent. This isn't meant as a swing at Brad Pitt (Max himself says he's from Ontario, not Quebec), but lets be honest, if even I can tell, actual French speakers, yes including French Moroccans, should also be able to tell he wasn't really Parisian (or even a native French speaker for that matter). Even if they couldn't immediately catch on, all they had to do was hear the obvious difference between Marianne's accent and Max's.

Lizzy Caplan was completely irrevelant to the film, even though I love me some Lizzy Caplan. The film is 124 minutes so they had more time, but with the way it was written it just didn't have the narrative to pull it all together. I thought the scenes in Morocco were excellently written, acted well, and had very good cinematography. It all got a bit dull in Britain, only the basement scene and party stick out. The scene in France was great. I don't know what I would really focus on to make the narrative better, but I guess it has to Marianne, with an actress like Cotillard, she can never get too much screen time.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it, and thought it was good, but at the same time had a tinge of disappointment because I felt it could have been better.", "When Marianne is all alone with the baby and sings a lullaby in French I thought that was a sure sign she wasn't a spy, but.......alas", "I didn't expect to see this movie at all... but Fantastic Beasts and Arrival were sold out :). Anyways, amazing movie that never kept me bored. The beginning where Cotillard's character talks of how empty her life as a spy basically is really made me question whether she could have empathy towards Max. At the end, Zemeckis left a bunch of subtle hints to her actually not caring for him with Max leaving the gun in the car and her looking back repeatedly, obviously not wanting to be caught. It was just so tense and I genuinely had no clue what would happen. I thought it was evident from the trailer that she was a spy, but really didn't think it would be this emotional or psychological. Great acting as well, especially at the end with Pitt as he comprehends what just happened. Anyways, great movie that I highly recommend. ", "Saw it yesterday.

I'm no movie snob - more one of those immature Sharknado-loving cringe humour types, to be honest. This film is shit. Maybe if you really hate black midgets and like mums joking unfunnily about their son liking anal sex over and over and over again it's for you. Kathy Bates was suicide-inducing. Women don't exist except for bad santa to want to or achieve having sex with, with calamitously unfunny results. 'Fuck mama!' 'Don't say mama'. Hilarious. Thurman is really fat and autistic, which apparently takes away any sort of logic yet he got across the entire United States just fine. Nobody wants him, or the black midget, because they're autistic or black or small ('negro land of oz'). Great. It was offensive but I'm a white male I'm sure if anyone could I could look past it if it was funny but fuck me was it not. Genuinely awful. Depressing. \n\nIt's not even so bad it's funny, not cringe-inducing, nothing. I went in happy and came out morose. So so so bad. Ming numbing. As I mentioned, I'm no snob but I found myself judging anybody who enjoyed it. It was a film equivalent of a 12 year old saying swear words in an attempt to be edgy but without any modicum of the 'well you can laugh at them' you might imagine. I laughed more at the end of Marley & Me and I've never even seen that film. Not good. \n\nEDIT: The worst point of the whole film is that we see a lot of flesh, especially from Jenny Zugrino, and none of it is Christina Hendricks. Why? I don't mean to be a pig but if you're going for that market then it'd be the only logical step. Baffling. ", "As a fan of the first film, this was heartbreaking. It's just as crass and misanthropic as the first film but it has absolutely none of its genuine wit or edge, nor does it have the twisted yet organic heart. As a film in general, it's a piece of shit. This film is poorly directed, shot, and edited, like a CBS sitcom or a Tyler Perry film. The script is atrocious, just crass for the sake of being crass. And worst of all, it's boring. Billy Bob Thornton looks like he doesn't even want to be there, Christina Hendricks is wasted in such a horrible role, Thurman is now creepy instead of endearing, Tony Cox is also wasted, Kathy Bates' character could've worked if the script was better but she doesn't work because the script is terrible, and the film even tries to have its rancid cake and eat it too with its stabs at sentimentality and unearned redemption. This film was written by five people (Johnny Rosenthal, John M. Phillips, Steve Pink, Doug Ellin & Shauna Cross) over the course of seven years (three of these writers (Phillips, Pink & Ellin) went uncredited, but Ellin still decided to have an executive producer credit), and it shows. One of those writers (Phillips) previously wrote Dirty Grandpa, another awful comedy that's crass for the sake of being crass and tries to have its rancid cake and eat it too with its stabs at cheap sentimentality, and it really shows. Terry Zwigoff, Glenn Ficarra, John Requa, and the Coen brothers weren't involved, and it REALLY, REALLY shows. Fuck this movie.

I'm personally hoping Lin Manuel sticks around for something just a little more focused with Disney, but really seems Disney's on fire either way.", "I may be a bit bias, but feel compelled to share this with you all when I say this was an incredible movie to me and particularly emotional one too. As a Samoan/Hawaiian, there are principles and values that are central to our Pacific Culture that for many years I've tried to share with anyone I meet. This story really brought many of those values out to the larger screen, to a larger audience, and I didn't realize seeing it this way would affect me so.  When baby Moana first stepped onto that beach in the early part of the movie... \"the feels\" are an understatement.  We were crying openly as if seeing a reflection of our own childhood on a beach in Samoa and in Hawaii -- the happiness, the curiosity, the sea.\n\nThe story of the Polynesians voyaging across the Pacific; the sense of ohana and family; how important coconuts are to island life; how the island provides all you need; sense of duty to go out and seek solutions and bring them home; chickens and pigs all over the place (!); the beautiful and varied languages; the dancing; the art and craft of the tapestries (tapa/capa cloth) and other designs; the canoe designs; the laughing; the relationship with the ocean.... these are all real things we as Pacific Islanders feel in a beautiful, unique life. \n\nThis was a well done movie. Disney deserves credit for bringing so much joy and pride to a people that are often associated with tikis and grass skirts... We are so much more, and the story told herein gives a taste. \n\n4/4 stars. 10/10.  Thumbs.  Fresh tomatoes.  Etc :-)", "I love the music. I'm a huge Hamilton nerd and you can hear Lin-Manuel Miranda's influences in more places than just the rap verse in You're Welcome.", "For the first time in a long time for me, I wanted MORE songs in the movie. Not sure if it's Lin or my love of Hawaiian/Polynesian music. As opposed to most others (I imagine) \"You're Welcome\" was my least favorite song. ", "I felt like Moana was a great example of how to portray a feminist character.  In the movie, her gender is NOT made a big deal.  She's not a hero, IN SPITE of her gender, she's just a hero.  It's never once doubted that she's confident, capable, and a leader.  I felt like it would have been really easy for Disney to have made a plot along the lines of \"I should be the next chief, but I'm a girl so people doubt me.\" Instead they focused on Moana's conflicting desires with those of her people, which is a much more interesting conflict.  Very well done overall.", "So this movie kind of accidentally pairs up with Kubo and the Two Strings. It hits a lot of the same beats, eye instead of heart, giant weapon covered skeleton instead of giant glitter covered crab.\n\nMusic was superb and I loved the subtle deconstruction/parody of the usual Disney formula.\n\nMy favorite moment of the entire movie was Moana grabbing provisions and her mother spotting her, tearing up and helping. 6 seconds of film carried so much power and emotion.", "The movie was great but what I'm so happy with is the fact it had no love interest what so ever.

", "My personal verdict: A solid 8.5/10. What a great movie.\n\n\n**The Good:**\n\n\n- The Pacific and Polynesian theme/style direction. My god does the film look gorgeous and a majority of the soundtrack sounds so beautiful. The islands of the Pacific and the ocean as a whole is a backdrop that I feel is just *perfect* for animated movies due to its color and vibrance, but not a lot of animated movies have taken advantage of that. There is Moana, then Lilo and Stitch, Finding Nemo/Dory (Kind of), and both Spongebob Squarepants movies (Kind of). The rich vibrant colors of the green islands contrasting with the wide expansive blue is just so impressive to look at. Same goes for the music, which a lot of it was styled after a very Polynesian theme. Lots of uses of the beautiful chanting chorus as well as the heavy beats of drums combined with the pretty scenery just makes for a great movie.\n\n\n- Moana herself. She has become one of my favorite Disney Princesses...if you can call her a Princess that is. I suspect Disney marketing will count her as such and I will too. She is the next up in a long line of strong independent Princess leads that has started to crop up, but personally to me I feel Moana is the strongest out of all of them. The way they handled her character (As well as poke fun and subvert the princess tropes of yore) has really escalated herself up into the ranks as some of the best.\n\n\n- The [*\"We Know the Way\"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOwVQvAIK-k) song sequence. Oh my god, this part gave me so many chills down my spine. So many chills. To those who need remembering, the sequence is when Moana hits the drum and learns about her people's past through the musical montage of her ancestors sailing the high seas in search of new lands. That whole montage is so fucking beautiful to look at, and the music that accompanies it just makes it feel so much more awesome. The chanting, the drum beats, it is such a great musical montage sequence and has become my favorite part of the movie as a whole.\n\n\n- Fridge Brilliance (Spoilers): The fact that Te Ka and Te Fiti are both the same goddess. At first I thought it was a rather cheapish cop out when Moana saw the spiral in Te Ka's chest went ahead to place the stone in it. It didn't click in my head until I saw Te Fiti's hand sprout green plants into the ground and I saw the brilliant reason as to why that was; in the Pacific Islands, volcanoes bring both life and death. Where a volcano erupts and the lava flow runs across the land, it destroys everything in its path. But when the flow hardens, it leaves behind nutrient rich soil and soon enough plant and animal life begins to prosper where the destruction once was. I thought that was utterly brilliant.\n\n\n**The Bad**\n\n\n- Jemaine Clement's *\"Shiny\"* song. Sorry to those who rather enjoyed the segment, but that was a low point for me. I felt like it was just unnecessary. Why? It felt *really* out of place to me. In a beautiful soundtrack that was very much inspired by the rhythm and soul of Polynesian culture comes this really weird soft rockish type of song with disco ball-esque lighting and it's just really weird. It honestly felt like a knock off of Genie's song from Aladdin where it takes a musical stylistic approach that is vastly different from the other songs of the movie as well as be a means to be very comedic as well. What I *wish* would have happened is if Tamatoa was a cocky but distinguished crab god, with his song being in a style similar to the [Hawaiian War Chant](https://youtu.be/hQqdeOcd-Zo?t=757) from Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room where he sings and brags all about the treasures he has collected over the years and relates his tales of being awesome while collecting them. It would have given his song a lot of power with booming drums and chanting and actually make him feel *like* the 50 foot crab god he is and not just some throwaway villain.\n\n\n- The pacing. Overall the movie has a great story, but there were moments where I felt the movie would cut too quickly (The first battle with Te Ka) or drag on forever (The *\"Shiny*\" song) where some moments came and went so quick there wasn't really any time to relish upon them and some moments that would linger of for so long that they felt like they overstayed their welcome. The entire movie wasn't like this, but there were definitively moments of that here and there.\n\n\nOverall, Moana is definitively a fantastic movie that people should go out to see. It has its problems but I still feel it is a really strong product and a great great great addition to the Disney film lineup.\n\n\nSide note: For those who got it, did anyone find the trailer for Hidden Figures a really odd choice of trailer for this movie? It's wedged in between the new Smurfs movie trailer and the LEGO Batman trailer. You honestly couldn't get a weirder trailer if you could. A better choice honestly would have been the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailer in its place. Not only would it promote more Disney material, but its light and peppy tone would better suit the other trailers instead of a biographical film about three African-American women working at NASA for the Apollo Missions.\n\n\n**EDIT:** I actually wonder how well Moana would have done if it was released in the 1960's when the popularity of Polynesian Culture was at its peak in the United States. I am just assuming it would have been a massive hit and been cemented as a Disney classic. Just a pure shower thought there...", "> Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome\n\n>'Cause I'm gonna need that boat\n\n>I'm sailing away, away\n\n>You're welcome!\n\n>'Cause Maui can do anything but float\n\n\nBiggest laugh in the movie for me.

Did not expect that. Usually popcorn movies tell you or cue you in when you're supposed to feel a certain thing, but this movie had moments that just made me well up spontaneously. \n\nI thought the first act was the best, followed by the third. The middle could have been better.", "I hate to sound a little perverted here but did anyone notice how Moana's body differed from other Disney female leads? Her arms and legs seemed to be a little thicker than the usual Disney princesses and thought that may have been to make her a little stronger looking since she's dealing with circumstances such as climbing a mountain and fighting coconut pirates. If that is the reason I really appreciated that small change.", "One of the little things I absolutely loved about this movie was that there were no bad guys. Absolutely none. The only evil that was in the movie was greed and bitterness personified as Tamatoa and [Tefiti](#spoiler). Sure, Moana's parents are against her sailing but they aren't backwards or wrong. The song \"Where You Are\" had a great message about finding happiness in the present. They weren't wrong in the same way that Maui wasn't wrong. He did what he did to help humanity. In addition, Maui's mistake would only have made him a bad guy if he didn't correct it. That sends a great message that mistakes are only bad if you don't make good. For a thousand years, Maui didn't correct his and his legacy was ruined. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the music (minus \"Shiny\", let's just ignore that one). The animation itself was drop dead gorgeous. The cast was fantastic and I loved that they had the cast sing their own songs rather than having a weird Judy Kuhn situation. The representation of Polynesian culture and practice was awesome and really made a lot of people feel empowered. The messages of self-acceptance, finding beauty in the present, following your heart, and make mistakes to learn were excellent choices by the writers. Really happy with the end result. Would like the watch it again.", "Damn, I didn't think anyone was in such agreement about the crab scene being awful. I'm not a huge Disney fan but that scene was one of my favorite. The song is weird at first but it quickly became really funny to me for some reason. It reveals a part of Maui's past, the glow in the dark visuals are cool and it reinforces the whole greed thing.

To which they'd basically reiterate Moana's argument from before, and this is what makes him realize she deserves his help. \n\nI know they wanted his return to be a surprise for the audience, but frankly, anyone with a basic understanding of storytelling knows he'd come back, so it's already a predictable plot moment. They could have at least subverted that, by having Maui's change of heart be an opportunity for more excellent drama. \n\nAs it is, it feels like there's an entire scene missing, and Maui is suddenly completely cool with things after his tantrum earlier? As an aspiring screenwriter, I'd handle that differently. \n\nBut, hey.... otherwise LOVE this movie.

I don't consider that a detriment because it did liven up the old tropes.\n\nMoana wasn't a girl who didn't want the ruling responsibility - because of an ancestral calling within her, she knew that she had to take on another part of Chiefdom responsibility that had been ignored.\n\nI'm surprised at how much of the humor didn't land for me. It's not a detriment, because there's so much heart and love, but Zootopia was funnier.", "This movie had an excellent soundtrack and gorgeous visuals 10/10.

That final \"villain\" moment was beautifully executed and unexpected.

I could make at least 20 different beautiful desktop backgrounds from this film and y'all best know I will.\n\nThe characters were all fantastic and the dynamic between Maui and Moana was great with each event pushing their great arcs just a little further. Their dynamic was not only great in dialogue but also in action as in each conflict they go through both characters work off each other and improve in doing so throughout the film. \n\nThe soundtrack was spectacular,  you know I'll be downloading all of these songs. \n\nOne of the things that sets this film apart from other Disney films is its use of  a female protagonist in that in the many recent Disney films which have been all \"Yeah, look how strong I am,  you wouldn't think that of a woman!\"  and this has felt really shoehammered into the film. This wasn't the case of Moana as the film didn't make a big deal of how bad ass she was,  it just made her bad ass. Moana and her determination was the driving force of the movie and the whole thing felt very natural as opposed to a \"strong female protagonist\"  bouncing around between situations in which they can show those who doubted them how strong they are. \n\nCons:\nThe coconut pirates very much felt like they needed someone to attack the ship and some producer said \"You see those guys who attack the boat. Two words: coconut minions\". The attack itself was very well done but there was little to no reason for the characters actually being coconuts. \n\nWhile I absolutely adore Jermaine Clement and loved the crabs song basically just before it was like a bonus flight of the conchordes song (yes please)  it seriously didn't fit in with the rest of the film.  I loved it but the whole thing was like\n\nMoana-Moana-Moana-Flight of the Conchordes-Moana\n\nNow don't get me wrong,  I bloody loved it,  but dear god did it break the flow. \n\nThat said the pros so heavily outweighed the cons it was an absolutely stunning experience and I know I'll gladly watch it again sometime in the near future.

It could be an animator mistake\nOR\n2. It's Maui and he didn't actually leave when he left Moana on the boat before she sees her grandma, and he really just watched over her from a distance to make sure she stay safe or something like that around that vicinity.\n\n", "This may be my second-favorite Disney movie ever, after Lilo&Stitch. \n\nEvery review, even the negative ones, mentions that it's visually stunning, so let's skip over that part. The songs! I have no idea what anyone hears in the songs in *Frozen*; I thought those were bland and forgettable. I'm not even very fond of musicals, but I liked every song in *Moana* and I could sing *How Far I\u2019ll Go* after hearing it once. The scene where she finds her confidence again made me cry; it was a perfect blend of well-timed songs and plot/action. Also, I generally hate comic-relief sidekicks (the bumbling aliens were the worst part about the aforementioned Lilo&Stitch), but I really liked the chicken.

There's nothing wrong with a more simple story.\n\n- Moana is a great character. It's refreshing to see a different princess design. She's dark skin, black wavy hair, and with thicker body proportions.\n- I never saw a single trailer or promo before tonight. I thought Maui was going to be a doofy sidekick, but he turned out to be the coolest guy.\n- The plot breaks up the pacing with some interesting moments and scenes.\n- The animation is incredible. Disney's hair and water technology has at its best here. Just beautiful. I cannot imagine how long it took to render all of this.\n- I'm really enjoying these new Disney plots that aren't too straightforward. There's no \"rescue the princess and beat the evil bad guy\" here. Just more of a journey.\n- The signature song \"How Far I'll Go\" is fantastic. Not as infectious as \"Let It Go\" but still very catchy.\n- The dumb chicken gag was a little too much for me. So was the cute pig pet. Yeah, I get it, all Disney princesses need them but still.\n\nBy the way, the short in the beginning was too painful.

Auli'i Cravalho has a beautiful voice, and I imagine a lot of young girls will be using \"How Far I'll Go\" as an audition piece. Jemaine Clement was good too. I thought Dwayne Johnson was just OK, but \"You're Welcome\" is really catchy. My favourite, though, is \"We Know the Way.\" It's beautiful. \n\n- I would have liked to see more of the pig.

I was worried when I heard the early drafts were full of stereotypes, but I thought they did a great job and several parts gave me goosbumps for sure. I love that they made Maui comical too and not the great demigod he's often portrayed as. Disney does a good job of sort of respectfully caricaturing big characters like that.

I have to say I think the critics were over-bashing the format in my opinion. It undeniably looks incredibly strange and at times downright awful. Yet there were many shots that felt unbelievable, delivering a kind of depth and clarity I have never seen before. The shot of Billy's head watching the halftime show was just unbelievable, the various level of depth created a perfectly nightmarish beauty that captured the tone of the film very well. That said many shots felt like plays. The depth in particular felt weird. Any interior scene was bizarre, as the walls and floor felt so flat in comparison to the people that it felt like the people felt like holograms even though they were clearly in a real physical space. Also because they needed so much light for the HFR the entire film felt insanely overlit. I left feeling like this wasn't the future of cinema but it is an exciting tool for filmmakers. I hope an arthouse director experiments with it, or someone incorporates HFR shots into films for dramatic or artistic effect. My friend and I agree a film like Holy Mountain, that's bright and surreal, could be incredible in 120fps. Basically I'm saying don't throw out the entire process, there's something interesting here.\n\nAs for the film itself, it's one of Ang Lee's worst I hate to say. All the nuance of the book is stripped away and the novel's flowery language feels unbelievably cheesy. Worst of all it often feels pro-military, even though you know the film is attempting something far more grounded. I will say I was very surprised by Garrett Hedlund, who gave the best performance in the film IMO. Overall it's a pretty forgettable film that divulges in Lee's worst traits.\n\n**tl;dr the tech isn't as bad as I heard, but a whole movie of it doesn't work.

The ultimate message seems to be that everyone, from greedy capitalists to frat assholes to sympathetic sisters, do not understand what war is like. SPC Lynn ultimately goes back to his squad because they're the only ones who truly understand (so cliche). It isn't really clear if SPC Lynn suffers from PTSD or simply is disillusioned. Maybe it's the point, but the movie feels like it doesn't really have a message or even focus. It's somewhat structured like a road movie, where the squad encounters one person after another (albeit constrained inside a stadium).\n\nThe movie is also too smug. I haven't read the novel, but the movie makes too many break-the-4th-wall references like securing funding from China. Maybe I took the film too seriously, but they really felt out of place. The whole theater was laughing throughout, but I didn't find it funny :(.\n\nI must praise the acting. Garrett Hedlund's SSG Dime is awesome!

Stand-out performer.\n", "So is this movie an actual well made movie or is it just a tech demo", "I saw it in 120fps 3D 4k. The only time the fps felt jarring for me was the first 3 seconds of the film as my mind adjusted. The 4k was stunning, everything in the background looked as crisp as the foreground, and my mind would constantly pay attention to movement and detail in the background (I am sure due to 120fps as well). In my opinion, the 3D was very necessary because it layered the subjects in a very smart manner. If I had to watch the entire movie in 4k 120fps and not have the layers, my mind would not focus on anything because there is just so much visual detail on the screen. The movie was extra-bright, but I enjoyed the change since so many 3D movies are a bit on the darker side because of the tinted glasses you have to wear. I would not want every movie filmed this way, but I certainly wouldn't mind more movies experimenting with it. Movie tickets are getting to be astronomically high, so when a movie makes an event of the technology, it makes the theater-going experience significantly more rewarding than just watching a movie at home.\n\nAs for the movie's content, it was alright. The acting was good: Vin Diesel gave a surprisingly strong performance and was the perfect choice for making his character sympathetic through only a few minutes of screentime. Garret Hedlund was great. The 120fps forced the crew to not fake as much throughout the process, and I really appreciated the lack of makeup on the actors. It did feel more like reality. A lot of the dialogue, especially in the latter third, was very in-your-face with the thesis of the movie and had no subtlety. The last minute of the movie redeemed it though.\n\nThe movie did have an impact on me. There were a lot of humorous moments but equally as many serious ones. There were the war motifs throughout that others have commented on, and I agree that it is mainly mediocre when viewed through that lens. However, I saw it as a more general indictment on American commercialization and entertainment. The world in Iraq was so real and brutal, but in America everything was so manufactured and hollow for no real reason. Everyone was treating the football **game** so seriously and the halftime show was preceded by a character saying \"Let's go to war,\" but it all exists for entertainment purposes only. There is no \"real\" war to the stadium or \"real\" anything. Everything is a movie deal/a negotiation. Even the heroes weren't real to the people, they stood on a stage just a minute too long and suddenly there was a 'war' between them and the crew. There's a lot of other moments in the movie that go into other themes or add on, but I have gone on long enough. \n\n**tl;dr the technology was engrossing and the filmmaking aspects were all great.

However in battle, the format sang, and it also added a ton of tension as Billy nervously patrolled the bazaar. 3D has also never looked better. Not as the overall future of cinema, but I think there is a future for exhibition in this format.\n\nNow the movie. Really thought the script let down the concept in an extreme way. Extremely clunky dialogue that felt the need to state every thesis the movie had.

I'm not a big movie guy so I've never heard of Hailee Steinfeld before this, but her performance was outstanding. I've never actually related with a character on a level like that.

Although mine is a little different, my best friend started dating my ex and I haven't talked to either in almost two years because of it.\n\nBut most of all the visual of her kind of losing her mind and being an asshole to a lot of people who cared about her. The feeling that the whole world is out to get you is real in my life, the idea nobody actually cares about you is real for me. Then the parts where she was contemplating texting Nick, how she had this idea of what she wanted and constantly freaked out and almost sent stupid shit to him. Then when it finally happened she wasn't ready and realized it wasn't for her. And her freaking out and leaving fifth period to avoid everyone and everything because it felt like the biggest deal in the world but you couldn't truly escape it. Finally, the social awkwardness at the party and then the part at the end where she meets new people through Erwin and all that. \n\nSorry if this was long winded or ranty but the bottom line is the character of Nadine was spectacular and I'm glad I could relate to her even though.

And her brother never said sorry, or felt remorse for the whole hooking up thing. Neither does the friend really.\n\nI guess that's supposed to make it more real? I just like having \"justice\" of sorts, and while Nadine made some really stupid choices, her \"friend\" really didn't seem to care about leaving her behind.

Nice coming of age flick, and I am positive this can be one of the better ones in that genre at least in recent times. Really really impressed by Hailee Steinfeld here.

Decent supporting roles too, although not all of them were fleshed out well.\n\nReally Really loved Woody Harrelson here, but felt sometimes his comedic role became way too asshole-y just for the sake of it. I liked the point of his character, showed Nadine that her problems weren't exceptional but I felt like it could have been done better.", "Oh man was this refreshing. Funny, smart, heartwarming, genuine.  Subverts the coming of age tropes not just for the sake of subversion, but just to tell an honest story.  Oh yeah and Steinfeld is a goddamn star.", "I just got back from a screening and I particularly enjoyed the film. Good enough where I felt good giving my money to a small budget production (9 million) like this. Two things that bothered me was that they're trying to portray this character as someone who is unlovable, unattractive and Hailee Steinfield is definitely not those traits naturally. Sure, they made her hair frizzy, stripped her makeup and made her wear clothes one size too big, but once she dressed up and dolled up (which looked great btw) for Nick, you say \"she clearly has the resources, like the flat iron, makeup, clothes in her closet) so why doesn't she put a little effort in and perhaps she wouldn't be treated AS BAD.\n\n Also, Erwin showed Nadine his drawings and he completely disappears until the end of the film. You'd think that after that she gets used and stands by the dumpster crying, she would call Erwin but the teacher is a reasonable outlet too.\n\nSome moments definitely hit the feels. Especially that disappointing line from mom, and also when Nick mentions that she's a booty call and has no other incentive of knowing Nadine. I was sorta sad and angry at the same time because that's when she realizes that NO ONE likes her or treats her with respect. You just want to reach past the screen to console her. However, you call her an idiot at the same time because she was literally asking for it at the same time... \n\nWould watch again 8/10", "Turns out this movie got crazy good reviews, I'm definitely seeing it now.", "Honestly though it was a good movie.

Cast blended perfectly, writing was sharp and authentic. Loved the awkward but hilarious chemistry between Hailee Steinfeld and Hayden Szeto.

I got excited with every easter egg of JKR's, though I do think there were too many blatant sequel hooks. We don't know who Leta Lestrange is (not thrilled about Zoe Kravtiz; she's the worst part of every movie she's in), anyone who didn't read the books would be confused about the Scooby Doo-esque Grindelwald reveal, we know Credence is coming back and we know Newt is shadier than he seems (they mentioned a brother of his who was in the war, I believe). \n\nBut I'm glad I fell in love with this team as fast as I fell in love with the trio. I find Newt to be a really unique main character because of how misanthropic he is. He doesn't like people but he's self-aware of how he comes across (\"I annoy people\") and doesn't bother to change his behavior. He's aware of the laws but he clearly does not care about breaking them. Queenie was the flattest for me as I feel they could've done more about her legilimens ability but again, I know JKR is saving more for the next movies.\n\nJacob was an absolute delight and I loved him, as did everyone else. His scenes at the end were brilliant though it's strange to end the movie on a supporting character. I'm guessing Warner Bros decided not to make that an after-credits scene because it felt like one. I wanted more bonding scenes between the four. The chemistry between Newt and Jacob was really good. By the end you really feel Newt's remorse at having to let Jacob go.\n\nColin Farrell was really good. The Johnny Depp reveal surprised the hell out of me even though I knew he'd been cast.\n\nThought the CGI was good enough and that the beasts were creative. I really hope they recreate the inside of Newt's suitcase in the Harry Potter theme park. I thought JKR could've found a better way to weave in Newt's story with the general plotline, though, since him catching his beasts again felt more like a sidequest since we knew what was at stake.\n\nI agree with some pacing issues but other than that for JKR's first screenplay this was done really well, and the Harry Potter vibe was present all throughout. I was skeptical about 5 movies, but now I'm happy to be supporting this franchise.\n\nP.S. \"Shall we die just a little?\" What does this meaaaaaan.

He's a good actor and can do a lot more than Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow. \n\nOverall I liked the movie. For an original plot it was fairly solid. I really enjoyed the depiction of the American wizarding community as being rather intolerant and McCarthy-esque. I liked the 'outcast' motif with so many of the characters and Newt's willingness to help Credence made perfect sense when you consider that he is an outcast himself and spends his time with creatures that many wizards apparently want exterminated. The action sequences were more well-thought out than people casting spells in a hallway which is often what you got in the other movies. They put a lot of effort into the creatures and it really shows.\n\nBut there were a few plot points that bothered me:\n\n1) It seems beyond belief that two wizards could be sentenced to death by a lone investigator and have their sentence carried out immediately. That was an extremely jarring plot element (the method of execution was pretty imaginative though).\n\n2) I know you can't have wizards fighting in the streets of NYC without a deus-ex machina to make everyone forget, but that doesn't make it much easier to swallow.\n\n3) So Credence dies and... everyone forgets him and hugs and says goodbye? They should have had the characters talk about him more during the conclusion.\n\nFinally, Grindelwald's reveal wasn't handled well, it almost felt like a Scooby-Doo moment. Voldemort was honestly a very shallow character in the HP books, even with his backstory, but he was sinister because of his reveal. He's a legend in the first book/movie and only appears briefly and partially. In the second one you're dealing with his memory, in the third his lackey, until finally he makes a grand appearance in the fourth.\n\nUltimately, I am not sad to see this become a franchise.

I really, really enjoyed the film, especially after I let some of that cynicism go and just let the film take me in.\n\n**The Good**\n\n- Eddie Redmayne does a great job as Newt Scamander, and Newt is a pretty enjoyable hero. He's a different kind of hero than we typically get in large blockbuster movies- he's essentially a socially awkward but ingenious scientist, not a badass- and I found that oddly refreshing.\n- The film touches on some serious themes, and I liked being exposed to some of the seedier, darker elements of the wizarding world we haven't seen much of before. The whole \"wizarding death penalty\" scene was kind of shocking and suitably disturbing.\n- The setting feels very magical, which is nice, as the later *Potter* films were accused of sucking some of the magic out of the setting. Magic is positively omnipresent in the film whenever the characters are in the wizarding world.\n- I really liked the designs of the creatures. They didn't look ridiculous while still looking, well, fantastic.\n- There were several scenes that gave me feels, especially when Jacob has to have his memory wiped.\n\n**The Meh**\n\n- The performances besides Redmayne. Certainly not bad, but just serviceable.\n- The special effects. In some areas they're great, in others, the CGI was *very* noticeable.\n- The scenes of Newt recapturing his creatures, while fun and well done, felt pretty extraneous to the main plot.\n\n**The Bad**\n\n- The beginning and end are easily the worst parts of the film. The beginning is one big exposition dump, and the end has \"*Return of the King* syndrome\", it simply goes on too long after the climax, and there are several scenes where you think it's about to end and then it doesn't.\n- Why are the goblins CG now? They were done with makeup in the previous films, but now they're bad CGI. Why? A nitpick, I know, but really.\n- The soundtrack. It's not *bad*, really, but after Desplat, Williams, and Doyle's brilliant scores in the original *Potter* series, it's disappointingly forgettable in comparison.\n\n**Overall**, I thought the film was great.

I liked it, of course, but have one major reservation about it. MAJOR SPOILERS\n\nThe film is basically three stories that come together at the end.\n\n1. Newt, Tina, Jacob, Queenie trying to catch escaped beasts.\n\n2. Anti-witch family preaching their cause\n\n3. Percival Graves trying to catch the obscurial terrorizing New York.\n\nThe cross-cutting between Newt, the anti-witch folk, and the Graves takes a while to pay off. I enjoyed hanging out with Newt and Jacob, but I didn't like as much when we had to turn back to the others. This was a minor problem with the movie, and I anticipate where the series is going as well:\n\nEventually, Graves is revealed to be Grindelwald, infamous dark wizard. In the end, the film wasn't really about Newt Scamandar catching and cataloging wild magical beasts in his famous book. It was about battling a major dark wizard. A few beasts happened to escape and cause a minor ruckus, but it's sort of inconsequential in the end in comparison to Grindelwald trying to catch an obscurial.\n\nIt also became clear that Ariana Dumbledore was an obscurus, which explains why Grindelwald would know about them, and be chasing one.\n\nI think it becomes pretty clear at the end of *Beasts* that Rowling's primary goal in this series is to build up Grindelwald, and ultimately end with Dumbledore and Grindelwald\u2019s enormous, famous battle. The film ends on a big tease of Grindelwald saying he won't be held. We know Depp is a major character in the second film. We know the juicy history between Albus Dumbledore and Grindelwald. We know how it ends.\n\nBut why then do we have to see that all through Newt\u2019s eyes? It feels like Newt\u2019s narrative about these beasts is tangential to the primary purpose. Rowling is trying to make both narratives work at the same time.\n\nProducer David Heyman basically confirmed (http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1586630/fantastic-beasts-ending-a-key-scene-that-was-cut-and-why) that Newt and company aren't quite as important to the forthcoming narrative as young Dumbledore and Grindelwald.\n\nObviously, I'm projecting where the series is going without much evidence. But, it was difficult enough to make Newt and company involved with the capture of a major dark wizard in this first film. It involved a lot of coincidence, and right place at the right time. If that keeps happening over and over, and Rowling keeps trying to shoehorn Newt and Tina into history where they don't exactly belong.... the films could suffer.\n\nTell me I'm wrong about my worry.\n\nTL;DR: I think Rowling is more concerned in the *Fantastic Beasts* film series with exploring Grindelwald and Dumbledore's backstory, than she is in exploring Newt and magical creatures. The films could become annoying if Rowling keeps trying to shoehorn Newt and Tina into the Grindelwald storyline.", "I really enjoyed the movie. The wizarding world is so interesting and wonderful, and I loved how much it was expanded on in this film!", "On the Grindelwald reveal, I'm willing to cut depp some slack. His speech as Graves near the end was all him, and I think the whole part of Graves that everyone likes with him being convincing and smooth is all part of gellerts character.\n\nYou get a sense of his arrogance when he claims they can't hold him. But I saw nothing that made him this crazy over the top maniac people are saying. While I'm sad Graves wasn't just a racialzed follower that might have struck too close to home in the current world. I'm willing to give him a chance. We hardly saw anything of him and I look forward to seeing him in his stride in future instalments", "Wow they really kept Johnny Depp well hidden. Anyway, I enjoyed it a great deal! Jacob and Queenie especially. Wish they delved a little more into the world though. Overall, amazing movie.", "I didn't like this movie very much... I thought the character development was super weak, the plot was inconsistent and it reeked of cliches.\n\nIt's biggest flaw is never going deep into anything; none of the bonds between the characters are explored. They never build upon credence's character. He's presented to us a kid with deep rooted issues powerful enough to bring forth those crazy powers, and he dies a chump's death as soon as the story demanded it. Another big flaw this movie had was that all the danger that is presented to us is superficial. In the end, the obscuris was bukkakke'd out of existence in a few seconds as soon as the US magic ministry peeps showed up. And then, after a shitty unimaginative magic duel, Grindelwald is donezo. No stakes were raised, the magic popo steps in amd everything is magically resolved. And then the only remaining issue, which is the ecposure of magic, is solved with the worst of ass pulls, and suddenly everything was Hunky Dory. \n\nIn the end, the main character started out as and ended up as the same shy, quirky mysterious dude, the only difference being we now know he had a past. Oooooh! Deep  right? The chubby comic relief sidekick didn't do jack squat to the plot and was only there to make the story more relatable as a muggle experiencing the magical stuff for the first time. He helped Newt feed his animals, he held the briefcase for a few minutes, and in the end he ends up with his dream bakery and (we can assume) his dream girl, who BY THE WAY is only attached to him because they share a love for baking, and because he happened to be there when we were introduced to Queenie. Fucking yawn.\n\nBasically  this movie killed any chance it had to go in depth with elements of the harry potter universe. Instead we got a hodge podge of underdevelopped ideas. The Harry Potter films did these things well, since we were following the story of kids discovering magic, it filled us with awe as the story was told to us through a sort of filter of childish innocence. In this movie  they did EXACTLY the same, but with a muggle instead of children. I personally am tired of being \"shown\" magical stuff without it meaning anything. There are so many elements of the Harry Potter universe that are not touched upon enough like wizard muggle relations (these are only ever briefly touched upon), the lives of wizards outside of ministries or schools (surely some wizards must be doing cool shit besides saving the world and learning magic), these types of things I feel would make good \"grown up\" harry potter movies. \n\nOverall, the move felt very shallow and despite trying to take the Harry Potter universe on a different route, it just ends up returning to the same cliches and plot devices. I didn't expect anything, and was still sort of disappointed. 5/10.  ", "So far as I have read most reviews here are really positive.  But what can I say, I didn't enjoy it at all. I didn't have the same feeling as with the harry potter movies. Maybe it it because I am now significantly older. Not really impressed from the magic throughout the movie. There were some cool effects with the obscurus though. I enjoyed kowalski, graves and partially newt, but this Tina witch, I couldn't somehow feel any sympathy for her. Totally bland character. I thought that farell would make a very good grindelwald.  A shame that now Johnny Depp will play the role. Overall not an exciting film for me, unfortunately kind of boring.

He's a little awkward outside his own, specialized environment. He's pretty literal, better with animals than with people and obsessed would be an understatement. He's most likely somewhere on the autistic spectrum. Yet, and I love the movie for this, it's neither treated as a negative nor made explicit. This is just who he is.

That'd be epic! :)", "Fantastic Beasts is an awesome movie, and I **don't** mean to act like people aren't entitled to their own opinions but in this forum almost every negative thing I'm reading is **completely misguided.** I really hope I can clarify some things for you all.\n\nSkip to the end if you just want to read my list of implications, theories and observations.\n\nThe biggest complaint seems to be about character development and plot. To this I would stress perspective: this is a setup movie, the first of five films. The essential purpose of the film is just to introduce you to main characters and give you an idea of the political/social situation going on in the Wizarding world. The actual story, I would say, doesn't really begin until [Grindelwald is revealed](#spoiler), but the entire movie drops a plethora of bread crumbs for the next movies to follow as the characters are explored more. Then the adorable scene between Tina and Newt at the end....I think the character development is **excellent**, you just have to realize you're only looking at the roots of the tree right now.\n\nAnother big complaint is about Newt's carelessness. I only call that misguided because I just think that's part of JK's formula for making adventurous scenes. Giant spiders that nearly kill Harry and Ron, Pixies that hang Neville from the ceiling, flying car that malfunctions. It's like she applies Murphy's Law to all things magic and when you have a wizard with a suitcase of magical creatures, things **will** go wrong.\n\nAs it goes, though, the film makes every effort to display Newt's affection for his creatures, that they don't hurt anybody, and his determination to contain them all and fix the damage. Why should he care about the damage when he can fix it all with a wave of his hand? It's not disrespectful or arrogant, it's just taking advantage of magic. \n\nI *do* agree that JK is taking some shots at America, more particularly American politics, but let's think about that a little more deeply. The biggest insult is when Newt (in the only moment I found him arrogant) says all he knows about America is that they have backwards laws about interaction with non-magic folk. There is a clear intention to show that while MACUSA rejects the ideas of Grindelwald, their laws are dangerously parallel to his beliefs.\n\nOutdated laws separating one type of people from another type of people who are regarded as inferior. *Well, get over it Patriots because that's what we're known for.*\n\nThe other moment that was probably a shot at America was when they [received a death sentence after about thirty seconds of deliberation, also due to a stupid law](#spoiler). That was a little harsh but turned out to be an essential part of the plot.\n\n**How could you not love the fat guy??** He's useless? He's a bumbling idiot? **No way!** Kawalski is living the actual dream we all have whether we know it or not! Ever since we turned 10 and had to accept we weren't witches or wizards, the best we could hope for, **dream for**, is for a wizard to come crashing into our lives one day and just fuck everything up in the most wonderful ways. The scenes of him being astonished/amused were far and away my favorite parts of the film. How amazing is it that there is a character we can actually relate to in the HP universe? I can't quite find the words for it but to me it was a glorious glimpse of myself in a world I'll never enter. \n\nAnd to call him useless is just insulting. What about him [punching the goblin in the face](#spoiler)? That was the **opposite** of useless. What about his comic appeal? He was golden. That's purely opinion though.\n\n**Here is my little list** of theories, implications and observations: This is ALL spoiler so just, go see the movie first.\n\nStarting with Dumbledore and Grindelwald. It is mentioned that Dumbledore was a professor at Hogwarts and fond of Newt, so Grindelwald/Dumbledore's time together in Godric's Hollow has passed, Ariana is dead and Grindelwald saw her in obscurist form (possibly even killed her). Dumbledore went to Hogwarts and Grindelwald in search of power and the hallows, apparently ending up in America where he runs into Newt and the story really begins. It is most likely that Grindelwald already possesses the Elder Wand. \n\nHowever, I'd say with near 100 percent certainty that Tina didn't take control of the wand by disarming Grindelwald. The reason I know this is simply that Dumbledore *definitely* takes control of it upon defeating Grindelwald, which would imply that until that time it was still his to lose. \n\n*Why* she doesn't take control of the wand is a mystery. We know disarming Dumbledore was all Malfoy had to do to take ownership of it, and Harry disarming a different wand from Malfoy was sufficient for *him* to take ownership, so what Tina did should have been enough. Was it because it was Newt's creature that really incapacitated Grindelwald? Or, a really silly guess, because she simply summoned the wand (with \"accio\" charm) instead of using the more famous disarming/knock your ass backwards charm \"expelliarmus\"...hopefully this gets clarified in the next movies as I assume the Hallows will be coming up again and often.\n\nThe door is wide open to this series leading to an EPIC battle between Grindelwald and Dumbledore in 1945, and if that happens I may piss my pants in the theater.\n\nTina clearly has a very dark past to be explored. On the surface she appears nervous and unconfident, and yet she has a steely determination, is an auror (a job exclusively for bad asses) and even holds her own against Grindelwald (for like five seconds but still).\n\nI believe Queenie is a veela, though it was never mentioned. I think with Tina's new found respect and influence in MACUSA, the road will begin to open to law reform and Queenie will marry Kawalski, or their marriage could be what sets the stones in motion for change. \n\nNewt is said to know Dumbledore and have dated a Lestrange. You could expect this to lead to so many things. Maybe Dumbledore in America? Maybe as we get closer to the duel of 1945 the Lestrange connection will aid in the search for (or fight against) Grindelwald. \n\nI would expect the plot to continue following Newt as he pursues finding and caring for creatures while also following Tina and MACUSA as they search for Grindelwald after his inevitable escape. \n\nSomehow I think Dumbledore will come into it and lead Newt to focusing on stopping Grindelwald.\n\nWouldn't it be just great if Newt ends up giving Fawkes to Dumbledore? \n\nI think that's about all I have for now, thank geezus cause this took me a while.", "The highlight of this movie was the stunning visual effects and Jacob Kowalski. I will definitely go check out some more movies that his actor is in!", "I really enjoyed being able to watch a movie in the HP universe without worrying about it straying too far from the books. The movie wasn't perfect but it was a lot of fun to watch and I have faith that the sequels will be strong.", "I seem to be one of the few people who _didn't_ like it.  I mean, I didn't hate it, but it fell far short of my already moderate expectations.  There were definitely the seeds of a great story there, but as it was, it wasn't *fantastic* at all.\n\nOverall I thought the plot was disappointing, vaguely predictable, with the twist I didn't see coming being rather disappointing.  Characters were largely uninteresting, or irrelevant.  World-building was shoved down our throats instead of having it exposed organically as the story went on.  Visuals were good but I felt they were used as a crutch to supplement the story rather than compliment it.\n\nFrom the start, the whole setup for the escape of the beasts just felt so contrived.  I get that they wanted to get a muggle drawn into the story, but did it have to feel so forced?  And once it became clear that Graves was a Bad Guy, what the fuck was his motivation for offing Newt and Goldstein exactly?  Newt still believed Graves was a Good Guy, so why did Graves not use his position to force Newt to help him find the Obscurial?  I thought it was even going to be a setup for Graves somehow taking Credence's Obscurial power, since it was a huge point that Newt was able to extract the Obscurial from the individual.  Graves plan was instead to... coax Credence to just wreck havoc?  Like he was already doing?\n\nWhat was the whole subplot with the Senator and his father?  Why did they exist?  In the original books/movies almost every character played a role and brought something to the plot.  These guys literally brought nothing to the story and created a huge plot hole.  Credence/the Obscurial was doing plenty of damage on it's own without the need to make that damage personified in one individual.  After Shaw's death, and there's the battle in the subway, Shaw's father shouts \"That thing killed my son!\" so we know his memory of his son's supernatural death was not altered yet.  When he's later *obliviated* due to the rain, he presumably forgets everything that's happened in the last 24 hours or so, *but his son is still inexplicably dead*.  Sure, this can be answered with \"and after the movie a wizard crew visited his house and fixed his memory so his son died in a car crash,\" but it just seems *sloppy*.\n\nThe Obscurial being somehow involved with the Salem group was obvious.  How exactly was fairly well mis-directed, but overall we knew that was coming.  The reveal with Graves as Grindelwald was entirely underwhelming.  So Grindelwald infiltrated the congress in... how long was he missing from Europe for?  A couple months?  Was there an actual Graves he impersonated?  It clearly wasn't Polyjuice Potion, and you'd think a simple (Newt, after all, was able to reveal it) magical disguise wouldn't hold up in a government building.\n\nAs far as characters go, Goldstein seemed like something of a wet noodle.  Maybe after seven years of Hermoine being a clever badass the standards for leading witches are too high, but with both Newt and her being quiet, subdued introverts there was no real play off each other or discernible growth.  Eddie Redmane did a great portrayal as Newt, but his character was just kind of nonsensically written.  Like with the rhino-thing...  I get he's a magical biologist and wants to try and catch the creature in the most humane way possible, but is the silly dance really the best option?  For one, it didn't work.  It went and caused more damage, risked more exposure.  When instead he could have just petrified or stunned it.  THAT seems more humane.  And Kowalski just seemed completely uninteresting to me, although maybe that's appropriate.  If he's the audience surrogate, being introduced to magical America the same way we are, it'd make sense his rather blas\u00e9 attitude matches my own lack of amazement.\n\nAnd finally I just wish magic had been used *intelligently*.  Why do I have to believe that Kowalski managed to throw a cockroach into a teapot from across the room WHEN THEY HAVE FUCKING MAGIC.  They literally have universe when suspension-of-disbelief is practically perpetually on hold, and yet I still found myself saying \"yeah, don't really buy that.\"  I felt like they used magic as an excuse to have stunning visuals to fill in the fact that the story was lackluster.\n\n**TL;DR:** I *wanted* to like this movie, but especially seeing it the same week as Dr. Strange... it really just left me underwhelmed and disappointed.  I'd give it a 2/5, and that's mostly because it's being carried by the brand and I hope it improves with the next movies.\n", "Man, why couldn't Graves have been a follower of Grindlewald's? Wasn't a fan of the reveal and the seemingly throwing away of both Farrell and Ezra Miller. Everything was cool but it felt like they said \"oh we need to end the movie soon, get rid of these guys and show Johnny Depp, quick\". Farrell was cool and I want to see more of him. Voldemort had his deatheaters, who will Grindlewald have? \n\nAlso wish Newt had offered to take the muggle to Europe where they didn't have barbaric laws. \n\nThe ending with the mind wipes felt like a cop out. \n\nThe romance plot got a bit too cheesy at times. \n\nIf Newt has all that in his suitcase why don't most wizard communities reside in baggage? Solves the big problem of hiding from muggles nicely. \n\nThe whole concept of there being magical animals that are all over the world yet somehow have never been seen by muggles is so outlandish compared to groups of people hiding magic. Though the Wizarding world in general staying hidden is a big pill to swallow. Wish it was just a world with magic and no hiding really, would be much more interesting. \n\nOverall I enjoyed it, I just have a lot of nitpicks and I'll be annoyed if Credence and Graves (real Graves?) don't return. ", "Being a person who studies animals, I was really excited for this film. I immediatly understood Newt's introvert actions and his complete comfort around animals. Really hope people take something away from this, like understanding introverted people a bit better or how animals aren't necessarily wild killers because they're evil. \n\nI enjoyed this movie, but I don't feel like it was the most amazing movie ever. Still, I find it hard to point out problems. People seem to dislike the pacing and world building balance, I thought it was done well. I never felt like it was trying to do too much. For example, the third hunger games movie failed immensely to be interesting because it was a preamble to the final movie. This felt fine as a stand alone. The endings were just epilogue scenes, to give some closure on this movie as a standalone. Certainly not the first time we've seen that. It didn't feel like annoying endings, just necessary conclusions to each character. \n\nI was very happy we got to see so many species, I was worried it would be mostly character interaction. We saw a lot of different animals and the care for them. The only thing I didn't like was how Jacob never had the moment of \"STOP DOING THINGS AND TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING\" he just kind of accepted it and went along with everyone. A bit unbelievable to me, but excusable as they used that time with more interesting story. \n\nWhile I am sorry to see Colin Ferrell disappear, it's not entirely impossible that we won't see some form of him again. And why is everyone surprised he did a good job, it's Colin fucking Ferrell. You've got a lot to catch up on if you think he's underrated. I'm excited to see Depp's brand of crazy on this villain as well. \n\nI think it did a great job of introducing a new kind of world and characters, while still showing the beginning of a multi movie story arc, and still showing plenty of different beasts. I'm not sure how they'll work this in to these next movie (Fantastic Beasts 2? Or maybe a new name with Newt and another author?). But I'm sure it will be great. ", "What happened to the little colourful bee that popped up several times through the movie? Did they catch it?", "Ezra Miller's portrayal of Patrick in The Perks of Being a Wallflower was amazing and I love how he portrayed Credence in Fantastic Beasts.\n\nReally happy he's being cast for bigger films now. He's a great actor. Can't wait to see him as Barry Allen. \n\n", "I'd give it a solid B-, C+.  I liked the effects, I liked the creatures, I even like Newt's obsessive personality and Jacob's wide eyed amazement.\n\nWhat I didn't like was the plot.  Things were happening for no apparent reason, characters seemed to have no motivation for what they were doing.  I don't even know why the thunderbird needed to return to arizona?  I know it was mistreated in Egypt, but other than that?  Are there no clear open skies and rainstorms in Africa?  I don't know what Graves/Grindelwald wanted to do, and the entire bit with the second Salemers seemed like a massive waste of time.  Then they got to the end and Deus Ex Machina'd the shit out of everything.\n\n\"Look all better.  Nobody remembers anything.  All ok, sorry bout those corpses, but yay the bird's free!  In New York.... Which is exactly nothing like Arizona... But Yay!.\"", "We Need To Talk About Credence ", "[deleted]", "I went in with really low expectations because I watched a review saying they went with a superhero third act of a dust destroying a city. But i truly enjoyed and loved this movie even though I'm just a casual harry potter fan. \n\nHonestly this was 10x better and has more weight than a third act dust monster most superhero movies have, because you know credence is a conflicted character.

The look they decided to give Depp was laughable, literally. You could almost see the gel they used to spike his hair.", "I think the movie is good, but god I couldn't understand what Eddie Redmayne is saying. He's acting like he's still Stephen Hawking.", "I found it to be pretty disappointing. I think one of the reasons why the Harry Potter films were so successful is because they made you care about the characters, and for the most part the magical stuff that was part of the world building happened either in the background or came secondary to the plot. \n\nAs for FBAWTFT, I'm not really sure what the plot was. Scamander, who is so difficult to understand because he's almost whispering or mumbling all of his dialogue (for real, the last time I had this much difficulty understanding someone in a major film was Bane from TDKR), is chasing after creatures in New York...while this black cloud (I never could understand Scamander's pronunciation of the word they were calling it let alone what the explanation was) is on the loose in the city...while Grindewald is at large in Europe and has the whole world on alert...while a crazy religious cult is trying to usher in another persecution of witchcraft while one of their members may harbor a dark secret...while a newspaper baron is trying to get his son elected to congress...while the strangely cruel and brutal American wizards are scrambling to get a hold of the situation even though one of their own may have his own shadowy motivations etc etc. And it's all meant to connect somehow, but I'll be damned if I can tell you what's going on or who that character is and what they're motivation is. It's just so needlessly busy and confusing. There's so much going on and we're moving so quickly between set pieces that there's not enough time for me to focus on the individual stories that are trying to be told, let alone is there enough time or room for any of the characters to really develop. I can't tell you what Scamander is doing originally in New York, because he gives a motivation but then that gets explained away by another character with one line and then is never mentioned again during the entire film. \n\nThe cast has zero charisma. I've seen Scamander in other films and know that he can act, but why does he seem like he's impersonating Luna from the HP films really badly? He's so faux whimsical that you're surprised he can even tie his shoes, let alone wonder how he didn't manage to lose his creatures long before he arrived in New York. The other characters have very little depth to them. Nothing they do has any emotion, they just seem like they're going through the motions. When the audience is supposed to be sad when the muggle guy is supposed to get his mind wiped at the end, the story is playing up this alleged connection and sadness we're supposed to be feeling (like they tried and failed to do with Scamander's Lestrange love interest super late into the film) but who cares? I certainly didn't.\n\nThe effects are okay, but I think here it's missing the heart from the original films. Nothing in the original Harry Potter's existed just for the sake of spectacle, they were attached to the plot. Here, we see all kinds of magical shenanigans but none of it is consequential to the plot at all. Oh, a rhino has torn up a zoo? Nope, no one in the story cares in the least and has already moved on. Strange creatures in a bank or jewelry store? Again, no one really cares, none of this is resolved and has zero bearing on the plot. None of these creatures have heart or characterization like the creatures in the original films did, instead we're just meant to marvel at them and forget about them because the film moves so quickly to the next CGI creature that there's little time to develop any attachment at all.  All of these action scenes just happen and they feel so inorganic and lifeless. \n\nThis is so cliche, but for lack of a better term, I didn't feel like this film had any 'magic' to it at all. This is a film that feels more designed by committee than it does crafted out of love. This is a movie that felt really long to me, which is probably because it's paced so poorly. I just kept looking at my watch, waiting for it to be over. I didn't enjoy myself at all like I had in my previous adventures to the Wizarding World and that really disappointed me. \n\nI don't know how in the world WB is going to get *four* more movies out of this. I've seen the first one and am struggling to understand the story they've presented. I can barely imagine them contriving more magical creatures getting loose in four more movies so that Scamander can be loosely tied to the background plot. ", "I really, really loved this movie. It gave me such a great feeling of nostalgia. I may need to see it again to get a more objective opinion, but I just can't think of anything right now that I didn't like. The movie was just a delight to watch.\n\nJacob had such great chemistry with all of the other characters. The scene where he had to be obliviated was genuinely emotional. \n\nI loved getting a look into some of the wizarding history.

It *could* have worked with some tweaking, but they butchered that by literally forcing Grindelwald into the plot. The amount of *stupid* that creates is mind boggling. This *should* have been a simple magical creature hunt with Graves as a morally grey antagonist, hint at the Grindelwald connection (don't make him Grindelwald) and the movie is fine. The witch hunter plot *could* have worked, but only if they were a legitimate threat. \n\nOn a technical level the movie is atrocious as well. Yates might like dialogue, but he sure as hell can't film it with any sort of energy. Meanwhile the less said about how he films action scenes the better.

There was such wonderful buildup, great character motivations, the chases were thrilling, the beasts really were fantastic... and for what?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but I did leave asking myself, \"what's the point?\" Grindelwald shows up at the last second like a Scooby-Doo villain, says \"I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME YOU DARN KIDS,\" all of the build up with the Shaw's and the Barebone's is *quickly* evaporated, and then it's done.\n\nI will say the characters (which I always thought was Rowling's strong suit) were tremendously done, and it will be absolutely criminal if they replace Redmayne's joyous Newt with a newly cast Dumbledore as the lead character. His entire supporting cast was fleshed out nicely, and they all felt like they really clicked by the end - and got their naturally too.\n\nSince I'm feeling optimistic, this is a 7/10 for me (this is immediately after the leaving the theater), but the ending really let me down.", "This movie was a train wreck.

None of the characters really resonate; I wasn't rooting for any of them. Ironically, the most interesting character was Colin Farrell, yet the movie did not seem remotely interested in telling his story.\n\nThere was was really no plot (I guess the title should have been kind of giveaway that this movie had no idea what it wanted to be). It is essentially a composition of a bunch of random scenes focused on creatures that I guess J.K.

Kowalski is tossed around, teleported, implicated in a few robberies, regularly endangered, never made aware of what he's in for, threatened with having his mind wiped, etc and I don't even think any of them actually apologize to the poor bastard.

Newt felt way too \"Rowling-esque\" whimsical, and his \"war hero/victim of tragic love\" backstory was extremely tacked on.

Graves, aka Grindlewald, obviously had his own personal agenda, but none of his actions seemed to make sense in propelling this agenda.\n* There were two main plot lines that clashed with each other horrendously.

This is because solving algebra is linear whereas calculus and up requires a wisdom that spans multiple \"dimensions\".   \nI cheated because I read the book first so I knew what was going on beforehand but this little detail was something that I appreciated for its subtlety. The book proposes that the difficulty levels of algebra and calculus are switched so that for humans, learning algebra to calculus is easier whereas for the aliens the opposite is true (interesting to wonder what process they use to learn how to communicate with humans as ours is on a linear time frame).

It's not often musical scores stand out to me but this one certainly did. Film is at its core a work of art, and Arrival certainly qualifies in that regard.\n\nThe pacing does get a little slow in the second act, but it's required for properly displaying the monumental effort that it took to learn how to communicate even on a basic level with the aliens. The movie does a great job making both viewer and actor feel like they're learning together and that really helps with the immersion factor. Things are just open ended enough as to where you don't really know the aliens' true intentions right until the end so it keeps you guessing as to what they really want here. \n\nThe final sequence of the film left very few dry eyes in my theatre and this is quite possibly the highlight of a fantastic score with violin that perfectly fit the mood, capping it beautifully.

Go see it if you're on the fence.", "This film explores some scientific and philosophical themes:\n\n[The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) (Also referred to as \u2018linguistic relativity\u2019) is a paradigm in linguistics and cognitive science, suggesting that a learned language will physically alter the speakers\u2019 brain in such a way that the specific structure of the language will bring about particular changes in cognition, and ultimately how one views the world.\n\n[Eternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time) is an approach in the philosophy of time suggesting that all moments (past, present and future) are equally real; there is nothing special about the present. This view is opposed to [presentism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_presentism), which states that only the present is real, that we only exist *now*. In Arrival, human languages typically lead to their speakers becoming presentists. We tend to think of past, present and future as being separate categories in time with a unique asymmetry, where the past is set in stone, the future is open, and the present is where change takes place. In contrast, the Heptapod language is one that demands a non-linear view of time, where all moments exist equally, and therefore speakers of the Heptapod language tend to become eternalists. \n\nAs an aside, eternalism is the better supported approach. It is supported by empirical findings, such as those that are a consequences of the theory of special relativity. There is no absolute reference frame, or no absolute present moment. Two or more observers may disagree about what event is past, present or future, given their relative state of motion, yet all observers will agree on the ordering of events, event A can never come after event B (but it can be simultaneous with B).\n\nFor the Heptapods (and later Louise), language is primarily [performative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performativity) rather than communicative. The Heptapods (and later Lousie) are [prescient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precognition), and therefore have knowledge of events before they happen (from the perspective of a human who has a linear perception of time). So rather than trying to communicate with humans the Heptapods are using language as a source of action: They use it to give Louise \u2018the gift\u2019 so things move according to the plan. However, things are not moving according to anyone\u2019s plan--not Louise's or the Heptapod's--they are moving according to the universe\u2019s plan: all creatures are merely conscious observers, following their scripts and acting accordingly. Costello could not avoid his death, nor could Louise avoid her husband\u2019s divorce nor the death of her daughter Hannah. \n\n[Determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) and [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will). Given that both the Heptapods (and later Louise) have knowledge of the future, they, by definition, cannot change what will happen, given that it is not knowledge if they can change it. So I believe Louise was unable to alter her future, instead she learned to accept the necessity of events that transpired. Additionally, I believe that by learning the Heptapod language, part of the change that takes place in one's way of thinking, *is* this acceptance of the necessity of things. So where does free will come into this? Despite everything being determined, free will merely describes actions that are consistent with our beliefs and desires. To make a choice then, is for an agent to act in accordance with their beliefs and desires, even if those beliefs and desires are ultimately determined. Therefore, even though Louise knows what will come to pass, she still makes choices, given that what she does is what she wants to do. She *wants* to have Hannah and she *wants* to marry Ian. This acceptance of both free will and determinism is referred to as [compatiblism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism).", "10/10, best sci-fi movie in a long time.

Those things led to her breakthrough rather than arrogance, cavalierness, desperation, convenience or fear. Things which I think negatively impact on many other dramas that use those more 'hysterical' notions as a character crutch. It's a triumph for female characters in film.\n\n It's also clear that the story is the true champion here, but Villeneuve is among a small group of masters that understand and respect the power of story/the writing itself. Performers and directors who can smartly couple story with a restrained, undistracted vision of the most important things for an audience to see and feel.

Why would she do that if she knew how much it would hurt?\n\nAlso, I know it's not important to the plot of this film in particular, but I'm so incredibly curious as to what the Aliens meant when they said that they will need humanity's help in 3000 years.\n\nedit: I really don't think I could make the same choice that Louise makes.

He isn't really dead, since he experiences time nonlinearly. \"Death\" would just appear to be another state of being for them, a process they can go in and out of. Costello can simply go back and talk to Abbott. \n\nCostello has simply gone beyond the range of Abbott's time loop. But Abbott isn't really gone to him. As such Abbott didn't fear going to his death, he really isn't going anywhere, it's just that Costello is going beyond Abbott's reach, but will return momentarily.\n\nDeath is just a temporary process to them.\n\nAt least that's what I think.", "For those saying she made a a selfish choice: \nI don't think there was a choice.

He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\n>When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments.

These are both really interesting questions on their own that I was excited to see addressed in some meaningful way. \n\nAre our warlike instincts an inescapable part of who we are? Can we as a species ever overcome this part of us or are we doomed to be destroyed by it? The movie asks this and then answers \"yeah, if we figure out how to see the future\". It felt like it was dodging rather than answering the question, which i thought was an interesting one, especially right now. \n\nWe also have the problem of how to communicate with a being without being able to assume that it shares any of our sensory or mental characteristics. This is explored a little (\"do they even understand the concept of what a question is? Do they have a concept of an individual with a name at all?\") But then glossed over by convenient giving the aliens a lot of similarities to us (the ability to communicate with a visual language, and a spoken language which both happen to be in a range we can see and hear). This is a really cool problem, and I wish it had been explored a lot more, but it seemed half explained and we just sort of skipped forward until we could basically communicate with the aliens pretty well. \n\nIt felt like amazing ideas were set up, but then the writers weren't sure where to go next, so they introduced this non linear perception concept even though it introduces a lot of problems into the story, like time travel sort of stuff always does. Why did the aliens let one of them die if they knew a bomb was going to go off? What about the paradox of the general knowing to give her the phone number because she called him with that phone number that she learned because he knew to give her the phone number? I guess this gets into ideas about free will, predestination, and things of that nature, but these ideas weren't explored very much in the opening parts of the movie, which did a great job of exploring believable sci-fi concepts in a grounded way. It felt a bit out of place to me to suddenly get much more theoretical and abstract when I really liked how *real* the opening acts felt. \n\nTo summarize, I loved the initial premise and hoped the movie would go somewhere equally thought provoking with it, but felt that none of those concepts were really explored and the ending felt like it went too far away from what it felt like the movie originally wanted to talk about. \n\nA few other unrelated thoughts - the ending \"twist\" was really hammered into the ground for like ten minutes longer than it needed to be. It felt like the movie should have ended on the shot looking out the window of Louise's house, which is the same as the opening shot, which would have \"closed the loop\" perfectly and not made me feel like i was being beaten over the head with the twist. \n\nAlso, this movie seemed to follow Sicarios format of a weak and fearful female protagonist surrounded by strong male characters. It made more sense with Sicarios central concept, but was just distracting here. \n\nThere were also a number of lines that really fell flat, especially from the kid. I guess kids are really hard to write properly. And \"the most surprising part wasn't meeting them...it was meeting you\" was a huge eyeroll. \n\nThis movie did a lot right, but in the end I was disappointed mostly because it started off so damn well.", "\"Abbot is death process.\" Aaaand I'm crying in public. Such a subtle piece of characterization. At that moment we (humans) are on the same team with the heptapods. They become more real.

", "For anyone wondering how the ships worked:\n\nImagine Flatland. A 2D world that exists on the surface of a pond. There are little 2d creatures who can see in 360 degrees around themselves, but they have no concept of up towards our sky or down into the water. There is only x and y directions, they can't picture a z direction. Everyone they see looks like a line, but they can determine each others number of edges by feeling and observing as they circle each other. They have to watch out for triangles, those pointy angles could kill.\n\nOne day you find flatland in your pond. You speak and they hear you. You dip your finger into the water and it pokes through their world. To them it materializes out of nowhere as a circle, that grows in size. \n\nExtrapolate this concept to our world as flatland. They saw only a circle when we visited with a finger. I wonder if all 12 ships arranged together form a sphere. If those being could also exist outside time the way they talk about it, they might have dived into a great tapestry that stretched from big bang onwards, and materialized in our world. Perhaps they saw something 3000 years \"to the right\" of us on that painting of all space and time.\n\nI believe this is why the ships sort of dissolved out of sight. It wasn't teleportation or instant acceleration to light speed. They were drifting out of our time, kind of like the finger withdrawing from water's surface.\n\nEdit: You can take the idea further to explain more of the ships behavior too. Imagine the 2d world was on the side of a hill. The flatland citizens feel gravity in one direction. They have to use tools and their own bodies to climb and pull their way upwards. Once they get up to a 2d house they can rest easy inside it on the floor since it holds them up. If you inserted your finger it would hover in place with no floor to stop it sliding down the slope. They could take measurements around your finger but be unable to detect what was holding it up, since the forces anchoring it are outside of their space and comprehension.

There are a couple of sequences involving the alien ship that are just riveting.\n\nThis felt like everything I could have hoped for from a smart science fiction film. I loved the way things unfolded, but just to confirm as to my understanding, when Louise understand the heptapod language, her understanding of time and her perception of it changes (perhaps alluded to by the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis regarding how language affects the way you perceive and understand things). As her perception of time changes, she's able to see the future and is able to reconcile tension with the Chinese, and also sees her future with Ian, the daughter they will have, and what will become of her (which is presented earlier in the film as if its a flashback). She decides to move forward with her future because it will bring her that happiness which she wouldn't want to give up for anything else. I don't know if that makes much sense but would love other's opinions.\n\nAnyways I fucking loved this movie. Maybe I'm just a Villeneuve fanboy, an Amy Adams fanboy, whatever.

It feels like such perfect timing for this movie to come out right after the presidential election.\n\nI've seen several reviews from people that say this movie wasn't sci-fi enough, but I think the use of a first-contact plot to frame messages about the world today is science fiction at its best.", "In 3000 years humanity will be called upon to lends its culinary expertise in the preparation of calamari", "I really appreciated how the answers, behind the questions of this movie, weren't obvious right away.\n\nIt requires thought and serious reflection to understand the implications that this movie posed.\n\nAlso it's amazing how the director can convey so many emotions with the right choice of expression & sound.

All of his most recent works have been my favorite movies of that year, and each one exceeds the last. Prisoners, Sicario, and now Arrival. Simply amazing how he does it.", "I saw the movie on Friday and the more I think about it, the more I love it.\n\nI feel like watching the movie was kinda like learning a new language. We start watching the movie, interpreting the scenes with the kid as flashbacks, because that's how storytelling usually works. That's how we know time works. It's linear. \n\nBut the further we watch the movie, the more we learn about the aliens and the language, the more we realize that something is not like it seems. We learn together with the main character to interpret what we see and what we saw before differently. The flashbacks are actually flashforwards and we start to interpret everything we knew differently.\n\nMaybe I'm reading too much into it, but I thought it was really fascinating. Seeing the movie kinda translated the movie into a different story than I thought it was at the beginning.\n\nI was also pretty late to realize they're flashforwards, I only got it when she was in the chamber with Costello towards the end. My wife realized it much earlier when she told Hannah to ask her father \"the scientist\"  about the word. And then she remembered the word from what's happening in the present. \n\nI'm bilingual and the discussion about language changing your mind and how you think was interesting, too. I switched the language I primarily use when I was in my mid 20s and it definitely changed how I think.  The first day I had thoughts in the new language and didn't have to translate inside my mind anymore was the day I knew I was going to be fluent. So I can imagine learning an universal language like the one used in the movie would actually change somewhat how we think and interpret things.\n\nI also hope they'll release the software they used to generate the language. It'd be fun to play around with it!\n\nAnyways, great movie. \n\nThe names Abbott and Costello were so clever, too. Not only because the \"who's on first\" skit is basically a joke based on misinterpretations in a movie about interpreting a new language but also because the joke is circular and doesn't have an end. Much like the language and even the movie itself.\n\nDefinitely one of my favorite movies this year. It had its flaws, but I haven't thought that much about a piece of media in a while.\n\nGorgeous cinematography as well. I'm looking forward to the new Blade Runner now.\n", "\"mommy and daddy talk to animals\"\n\nHoooly crap. Its been a long time since I have been that blown away by a twist in amovie.

Enough people in here will talk about Villeneuve's direction and so on. I want to talk about that amazing score! Possibly my favorite score of 2016. Also, the visuals were amazing. A reminder, this cinematographer is also working on the Han Solo spinoff film. Anyway, I loved it. Can't wait to revisit this in a week or two.", "I saw it when it opened yesterday in NZ. I could watch a whole sci-fi movie consisting of scenes like the one in Arrival where Louise explains [the surprising complexity of teaching an alien to understand the sentence \"What is your purpose on Earth?\" They need to understand what a question is, that 'your' is a pronoun referring to specific entities, and also whether \"your\" refers to \"Joe Alien\" or actually the collective species of aliens that have come to Earth, etc.](/spoiler)\n\nAlso, I've been re-listening to the soundtrack on Spotify (it just came out today). Johann Johannsson knocked it out of the park. They're all so good, but \"First Encounter\" is just panic-inducing. It's got the three-note horn blast that repeats several times, and each subsequent time, you have a greater feeling of dread, partly because it drops to near-silence after each blast, and you know the next one's coming. It pummels you down with its simple repetition.\n\nMy one complaint is that I think this movie is too dark (in terms of brightness, not \"depressing\" dark). I felt like I was wearing sunglasses in the movie theatre for the first third of the movie.\n\nI wasn't spoiled going into the movie, but I knew the premise of circular beginnings becoming endings becoming beginnings, etc was important.

They came to earth to teach their language to humans, as a tool to understand time the way they do. But they only did that because they said they'll need the help of humans in three thousand years. What could they possibly see coming that they need humans to deal with?\n\nAlso, this movie had the bootstrap paradox - who stopped the war? Did Banks prevent war by convincing Shang to stand down? Or did future Shang get Banks to contact him in the past? How would he know to do that if she hadn't already contacted him in the past? Who initiated that interaction the first time? Or was there ever a first time at all?", "Guys.

It only gets better the more I mull it over! Arrival and The Lobster are my favorite movies this year. \n\n**Theories!** I think it's plausible to say that Abbot and Costello are the only two Heptapods on Earth, sent as messengers, and they're visiting the different shells in a cycle. This explains the 2-hour sessions, because there are 12 shells and this would fit into our 24-hour days. **Edit:** Remembered that incorrectly, it opens up every 18 hours. Womp womp.\n\nI believe that the \"gift\" was the ability to see time non-linearly, but not just for any John Doe who learns the language. Just for the chosen 12 people like Louise and Shang who were \"touched\" by the Heptapods. Yes, like others here I think Shang gained abilities as well, but not to the extent of Louise's. She can most likely see the furthest into the past and future.\n\n**Why do the Heptapods need humans' help in 3000 years?** I think we're asking the wrong question. A better one would be: *How* will humans be able to help? If the issue is something that requires much of Earth's knowledge and resources as a whole, it would help immensely if everyone could speak the same language. Also if it's a complex issue, being able to converse easily with the Heptapods would be crucial. \n\n**Why were there 12 shells?** Louise was given the language as a gift/tool so that she could teach it to others. Her book's title, \"A Universal Language,\" led me to start wondering about how the non-English-speaking world would learn. I'm no linguist and I can't remember most of the 12 cities they landed in, but I THINK it has something to do with 12 major language groups. 12 people including Louise were given the gift so that they could teach their people the Heptapod language. Imagine what the world could do if we all knew a common tongue. \n\nI had so many more thoughts but I'm starting to fall asleep, so I'll stop here.", "My only complaint is I wish I'd seen the seen where Louise tells Ian about their daughter, causing him to leave.

This movie, however, is flawlessly executed. It was perfect. It gave me what I always wanted: an amazing sci-fi movie that is human without being over indulgent in the science, drama, or action. Everything was perfectly balanced. Amy Adams was a revelation, as per usual. What an incredibly underrated actress. I felt this movie parallels her 'Junebug' acting, in that they are both realistic and earnest portrayal of a PERSON. At no point, to me, does she feel like merely a character or a plot device. She feels very human. \n\n[This movie also does a better job than any I can think of in it's portrayal of time as a non-linear dimension. It was very cleanly executed and wasn't leaned upon exclusively to drive the plot, which is refreshing. Additionally, the tenseness in the movie we feel over Adams is such a clever and subtle manipulation. Throughout the movie we are sympathetic and hurt on her behalf, an apparently grieving mother. We are manipulated into projecting depression, loneliness, and loss onto her before we realize it hasn't yet happened; and yet even when we realize that \"future\" Louise will undergo the loss of her child we are still rendered sympathetic by the newfound understanding of time.

Shang at the party is not confused, he knows exactly what he's doing.\n", "Great film. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s an adaptation of the short story \u201cStory of Your Life\u201d by the talented author Ted Chiang. Chiang\u2019s work is very highly regarded in the SF circles, and he is known for his talent of combining high concept science fiction with a very humane intelligence. His work is suffused with a calm compassion and precision. Villeneuve\u2019s biggest accomplishment here is that he managed to translate both these qualities \u2013 high-brow SF and compassion \u2013 to the big screen.\n\nThe cinematography is a highlight of the film, as it always is in Villeneuve\u2019s films. The camera often follows Dr. Banks, the main character, from the back, and tracks her as she is walking towards things that are as yet unseen. As if she is walking towards an unknown future. The camera sometimes deliberately withholds information to raise the tension, and then slowly pans to let us take everything in. And the effective sound design! The droning rhythm of the helicopter and the muffled sounds of the headphone, and suddenly the eerie tones of Johann Johannsson\u2019s score. Also something we\u2019ve seen before in Sicario, but it works like a charm.\n\nArrival shows a confidence to present an epic story in a very restrained way.\n\nSee the rest of my [review here](https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2016/11/10/arrival-2016-review/).", "I just want to yell FINALLY A MOVIE WHERE THE ALIENS ARE NICE!\n\nSPOILERS FOR DUNE SERIES AND CHILDHOOD'S END BELOW. If you haven't read them yet, READ THEM! They are amazing books, and if you liked Arrival you would probably like them too.\n\nSo, yeah, spoilers below...\n\nIt felt like the film paid homage to the book *Childhood's End* and the *Dune* series. The Childhood's End being that the aliens, of course, are suspected of possibly being malevolent. They are ugly and enigmatic. The difference being the aliens showed themselves and couldn't communicate, while the inverse was true for Childhood's End.\n\nThe aliens also said they needed humanity's help in 3,000 years. In Childhood's End, the aliens were kind of an \"Bodhisattva\" in that they couldn't reach a sort of enlightenment for themselves, Bodhisattva by choice and the Overlords by nature, so they assisted species that could. \n\nDune is another obvious one. Time being nonlinear, paraphrase \"What would you do differently if you knew your whole entire life?\" is a central theme throughout the Dune series, especially in *God Emperor of Dune*. Frank Herbert's idea seems to be that we would fine it tortuously arduous. I don't know the extent of the prescience in Arrival, but it seems very similar to prescience in Dune. Also, the \"three thousand years\" quote totally reinforced my suspicions that this was a nod to Leto Atreides II.\n\nCome to think of it, I don't recall seeing a film or even another book about prescience and its implications. It's a fascinating subject and something everyone seems to want, but don't know if how it will affect us.\n\n", "They spoke a lot of radiation (and the lack-thereof) in the shell, and other potential dangers that never seemed to come to fruition.\n\nBut I wonder if Hannah's cancer might be have been due to the fact that her parents spent so much time in the shell.  Of course we'll never know, but I wonder if that possibility weighed on both Louise and Ian and may have lead partially to his anger about what Louise told him the future holds for their daughter.\n\nOh, and what a brilliant little detail Hannah's name is.  I know they talked about the palindromic aspect of it at length, but I loved that its the same forward and backward the same way Louise can now perceive reality.\n\nPS.

I just watched it and the more I think about it the more I am making small to big connections and the more I am moved. The fact that Villeuneve has made the sequence of time irregular for us from the beginning of the movie like it is for Louise was just so masterful. Villeuneve has never failed me and is one of the few directors who makes me truly thankful for the capability of the depth of storytelling in the art of cinematography. \n\nIf you enjoyed this movie, even to the tenth of how much I did, please go watch his other movies. (And then message me about it so we can discuss it in depth. Especially Incendies!)", "I wish that I had seen the movie that apparently everyone else had seen, but alas I'm stuck with a film that I would've sworn was directed by M. Night Shymalan. I actually stayed behind to see who the director was and was shocked when his name didn't come up. Instead it was the guy that directed Prisoners and Sicario, which instantly made sense. This guy has a serious issue with pacing in his films, IMO. The first hour had me on the edge of my seat and was tense and eerie and then it all just falls apart quickly after that, pretty much like those other films imo. \n\nThe story has one of the hackiest twists I've seen (hence the Shymalan reference) that makes no sense whatsoever when you start questioning the film and it's events. Why didn't Jeremy Renner see the future as well? Why didn't he know about the daughter? Why did she have a vision where she knew the phone number if she had already called him in that future and thus would know the number while she's talking to the Chinese general? If she knew the alien language at the end (but the film teaches us that there is no middle, beginning, or end because apparently time is a circle) then why during the course of the film did she not know the language all along? Why didn't she tell everyone from the beginning about her convenient time visions and reveal that she knew what was going on all along? What is the ultimate point of having a child that you know will grow up to die? Does know one else find that morally troubling in the least bit? What was the purpose of the aliens coming at all? If they need human help in 3000 years, why not just come back in 3000 years? What gives the alien language the power to time travel and why would they need anyone's help if they have this ability? I reckon it would be really tough for rival alien factions or species to sneak up on them considering they can, ya know, see the future and prepare accordingly for it. Why is she having visions at the beginning of the film when the aliens haven't landed yet? How can she have powers at this point if this crucial event hasn't transpired? If she knows that telling Jeremy Renner the truth about her powers (even though he should have them too and should be doing the same thing as her) will cause him to break up with her and ruin their marriage.......then why do it? What does that decision achieve at all for her family except the dissolution of it?\n\nEverything that this film does, I feel like I've seen done better in other films. The grieving female protagonist who is in touch with aliens? Contact. The preachy \"we have to get along to succeed\" message? The Day the Earth Stood Still. The weird memory stuff/ heartbreaking daughter time travelling nonsense? Interstellar and a sprinkle of Inception. Midnight Special, which came out earlier this year, hits on some similar story threads as this film, but again, it think the former just does a better job. The drab, dull scenery? Take your pick. Modern cinema seems fixated on grim dark super saturated grey movies. \n\nI keep reading about how this really broke people's hearts and I'm just thinking...really? I can't think of another movie to compare Arrival to in its desperate ploy to emotionally manipulate the audience. The movie wants so desperately to make us cry that it ended up not making me cry, but instead annoyed me at the faux sincerity of its grief. \"Future me is totally depressed because the child that current me hasn't had yet has died and even though I know this will happen and is avoidable, I'm going to do it anyways and choose to let it ruin my life.\" What does any of this achieve? What is the point of having the ability to tell the future if that doesn't inform the decisions you make in the present going forward? That seems like a waste to me. I know I'm going against the grain here, but this one didn't do too much for me. \n\nEDIT: Come on guys, down voting for a different take on this film? ", "I really didn't enjoy this film. \n\nYeah, the cinematography and production design were largely fantastic, but everything from the script to the performances was cringeworthy. I was squirming around in my seat at how bad some of the lines were, and the ending had no impact whatsoever as Ian was given so little to do in the story. \n\nI'm kind of shocked this is being received as well as it is.", "Huh, reading over some of these comments, it seems I dislike this movie more than most. Whelp, let's get this karma sink rolling, shall we? Edit: Oh, and at least *try* and offer some refutation of what I say here that you don't like? Please?\n\nMy SO and I just saw this, and we both felt this movie was awful. By far the most overhyped thing we've have seen in years. There were just so many issues with it.\n\nGetting this out of the way, the best things were the visuals and the initial concept. Everything looked good (debatable the scene with her inside the alien atmosphere; they've already been shown to control gravity, so it's likely a very low-g environment, so could have just been a failure to really realize that) and was largely designed well. I liked the idea of the ships showing up, landing, waiting and then people figuring out what's going on. That was all good.\n\nI don't have much else positive to say beyond that. The story coherence was poor, and the characters and their motivations were absolutely abysmal.\n\nThe absolute most appalling aspect was the military. Every countries military. These guys were so gung-ho from the get go to start a shooting match it was ludicrous. No one pointed out that the idea of getting aggressive against a species that has shown mastery of interstellar travel and *gravity* is nothing but suicide. If they wanted us dead, they'd have parked in the asteroid belt, picked a few good size chunks of rock, and sent them our way. Or any one of a number of other ways. The aliens show exactly *zero* aggressive actions throughout the entire movie. They do nothing but sit there, for probably about 2 months movie time, doing *nothing*. Oh, and what has to be worst, **we've had first contact protocols since the 40s** and somehow they have *only* a linguist and physicist there, and they're making it up on the fly?! What the hell man?! The US only has one of those ships, not like they'd be splitting resources getting in more experts in other fields, to say nothing of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 25th, and 50th best linguists in the county working on the stuff, or anyone else. And where were the armies of other scientists trying to figure out stuff about the ship, like how it stays up there? Like I said, this is a race that has obviously harnessed gravity, maybe they should have had people looking into that. People like, I don't know, Renner's character? Maybe?\n\nThe most idiotic thing was when everyone shut down communications after learning about \"weapons\". Yeah, I have to call crap on that. Banks and/or Donnelly should have been screaming at Weber to get one of their allies (the UK, the Aussies, even the fucking Greenlanders) back on the phone so they can test their theory. That everyone would close up shop, even nato allies, that totally and that suddenly, is stupid. Like the smaller countries (again, Aussies, Greenlanders, etc) wouldn't be reaching out to the US if they felt the shit was about to hit the fan is so unrealistic it's crazy.\n\nCharacter wise, Donnelly and Banks had the chemistry of a wet match. They were the defacto love-interests because there were no other real characters in the movie. They did *not* earn their romance or future relationship. Looking over the thread here, Donnelly apparently had some use in the book but was neutered here except for that one scene near the end where he points out the missing information. You could remove him wholesale and lose almost nothing, which is a terrible thing for a lead. They developed nothing with him, nothing with Banks, absolutely nothing with anyone else either.\n\nThe best example of that is the saboteur character, Marks. Geeze, I didn't even know his name before coming here, that's how critical he was to the plot. He was background, and then we got a whole one scene to give him some half-assed justification for what he does. That's it? We don't even know what happened with him (killed in the shootout, captured and court-martialed, what?). They could have got rid of him without any consequence to the film, just have Abbot and Costello dump them out of the ship and when they land it turns out that someone else (like Sudan or somewhere else ruled by a totalitarian warlord) had a case of the stupid that day and tried to shoot at one of the ships or something, and now all alien craft world wide are on lockdown and the rest of the world is panicking over retaliation. That would have been a *better* justification for the mindless escalation of military tensions we got at the very end instead of \"Ohs noes, they might give weapon to our enemies.\"\n\nAgain, this is part of the problem I have with this movie's characters; they are nothing more than shallow vehicles to move the story along. There is no comradery shown amongst the soldiers, there is no interaction between them and the scientists, there is nothing. These are people stuck in the same isolated environment for *months* (again, at least 2 months by the movie's time), yet they don't interact. Does Marks ever try talking to the scientists? Find out what they're working on? Ask them anything? Eavesdrop on their work or chit-chat at mess? Apparently not, as we sure as hell weren't shown it. And that's a huge problem, when your human characters don't act human at all.\n\nI hated large parts of the sound design. The first time they went into the ship I felt the sound track was literally bludgeoning me. Terrible stuff.\n\nThe \"twist\" at the end was badly handled I felt. You never got any solid clue that they were flash-forwards, nothing that looked out of place, no odd background details, nothing. In the 14-16 years that they took over, *something* should have changed in some environment, some piece of technology, to give us a clue. The Heptapod writing should have been around, especially in Bank's home. But we saw nothing. [Edit] Okay, the only time we really saw it was when Hannah had the Plasticine heptapod, and I did notice that and began to wonder if they were flash-forwards then, but Banks never reacted to it, so I ignored it as well.\n\nThe best time to have the whole time-disassociation thing click, to tip the balance to both the viewer and *Banks* would have been when she starts writing like they do. She starts writing, they have their conversation, then she flashes forward to the bomb going off. She realizes what's going on, the aliens see that everything is clicking, she tries to go for the bomb in a futile effort to stop it (showing that time in this movie is a steady-state, that it can't be altered, driving home the fundamental message about the daughter), and they dump them out of the ship. From them on, both we and her have an idea of what's going on. You could have her write off some of it to after-effects from the concussion, despite we the viewer knowing better. The way it was done here felt like it seriously cheated the audience.\n\nAgain, overall, I did *not* like this movie. I went into it with very high hopes. It was stupidly well rated, for one. It looked like a solid, complex, hard sci-fi movie from a very promising director. What I got was a flat, simplistic film that didn't bother to populate itself with any characters to help bring itself to life. In the end, I found it a great idea, but an abysmal execution.", "Man, mind and emotions blown. Looking back, I really appreciated the scenes referencing the Chinese using Mahjong to communicate with the aliens. \n\nLouise correctly pointed out that using games to communicate can create confusion by framing conversations as competitive and win/lose, but I instinctively thought it was the aliens who would see it that way, not the other way around. It becomes abundantly clear at the end, when we learn a peaceful resolution hinges on General Shang standing down.\n\nThe aliens already knew the outcome hinged on Shang and tried to convey this to him, but he misinterpreted their references to No time and China being the first domino to fall as acts of aggression. He fell into the very trap Louise warned of.\nIt's small details like this one that keeps giving me a deep sense of satisfaction with the movie.", "Best sci fi movie in my opinion since Ex-Machina\n", "So much of my feelings of how amazing this film was has already been expressed here.

We're along for a ride. A linear one where we go from ignorance to experience to memory.\n\nHere, there is nothing at stake. The central drama of will the aliens help or hurt us, will we communicate, will we die... is irrelevant. Main characters don't need to save the world because it was never in peril.  The aliens would never retaliate. \n\n[They did not retaliate for the first bomb, and inexplicably allow one of them to be killed by it. So they would not retaliate to the Chinese attempts. The aliens know what is going to happen so they wouldn't need to play a tit-for-tat game.](#spoiler)\n\nOmniscience ruins everything. It turns Louise in to a monster essentially.  She does what she does AFTER contact knowing full well that it will ruin another person or two's life, doing so. That makes her a monster.  And really, we as humans live our lives not knowing what's coming and that makes bad outcomes from good decisions bearable. But we see multiple times in this film that the power which should change everything, changes nothing.\n\nAnd the central twist is all just pseudo-intellectual. A paradox, which SEEMS clever but it's just a paradox, there's no value there. And the other part is just manipulative storytelling. But after you get the story you realize the sad part that it doesn't matter.\n\nHer personal life drama after the event means nothing. It's just a coda to a story.  It doesn't change anything. Not the central question, not what we see on screen. Which removes all of the impact of it.  \n\nToo much pseudo in this movie. Not enough actual meat.  It basically just hides a paradox in an otherwise too slow and boring shell. ", "I just got back from it, and I am digesting it. \n\nOne of the most brilliant moments in the movie for me was when Louise is hugging Ian at the end both before they departed and when they are dancing. She knows what happens and needs to understand what to do.

", "[deleted]", "I watched the movie tonight and read several reviews and many of the comments here to try to ground myself, but it hasn't worked. I loved this movie. So damn much. It affected me in a way that a movie hasn't before. Mostly because of themes and circumstance, I'd guess.\n\nMy older brother is dying of brain cancer. My father was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer, and has surgery on Monday to determine if it has spread, which it probably has given the type of cancer and the time that he has had the initial tumor. It was originally misdiagnosed as a typical cyst. \n\nTonight, I chose to go to the movies alone for maybe the second time in my life. I've always had someone - a girlfriend,  friend, or family member that was willing to go with me. Tonight was the first time I didn't even ask. My roommate was throwing a party at the house. I just didn't feel like partying, so I decided to go see Arrival, since I loved Sicario, Prisoners, and Enemy so much. \n\nI knew it was some heavier, language-centric sci fi but I didn't know the broader themes it touched on. \n\nThe themes of savoring every moment and choosing to experience the rewards of an impactful relationship despite the horrifying ending spoke to me for obvious reasons. In fact, I kind of lost it at the end. I'm not normally the type to weep openly in movies but it was just so connected to my current situation that I couldn't help it. Weeped uncontrollably the last 10 minutes when I realized where the plot had gone and how it made me feel about my own life. I cried hard in the theater, then much harder in the car.\n\nThe broader themes rung true with me as well. The theme that we should learn to work together despite our differences hit home following the election. The fear and paranoia of the populace and nations was great. The sci fi concepts (being able to perceive another species, time being non-linear, etc.) were really well done to me. There was enough mystery and enough explanation to make the journey seem worthwhile. \n\nFrom a filmmaking, storytelling, and writing perspective I thought it was well done. There were some things to nitpick. Some characters were flat. Some character motivations were rushed, such as the soldiers being willing to blow up an alien vessel with C4 without much build up to support it...other than a YouTube video and a knowing stare. But I'm fine with those subplots being left on the backburner to fuel the larger, more meaningful stories. \n\nOverall, I fucking love this movie and can't wait to see it again. I really doubt I'll have another experience like this, given my current circumstances, ever again. \n\n", "#DicksOutForAbbott ", "I genuinely thought this movie was stupid and not entertaining.  I'd appreciate someone explaining why they think this movie was a masterpiece.  My criticisms are below.\n\nFirst, the aliens looked ridiculous.  A good alien should show us a \"novel\" design but also a \"functional\" design.  The novel design has to be such that the alien can DO what the movie suggests the alien can do.  Here, the design of the alien was cool in the sense that it equipped them to speak the language (squid + ink), but it makes no sense a giant fucking squid could make a machine like the one we see.  This isn't about the director \"challenging\" my ideas of intelligence, its about a fucking giant squid literally not having the dexterity to create the ships we saw.  Now you could say \"maybe other aliens\" created the ships but that's just lazy in my opinion.\n\nSecond, so time isn't linear.  And?  Why the fuck has this plot device become popular recently and why is it so amazing.  Yes, the beginning of the movie is actually the future.  And?  So the fuck what?\n\nThird, the aliens know the future, but they still need to reach out to humans for help?  If you know the future, fix it yourself, you wouldn't need to empower humans to do shit.\n\nFourth, dull dull dull characters.  Scientists don't have to be boring as fuck (holla to Matt Damon and the Martian).  But in watching this movie, did you care for a second about any of these characters?\n\nFifth, the daughter - why?  Why do we care?  How does this move the plot forward.  Fuck that, what was the plot?\n\nIn short, retarded movie.", "Offer Weapon.", "The tripod in the room, the lampshade that looked liked the alien hand, the focus that made the background figure look tentactile...the reoccurance of the glass barrier...brilliant.

There's very few films that leave me completely floored and this was definitely one of them. I knew going in that it would probably be pretty great as I've loved Villeneuve's last 3 films and Story of Your Life, but it really exceeded my expectations.\n\nA very special and unique film that I absolutely loved. Villeneuve has yet again proved what a versatile filmmaker he is, Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner give terrific performances and Bradford Young's cinematography was excellent. This film's feeling of hope and optimism really moved me and I can't wait to see it again next week.", "I wonder if the addition of emojis in our conversations is shaping a way of our thinking. \ud83e\udd14\nWhats the next step to improving communication to its fullest potential?", "This is the only movie in recent memory that I can unreservedly say that I loved it.

I thought is was going to be science smart, but it's just artistic and pretty ~~unlogical~~ illogical at times.\n\nAlso, I hate people downvoting everybody in this thread, who didn't like the movie.", "I've never been rocked to the core as much as I was the moment I realized Hannah hadn't been born yet.  Almost lost it in the theatre.  ", "First of all, this movie has made it into my all time top 5. I left the theater feeling like I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. It's a slow burning suspense that centers around a single concept. Just a concept and the need to understand it. The concept of time and its relationship to language and communication (and ultimately how we understand time itself).\n\nI couldn't stop thinking about The Traveler from Tau Alpha C (Star Trek TNG) and how he always talked about time and space being an just extension of our thoughts. Consider that time at its most fundamental level is just the continual cascading change from one state (of the universe) to another in a progressive and linear fashion. We cannot affect changes to time because we exist in time and lack the tools to make those changes (much like how without a tool like a mirror we could not see our own eyes because our vision is in our eyes, we cannot look back at ourselves). But what if that tool was a concept away? There are newer theories that suggest our brains' core functionality lies in quantum mechanics and funny things happen at the quantum level. \n\nThat brings me to the point in the movie about being immersed in a new language can force our brains to rewire itself to think in that language. The language you dream in is usually your \"primary\" language; the language you process thoughts in. It's common for someone to think of a thought in their mother tongue and then quickly translate it to whichever language that are currently speaking. But when the thinking language flips then the person's approach to thinking also changes. This point was made when Jeremy Reiner's character asks Louise \"are you dreaming in their language?\". It's at this point where we start to see that she's actively having these flashes of memory, and not some abstract story telling device. Before this point the flashes seemed independent of the current events, and seemed a lot like flashbacks. But after that question we see Louise actively have these memories, and at first her reaction to them seems to be sadness and distress from remembering, but we start to realize that it's actually confusion which in turn confuses us and makes us immediately relate to how she's feeling!\n\nNow why did we see the \"flash forwards\" at the beginning of the movie before Louise learned the gift? Well, that's the brilliantly poetic part. Despite others commenting that this was a cheap twist or a \"gotcha\" moment; it isn't. This is by design and firmly rooted in the concept of the story. The movie starts with her saying \"I thought this is where your story starts but it's not\" (paraphrasing, I don't remember the exact quote) during one of the first flash scenes, and the movie ends at the \"correct\" chronological moment as we perceive it showing a similar moment in time with Louise concluding \"***this*** is where your story begins\". The entire movie has a nonlinear approach to itself; a theme and concept constantly reinforced throughout the movie. The hetrapod's language was nonlinear and was physically expressed as a circle: no beginning, no end. So you could technically watch the ending of the movie first, watch the \"main\" part, then watch the intro last and it would still make sense. It's a complete circle.\n\nThe last line by Jeremy Reiner hit a cord with me (again, paraphrasing): \"I've spent my whole life looking up at the universe, and at this moment I'm most amazed by finding you\" (I think I butchered that quote). This line I find so deep and cheesy in a good way at the same time. There's a whole universe that we could spend a 1000^1000 lifetimes exploring and never reach the end, but in each person next to us there's also a universe to explore. All of our thoughts, beliefs, experiences, perceptions, knowledge, emotions, imaginations, and dreams make us all unique and we all need to learn a common language to share our universe. And because we're stuck in that pesky 4th dimension we need to do it linearly a little bit at a time.\n\nAnother thing that struck me was that not a single bullet was fired (aside from that one Russian audio clip), there was no action in the typical sense, and no one running for their lives. This film was extremely cerebral. Interstellar is another one of my all time top movies but that movie had more \"applied\" science, in that there built a space ship and used it to go through a wormhole and visit other planets. The Arrival is almost entirely a thought exercise. It was all about the logic to ask a question in a truly alien language. To me that made this movie so much more interesting. My favourite Star Trek episodes are the ones that center on scientific and logical conflicts, not physical and political ones. TNG: The Nth Degree is my favourite example.\n\nI think this movie might get a lot of negative criticism because it is too cerebral. I know far too many people who didn't like Interstellar and I know it's simply because they didn't understand it. They thought it was confusing and silly (their words).\n\nOthers have commented about the nuances about the questions asked, how they were asked, and a ton of other subtle facts that just keep adding to the brilliance of this movie. But I wanted to share my point of view and why I found it special. I've only seen the movie once so I know I'm missing a bunch of supporting facts from the movie. Aside from all of that, the cinematography and musical score were just knocked out of the park on this film.\n\nI cannot wait to see this again and analyze every scene knowing the outcome.", "Abbott is death process", "I really enjoyed the concept, it made me ponder so much. Having said that I found the ending underwhelming.\n\nMy favourite part was when Louise was remembering the future and her daughter was asking her for the term that describes a victory when suffering a loss. Louise was blanking on the term so she frustratingly told her daughter to ask her estranged father the scientist. Back to our perspective in the present... Ian the scientist talking to Louise refers to the term Zero-sum game, giving Louise in the future the answer to her daughter's question which she calls out. Her father answered her question over a decade before she even asked it.", "Just got out from this movie.  Best movie I've seen in years.. seriously.

Haha.", "[removed]", "Nobody is going to see this comment, but I liked how Hannah's name can be spelled forward and backward, similarly to how the heptapods view time.", "***SPOILERS***\n\nI think a very unspoken theme of the whole movie was fear, and how it forces us to make stupid decisions in the name of survival. I believe fear hampers the speed at which our species advances, because at times we choose to make rash decisions that might seem to benefit us in the short-term with no consideration of the long-term repercussions.\n\nThe aliens in the movie, due to their perception of time, seem to have overcome fear. The ability to know what will happen takes away all fear, and allows for considered, and better, decisions to be made. \n\nAs just one of many examples, had Abbott been fearful when the bomb was about to go off, he might have chose an option to save himself but kill Louise, which would have set in motion a terrible and devastating series of events. \n\nMy biggest takeaway from this movie is that if we are to truly advance as a species, we must overcome our fear of not only the great unknown, but of each other. In order to set aside our differences and work together towards a more common goal, we must not fear that our fellow man will stab us in the back, and not act on our instincts to protect ourselves above all else. \n\nI think it was a very beautifully done movie: entertaining, thought provoking, and paired perfectly with a blunt", "Did anyone else notice that the heptapod language resembles the [enso](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C5%8D) from Zen Buddhism?\n\n> ... a circle that is hand-drawn in one or two uninhibited brushstrokes to express a moment when the mind is free to let the body create.\n\nAlso within Zen philosophy are koans, check out [this fascinating parallel](http://zenopencircle.org.au/begin/intro-to-zen/koan-inquiry/):\n\n> Koans are that strange class of miniature stories, questions, images or even single words, which turn out to be holographic towards reality.

I actually feel quite calm and happy right now because of this movie. The circular timeline element allows for so many interpretations. My girlfriend was deeply intrigued by the whole \"free will\" quandary posed by it whereas I viewed it as a metaphor for life and adversity. We choose to live because despite all the pain and suffering, despite knowing that we will ultimately die, *living* and experiencing the small amounts of good are completely worth it. I don't feel as stressed about work because I'm able to accept that suffering is an innate part of life and that I should simply be thankful I'm alive to experience the good moments.

It wasn't a perfect 10 for me, but goddamn, it got me.", "Too much emotional manipulation for my liking. Just tell us what happened, not how to feel too.", "Wow I was simply amazed by this film.  Truly inspiring and amazingly directed.  Maybe one of my favorite WW2 films.\n\nInteresting reading the comments, seem to be the usual hate on Mel Gibson that he's a Christian propagandist.\n\nI'm as atheist as they come, but you have to admit that this man's faith helped him to endure true hell and be a true man and hero in such a difficult time.  It still doesn't make me believe in God, but it's powerful none the less.\n\nSure, there were some 'ok he's Jesus' shots like in most Mel Gibson movies, but that's just his thing.  I accept it, and honestly, I need it every now and again.  Jesus is an archetype after all.  The savior.  People get so mad at it (see the Matrix 3 hate), but it's one of the oldest archetypical characters we have in story telling.\n\nI don't understand the criticism I read that the enemy were faceless japanese soldiers.  So what, it's a movie about an American soldier.  Also, he helped out a Japanese soldier who was truly shocked and moved by his act of humanity.  \n\nMovie was moving as shit, fucking bad ass, and an awesome addition to the WW2 movie genre.  And it does something different which is to glorify not a soldier who kills, but a medic who is a conscientious objector.\n\nI give it 5/5 stars.  Mel Gibson, once again, makes a bad ass movie.\n", "The 3 seconds of the front lines just going at it. Good God what a strangely beautiful shot.\n\nUnlike people in my party, I also really liked how it ended with him being lifted out on a stretcher at the ridge with a slight smile and look of relief on his face. It didn't show him being welcomed home as a war hero being paraded or being given pats on the back by the people who hated him because that's not why he went to the front lines. He did it cause he felt convicted to help and he was just fine where he was. I really liked that last shot when he was lifted out (as weirdly digital as it looked).

It is violent, but I didn't find it gratuitous. Mel Gibson really does a fantastic job ramping up the tension; I was captivated and on edge for pretty much the entire film. The battle scenes are intense, the number of people killed is horrifying, yet Doss's courage is inspiring. The movie is really emotionally impactful.

I think after I remembered that this was a true story, it made me enjoy it more because that's just incredible. I usually don't get emotional with movies, but when the captain apologized and at the end where they show footage of them in real life, I was shedding some tears. \n\nAlthough the weaker point was definitely the first half, i did enjoy the depiction of the dad, and the scene where he learns the first son enlisted was stellar. The love story seemed a little rushed but I'm not sure what else they could do with the time they had. But I was able to forgive all the problems from the first half because the war part was just so moving to me ", "So I'm clearly in the minority on this, but I thought the movie was only good, not great. I wasn't a fan of the first hour; it was full of clich\u00e9s and came off as really corny during some scenes. It was pretty unremarkable in the way the characters and relationships were set up. The second half of the movie though was incredible and made up for most of the flaws in the first half of the film. The battle sequences were really, really, well done (although the Omaha Beach sequence in Saving Private Ryan is still the best in terms of war battles being depicted in film). Of course, the performances were all great as well. I'm surprised at how much I liked Vince Vaughn (I've pretty much hated almost every movie he's been in the last ten years), granted, I thought he was overacting a bit during the training scenes at the camp, but he eventually grows into his part once the Hacksaw Ridge scenes start. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of Hugo Weaving, thought he was fantastic, but once the guns start firing, we never get to see him again (same with Rachel Griffiths and Teresa Palmer). And then there's Andrew Garfield, who, for some reason, seemed like an odd choice to me, but he was quite good. Overall, I give it a 7/10. Had the first part of the film been better, my rating would have been much higher, but as it stands, this is a solid war film that requires some patience to get to the good stuff. \n\nAnd to just put it out there: I thought this was much better than Passion of the Christ, but nowhere near as good as Braveheart. I\u2019d put this on the same level as Apocalypto. \n\n", "Combat vet here. Iraq and Afghanistan. Nothing like.this movie. It seriously and honestly choked me up and my whole body was tense. I would honestly call the second half of this movie a HORROR war drama or whatever you want to call it. The hellish quality of the ridge when they first get up there then the slaughter that occurs. Nothing else like it. This is the Saving Private Ryan of the Pacific Theater and I would argue is MORE intense. ", "I've watched a lot of war films and this is the first since Saving Private Ryan to make me grip my seat as hard as I did. That first battle was incredibly well made.  Unnerving and disgusting level of intensity.  War is so fucked up.\n\nCan't really think of anything \"wrong\".  Just wish it had a longer ending.  Would've liked to have seen him come home to his wife.  The first half had me rolling me eyes sometimes at their relationship but I can't say they weren't cute as hell together.  Really good chemistry.\n\nHugo Weaving gave a downright perfect performance.  That dinner scene was so damn emotional. Dat lip quiver.  And Vince Vaughn was so damn good.", "Saw this on a Monday afternoon a month after it came out. I was the only one in the theater. This ended up being a good thing, since I audibly screamed out \"Holy Shit\" at least three times during the battle scenes.\n\nSo far as concerned, it's the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. It might have surpassed it even...I'll need time to reflect on the movie before I go that far.", "I just want to preface by saying that I absolutely loved the movie, and it was one of the most satisfying theater experiences I've had in a while. It was worth every dollar. I absolutely loved the performances and the end where we had the privelege of hearing from the people that were actually involved. The movie would've felt incomplete without that. I do want to mention one thing, though. Although I have absolutely no problem with it, the gore in this movie is very intense and anatomically realistic. Some people may may even say it was overdone, though I thought it helped create a stark contrast from the first half of the movie and gave a look at the horror of WWII combat. I mention this purely to say that people planning to see this movie with combat veterans should take that into consideration if they feel it might be an issue. The Normandy beach scene is rather tame compared to the greater part of this movie. All in all, I give the movie a solid 9/10.", "One of the few movies that I can confidently rate a 10 / 10 on IMDB.

I'm not one for 'war movies', I don't think i've ever seen a war movie in my life. But i'm on a quest to see all 9 movies nominated for best picture so this was 5/9 for me. It was amazing, I think. I cried at least twice, I was inspired and moved. Maybe i'm just not familiar with Mel Gibson's other works or war movies in general, or i'm not too much of a history buff so I didn't spot any inaccuracies. I came here looking for at least a few people who shared my opinion but I didn't find it lol", "Such a powerful film, there were many moments that gave me chills and made me tear up. It's a shame I didn't know about Desmond Daas until tonight.\n\nAs for Mel Gibson, he really knocked it out of the park with those action sequences especially the first one. It genuinely disturbed me and impacted me in a way no war film ever has. It felt like Spielberg's famous Normandy scene from Saving Private Ryan but with more of a personal touch to it. This is definitely one you shouldn't miss this year and a big contender for the Oscars on many levels. Very solid and surprising performances from the entire cast.\n\nI only have one flaw and it's that the ending felt too sudden. I wanted to see Daas reunited with his wife one more time before it went to black. Seeing the obvious CGI in the end took me out for a moment and left me just a little bit disappointed. Overall though, best film of the year. Congrats to Mel, Garfield, and the entire cast, this is a very special and rare film.", "I just came back from watching the movie. Holy balls, was that first battle scene was so intense. I caught myself looking away once because a guy got his legs absolutely blown off. I'm more surprised he lived after that.\n\nI thought the opening sequence was pretty crazy and Mel was just warming up. I'm a huge war movie buff and I have to say, this was one of the most insane, if not the craziest war film I've seen. Like I jumped a couple times. When they were going up the ridge the first time, in my mind I was like \"fuuuuuuck\" because in that artillery barrage I thought nothing could've lived in those blasts.\n\nIt absolutely took me by surprise on how the Japanese didn't give a single fuck.\n\nI actually want to go see it again later tonight. It was unbelievable.", "This has to be said. Some of these comments are just embarrassing, does no one research anything before they spew out random nonsense? For everyone who laughs at the body shield scene, that's serious morbid, only for the fact that that exact scene happen in real life.

But ignorance is bliss. Although several of you trolls are gonna say whatever you want and make up whatever you want to prove your point so keep that in mind all other rational educated others who know what they're taking about. That scene with the grenades also happened, On the night of May 21, 1945, just a half mile past the escarpment on Okinawa, Desmond's unit inadvertently walked into a company of Japanese soldiers. The unit engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy and Desmond scrambled to treat the wounded. \"They begin to throw these hand grenades,\" recalled Desmond. \"I saw it comin'. There was three other men in the hole with me. They were on the lower side, but I was on the other side lookin' when they threw the thing. I knew there was no way I could get at it. So I just quickly took my left foot and threw it back to where I thought the grenade might be, and throw my head and helmet to the ground. And not more than half a second later, I felt like I was sailin' through the air. I was seein' stars I wasn't supposed to be seein', and I knew my legs and body were blown up.\" The blast left 17 pieces of shrapnel embedded in Desmond's body, mostly in his legs.

Goes hard with the religious theme for like an hour of the movie. Instead of focusing on Doss learning medicine he spends all of his screen time on this ideological theme that feels like what a pastor would talk about in a church sermon.\n\nThen he goes hardcore with the violence to the point where it's ridiculous. I'm not squeamish when it comes to violence but the part where that meathead GI-Joe picks up a fallen comrade and uses him as a human shield.... it's almost disrespectful at that point. I get it's important to understand how horrific the battlefield can be, but you can't spend an hour of the film talking about god and being a pacifist, then spend another hour glorifying brains exploding, eviscerations, and burning Japs doing flips.\n\nHey and what's up with Vince Vaughn's second rate impression of Lee Ermy. The casting didn't make sense to me. Wtf was that dumb shit where He was dragged on a rug while he sprayed and prayed behind him with a Grease gun with pin point accuracy and never having to reload. Ya, nobody every reloaded in this movie.\n\nAlso what's up with all the guys  Desmond was in boot camp with. There's a guy from Brooklyn, and Italian, and some dude named Tex. All the side characters seemed very cheap take on classic war movies. \n\nOh what about the end scene. The ending seemed super rushed to me. Sooooo he plays handball with a grenade and gets pulled off the battlefield and at the same time they take the ridge, by the way the Japs surrender too and they commit sepeku. All while the generic score of the movie is blasting over all the dialogue. He get elevated on this ghetto gondola being made to look like a religious figure and the movies over. What about the entire half of the movie where they create the relationship with his wife and she is like \"you better come back to me,\" and they don't even include their reunion. What a waste.

But they don't necessarily make the film \"great\" in my opinion. There's a lot of flaws in this film.

Disappoints me that I thought that since most here seem to be loving it. First half was unforgivably cheesy and jingoistic, like a Norman Rockwell painting deprived of life. Every scene is lazily shot and directed up until they go to war. Most scenes were just medium shots and inserts, even in scenes that could have been potentially very interesting like mountain climbing or boot camp. \n\nBut Jesus, some of those war sequences are to die for. They're over the top and obvious but *exciting* as all get out. If Gibson brought the same level of enthusiasm and invention to the interpersonal scenes as he did to the carnage, this film could have been special. \n\nP.S. Disappointed with the way this film handled the Japanese. Every American soldier got a death that was either incredibly gory to the point that you felt their loss or noble enough to make them feel like heroes, while the Japanese were picked off like flies.

Felt contradictory.", "The only complaint I have about the film is that it ended. ", "So during the first 20 minutes or so, my sister and I were laughing at how bad this movie was. The \"love story\" was so rushed- it felt like after their third date she was asking him to propose. I know they were setting up background but I think they could have skipped the courtship or instead of rushing through it, just showed him already in love by the time we meet him as an adult. I felt zero connection to their story. \n\nI also thought he was supposed to be slow. We were laughing at his early conversations with his wife \"I need my blood back\" \"I need my belt but it's over there..\" \"it's five miles but I walk through the woods and it's seven\" I would have been truly creeped out by him. I thought maybe the brick to his head did real damage - it was just odd. \n\nHis dad was a flat character- the typical \"drunk\". When he gives the letter during the court marshal, was that his turn around? Were we supposed to love him then? Why is the dad so comforting to the girlfriend? Is he suddenly nice? I again was unmoved by that relationship.\n\nThe characters in basic training were so stereotypical. We felt like they just picked nicknames and accents from every region/ethnic group. There's Tex! He has a lasso. There's New York Italian kid, he's small but feisty! Look- it's chowder, our Boston friend!\n\nVince Vaughn? Just a poor pick. I love him but I can't see him in this role. He took me out of the movie.\n\nHowever! Once we were in war, I liked it. What an amazing story. He's a courageous hero and I had never heard of him. I liked the battle scenes as gory as they were - war is gory. I want to read a book on his story now. And I loved how he even sent down a few Japanese soldiers.\n\nIf we could redo the beginning of the movie I think this would be a strong contender. But the flat stereotypical actors, Garfield's \"is something wrong with him?\"  courtship, and everything before the war really killed it for me. ", "WOW, what an amazing movie. It had it all, moments that moved me to tears, moments I was on the edge of my seat with the amount of tension, and moments that scared the crap out of me. Andrew Garfield was amazing and Mel Gibson did a fantastic job. Definitely one of my all time favourite movies, maybe even my favourite", "Great movie. Specially the second half. Though I did not understand why didn't Japanese soldiers just cut the cargo nets that American soldiers used to  climb the ridge. But apart from that it was a very uplifting movie.", "Very good movie, I was a bit concerned about the acting from the trailer but Garfield did a good job. The fighting was absolutely brutal to watch. The most incredible thing I found was that Doss's deeds were even greater in real life than they were in the movie!

While I do think that a couple of sequences were too Hollywoodized, I don't think the film as a whole romanticized violence. I thought the battles were terrifying. It really showed the absolute horror of war. Also, any battle in the Pacific theater is going to showcase some of the worst fighting in WWII. I don't know how you're supposed to tell Desmond's story without showing lots of blood and gore. When you listen to the stories from the vets that were at Hacksaw Ridge that's the carnage they described: people getting limbs blown off, getting disemboweled, decapitations, and even people being torn in half because the machine gun fire was so thick.\n\nHere's a heartwarming fact.

Despite its corniness, this was a great movie.\n\nMy only real gripes with the movie is that we never see the brother again once he leaves, and I thought we might get another scene with his wife.

Terrible.\n-The beginning shows the two brothers have good relationship, the next is them beating up each other, almost killing eachother.

His timing during his lines and over use of him staring at his girl gave off more of a series mirderer vibe than a cute boy who was adorably infatuated with a beautiful girl. \n\nI hear so many people talking about how the religious aspects of the movies were subtle and not \"in your face\"- holy shit, one of the first scenes is him, as a child, standing in front of a poster for about 5 minutes, as we get a chance to look at all the commandments. \n\nAlmost every other scene had some heavy handed God talk- at one point, as Grenades were PERFECTLY blowing up all around him, he started speaking with God- literally! \nWhich is fine, but wow, did it ever smell of cheese once again as he \"receives te message\" and \"Bad asses\" or back into the perfectly choreographed explosives. \n\nMel Gibson is not back- we just want some type of weird \"he's not perfect, but he's still a genius\" come back story.

", "The amazing power of the true story in \"HACKSAW RIDGE\" can be found in its hero: Seventh Day Adventist Desmond Doss. He was a pacifist who never killed anyone or even carried a weapon. During the deadliest battle of the Pacific War, Okinawa, the call came to retreat, but Doss, an Army medic, disobeyed the order & risked his life to brave enemy fire in order to single-handedly save his fallen comrades from the front lines. \"Please Lord, help me get one more\" he prays each time he goes back for another solider. Doss displays such an astonishing level of selflessness he transcends war itself with a superhuman ability to love. It's so astounding one can't help but be reduced to tears by his actions & so unbelievable you will want to fact check it after you've seen it to make sure the events portrayed were real. They were.\n\n*There is something so bewildering about this film because its events, despite being true, are so literally unbelievable that paradoxically in order to make it more believable the filmmakers actually had to cut a lot out. (It's kind of like the way Apple had to create an algorithm to make their music player randomizer appear less random because its original state didn't seem random enough to users.) This includes but is not limited to Desmond's multiple wounds & many other heroic deeds not shown in the movie. In reality he performed many of his deeds while being wounded and even in his state allowed others to get treatment before him. His injuries were so severe that it took a toll on his body for the rest of his life. You can read Desmond's entire remarkable account by reading his Medal of Honor dossier.\n\n", "Wow I feel like a watched a different movie then you guys. I hated the first two acts of it.

Now I don\u2019t know about you, but when I\u2019m watching a film, I try to get sucked away into something, while with this film, with its incessant Christian Iconography and relatively cheap practical effects constantly reminded me that \u201cYes, this is a movie.\u201d and also \u201cYes, this is a Mel Gibson film.\u201d These are minor points though, because Mel Gibson is nearly a master of his craft, creating incredibly personal film with violence that truly feels mournful. Later scenes in the movie are reminiscent of the iconic opening of Saving Private Ryan, and the sound design truly emphasizes the weight of violence, be it from a knife entering a man\u2019s chest or a brick smashed across a young child\u2019s face.\nThe actors in this film are all in top form, with Andrew Garfield delivering a sincere, heart felt performance that never once feels as hokey as it could have. Hugo Weaving also shows far more emotional range than I\u2019ve seen from him in years and Vince Vaughn delivers a delightfully subdued performance as Garfield\u2019s drill sergeant. Overall, Hacksaw Ridge was an wonderful film, but perhaps not as iconic or memorable as Gibson\u2019s previous endeavors.\n", "One other thing about the movie is that as opposed to fucking Clint Eastwood and the sniper movie, just because they fought on the other side, Japanese weren't shown as evil and less human.

", "I'm sure this comment will be buried but **I am speaking as an Asian-American regarding the Ancient One and the casting of Tilda Swinton in a role that \"calls for\" a Tibetan or an Asian who can believably \"pull off\" the character of a Tibetan monk.**\n\n Heimdall needs not be white -- specifically of Nordic descent -- because his character in the films does not rely on any sort of Nordic personalities, if such a thing exists.  Heimdall seems to be one who is a staunch protector of the world, a loyal servant to Odin, a humble protector of Asgard whose modesty lies in his unfathomable ability to have literally, truly god-like ability in omnipresence but never flaunting it -- treating it more like a tool to perform his duty than an ability that can range from cool party trick to means to a selfish end. That type of character requires a quiet inner strength, which is why Idris Elba really fits the character well. \n\n**Regarding the Ancient One and the source material, arguably a considerable part of the character of relies on the character being an Asian male... or at least Asian.**\n\nThat's why I can *understand* why many Asians \"protest\" the film due to the outright white-washing -- not even cast with someone \"ethnic\" but with someone white -- of the Ancient One. \n\n***That said, who gives a fuck?***\n\nIn my opinion, I think the role was perfectly cast with Tilda Swinton, because she's famously known for her ability to portray androgynous characters, and the Ancient One -- at least in film form -- was wonderfully portrayed strictly because of Swinton's performance. \n\nIn the film, having a male Tibetan monk-ish mentor would have felt cliched, and on top of that, it would not have humbled Strange as well as she did.  That's why we get that initial \"bait and switch\" when Doctor Strange assumes that the old Asian man is the Ancient One, since they're in Nepal, he's dabbling in Eastern alternative medicine, and *everything he knew* led him to deduce that he was The Ancient One, while he bald woman attending to his coat was just a servant. \n\nThis little scene, in just 5 seconds, shows:\n\n1) How arrogant Strange is in terms of him outright defying the strict advice given to him: \"**Forget everything you know**\" -- and 30 seconds later he stubbornly refuses, consciously or subconsciously, to *surrender* his preconceived notions\n\n2) His further arrogance in assuming that a woman could not be a teacher or mentor or leader\n\n3) His own racial profiling in thinking that he'd be under the tutelage of an old Asian man. \n\nAnd that's just one scene. There are SO many reasons why Swinton was a homerun/knockout in terms of casting:\n\n1) **Her previously mentioned androgynous performance really punctuated the effect of the Ancient One's teachings, since he received all of that knowledge and training from a *woman*.** \n\nTony Stark was similarly cocky, arrogant. But his personality just doesn't lend itself well to being mentored by a woman. Imagine if in the cave, Yinsen was a middle eastern woman who was a brilliant engineer -- you think Tony would have listened?  You think his origin story would have worked?  *He's a womanizer*, and being stuck in a cave, there's a better chance they would have used blind spots to have sex than to build the Mark 1 suit.\n\nNearly all other Marvel films the characters' origins have been molded/created/mentored/guided/tough-loved by men or by themselves (as men):\n\n Iron Man/Yinsen, Captain America/Erskine, Thor/Odin, Daredevil/Stick, Luke Cage/Pops, likely Iron Fist/actual Tibetan Monks, Star-Lord/Ravagers (partially), Daisy Johnson/Coulson primarily, and Coulson is everyone's mentor, with Nick Fury above him, Vision/Thor, War Machine/Tony Stark, Maximoff twins/Baron Von Strucker, Elektra/Stick, and then with help from Daredevil to bring her back from the dark side, Ant-Man/Hank Pym (he was more of the mentor and catalyst while Hope was merely the trainer for 5 screentime minutes, literally, as she was mostly against him until he took on Falcon using her training) lastly, Spider-Man, assuming that like the other stories, Uncle Ben taught him about power and responsibility, and then Stark literally gave him his iconic suit and essentially extorted him into fighting on a larger scale than just Queens. \n\nThen again, I don't think a female stick would have taught Daredevil well at age 10 (since boys will be boys and they'd think a blind woman would be a strange mentor), nor would they have the same relationship once Matty got older (he's not going to fight an old lady).  As for Thor, no way he gets mentored by a female; Jane helped him with humility and humanity, but Odin taught the lesson and literally revived him back to god-tier Thor. Imagine Paul Rudd getting someone like Meryl Streep talking in his ear as Harriet Pym or an old Hope Pym, it just wouldn't work.  **But *oddly*, Strange's training worked well with a female but NOT feminine instructor.**\n\nThen, the ones who molded themselves are mostly male, like Hawkeye (good case could be made for Fury), Star-Lord (he was raised by Yondu and the Ravagers but became Star-Lord by himself, not even through a pep-talk from Gomora, although a case could be made that his mother molded him), Punisher, Black Panther (he obviously held his father in the highest regard -- but he clearly says \"i am not my father\" as he goes on a rampage for vengeance before becoming a more noble warrior at the end at the expense of watching the implosion of the Avengers), Falcon, Winter Soldier/Bucky (with some help from Steve, but Bucky was always a good guy who needed no mentoring, so good that he agreed to essentially be put on potential indefinite death just to protect the public). \n\nBlack Widow became skilled through a woman's control, but she arguably got \"reprogrammed\" by SHIELD and likely Nick Fury, once Hawkeye saved her life by sparing it. Jessica Jones got her mentorship through her BFF Trish and partially from the lesbian female attorney. \n\n**In other words, Doctor Strange is the first male Marvel superhero to get his training from and owing his entire hero-personality from nearly exclusively a female character in the Ancient One. But it was all subtext and subtle, instead of \"I'm being taught by a woman?\"** \n\nStrange is arguably the most assholish of everyone we have seen, up there with Stark, both pre hero.  That touch of a female mentor -- but asexual enough so it's not a *feminine touch* -- was perfect for Strange and his ego. **She dealt brutality and ruthlessness (see you on Everest!) typically reserved for male characters (see Odin), but had the patience, confidence, and belief (holding Mordo back from rescuing him not out of ruthlessness but belief in him) in Strange typically reserved for female characters.**\n\n2) On a meta level, I can confidently say they got one of the best actors, male or female, acting today for the part, and very few of those high caliber actresses would take that part where they'd look *bald* bald, not even like an alien blue bald.  I don't think Sandra Bullock or Cate Blanchett (my vote for best living actress today) or Meryl Streep or Jessica Chastain or Anne Hathaway would do that....plus they're too feminine anyway. \n\nTilda is an acting powerhouse, especially when it comes to androgynous characters, like Gabriel in *Constantine*. \n\nWe should be so lucky to have her take on that role. **This is a case where the best actor/actress for the role was cast**. \n\n3) In an ironic way, by casting a white female it shows that Marvel IS diverse in its casting. Casting an Asian Male would have just been thinking inside the box. \n\nCasting a white male would have been white-washing, since if you're going the male route, you should find an Asian male anyway. \n\nBut going from an Asian male to a white female -- who still instills and teaches much of what we expect the Ancient One to know -- it shows diversity. Diversity doesn't mean \"casting people of color for the sake of it\"; if anything, that goes against the principle, as you'd see skin color, you cast skin color. You see male parts you cast male parts. \n\nIt wasn't a big enough role in terms of general knowledge that the casting would have been heresy. For example, if they announced that the next Spider-Man was Jennifer Lawrence -- who is arguably a good actress, certainly highly acclaimed and a box office draw -- the film would tank because Spider-Man has been too fundamentally ingrained as a male character. \n\n**The point is, having \"The Ancient One\" in Nepal appear as a white woman is a bold and diverse choice, and the first 2 reasons -- a female mentor works better for Strange, and Swinton is a phenomenal actress -- makes this more than a token diversity casting.**\n\n\n**TLDR-- as an Asian-American male, the casting of the Ancient One was PERFECT with Tilda Swinton because she fit the character perfectly on screen matched with Strange, and Swinton herself is a masterful actress, and it never felt like \"token diversity.\".**", "I loved it. It was psychedelic, postmodern, exciting, fun, funny and dark all at the same time. Although I'm not normally big on Cumberbatch, he kills it as Doctor Strange.

The end credits scene just fucked my mind. Was Loki possing as Odin to protect Asgard? Thor says he and Loki came to New York looking for Odin so that means Loki doesn't know what happened to Odin, so he probably took his place to avoid all the wars in the other worlds from starting over again, or at least it wasn't an evil plan like one assumes from the ending of Thor 2. Maybe Hela has Odin, since we know she is going to be in Thor 3, I still don't know how Hulk fits into all of that, but is Dr Strange going to be in the Thor movie as well?

I'd rate the movie a 7/10, and didn't see it in 3D so can't recommend if that's worth it. \n\n\n\n**PRO**\n\n* Above all else the movie is visually stunning. The city bending in Inception looks quaint to how far they took it in this movie. Can be a little busy at times but many scenes are very acid-trippy and inventive. Fingers growing hands growing fingers growing hands! Many very straight up [Ditko comic book visuals](http://40.media.tumblr.com/20773f736ec606bac90a970722d7174b/tumblr_n5zuhojHfw1rur0aro1_1280.jpg) in this flick. \n\n* The time mechanics Strange mastered was a great twist on that almost Watchmen-like ending. You think when he arrives for the fight that he's too late, like Kaecilius (*Mads Mikkelsen*) is Ozymandias mocking him \"*I did it 30 minutes ago...*\". Then, as mentioned previously about inventive visuals, a fun fight sequence of the zealots and Strange while everything/one around them reverses in time. \n\n* Then the final fight between Dormammu and Strange. Wasn't some over the top video game boss battle. It was Strange completely outsmarting Dormammu without having to fight him. Putting them both into a Groundhog Day loop shows the character arc of Strange going from a self-serving cunt to one who is willing to sacrifice himself if it means he saves humanity. And he does so while also being arrogant about it, which was pretty funny. \n\n* MCU now has magic. Not misunderstood technology. Magic. So long as the audience is receptive to this it opens a lot of doors to future Marvel movie possibilities.\n\n* Mordo was well established as a character with his own personality and motives in this movie. And his departure at the end, then the end credits scene, show that he looks to be the next films villain. And one that has depth! \n\n* It was a funny movie, and the humor wasn't overdone imho. Surprised actually at the amount of humor from The Ancient One. I think her being more stern to contrast with the asshole-ish snark of Strange to bounce off of would have been better but oh well I'm not Kevin Feige so fuck it. I know I've seen a lot of \"*there's so many quips. quuuiiiiiiiiiiippsss!!!!!*\" but I didn't get that from this. There's some but it's nowhere near Joss Whedon territory that some are trying to make it out to be. \n\n**MEH**\n\n* Kaecilius was one more jenga block on the wobbly mountain of forgettable villains. After **14** movies it's bordering on unacceptable. However, to his credit, he wasn't just some guy out for revenge. He had some decent motive behind him that you can kind of understand. But he still has basically no background, no personality, it makes it hard to look at Marvel villains like actual fleshed out people rather than mcguffins. \n\n* This is an origin story with nothing shaking the mold. So if you know the template you know what's going to happen. Our hero has a bad day, goes on quest, gets training, loses their mentor, saves the day. It isn't that it's a bad formula, but when you see it over and over and over again you need to eventually throw a curveball. \n\n* The score. Wasn't off putting, offensive to the senses or anything like that. But the score blended into the background unfortunately, it got lost. I genuinely can't remember a single tune from the entire movie. I had to youtube the OST to try and kickstart my memory.\n\n**CON**\n\n* Rachel McAdams. Not her acting, she acted fine. But her \"*character.*\" I think in the credits she's listed as Prop #14. Wasted casting, wasted screen time. Marvel would have been better off with her not being there at all. Or even have her not be a love interest, just a friend. Instead the formula had a checkbox that needed to be checked so there she is.\n\n* Dormammu looks dumb. It's like movies can't adapt massive baddies or something. Fantastic Four did a dumb space cloud for Galactus. Green Lantern did a dumb fart cloud for Parallax. And Doctor Strange did some bangbros Alexis Texas butt ripples for Dormammu. [Would this](http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/square_small/11124/111247227/4756261-3029770-2055789-637558_dormammu_super.jpg) be too much to ask for? Just make him a cross between Sauron and a Balrog. I mean GotG gave us a proper CELESTIAL! And nobody complained that it was a goofy comic adaptation. People thought Eson The Searcher looked badass! Hopefully they can retcon his look at make him look like his comic form. \n\n* That CGI car accident. The whole scene. From the wide panning shots of the car going up the hillside to car spinning to the slow motion close up of the hands getting crushed. It looked awful. This movie just released and the effects looks dated now. They must have ran out of time and shoved it out the door good enough.\n\n* Others might not agree, but I found the pacing to be way too rushed. Introduction to crash to rehab to travel to training boom boom boom it all just happened so fast that no scene gives you time to breathe. The whole movie seems like they only are allocated X amount of time per scene then they need to push forward. How long did Strange train for, weeks? Months? Because it felt like a weekend. He goes from unable to open a portal to manipulating time itself and I just don't feel like he earned this transition/progress. This comes back to what I mentioned earlier about these movies having a formula and it's beginning to get tiresome. This movie felt like more assembly line than art. Visual spectacle can only take you so far. The Transformers series is visual spectacle but they're still shit movies. Doctor Strange has enough elsewhere going for it to make it fun and worth a watch, yes, but not enough to elevate it past the baseline. ", "I don't give a shit what anyone says. I loved this movie. The humor, the action, the visuals, the characters. I LOVE EVERYTHING. I also dont think it was a wasted villian, he was more like a regular person. He didn't exactly want to destroy the world, he thought he was saving it.\n\nIm going just not listen to anyone that says a villian was wasted before I see a movie. BECAUSE HE WAS NOT WASTED! He played the role the story needed him to play.\n\nThe twist that the Aincent One was a hypocrite. Christine was a great character\n\nI. FUCKING. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE!", "Quips by the lead. Quips by the supporting good guys. Quips by the villain. Any line that isn't exposition or foreshadowing is a quip.\n\nTerrible pacing that shifts depending on the needs of the origin story.\n\nInterchangeable, non-threatening, color-coordinated goons led by DTV action star, Scott Adkins, who is reduced from someone that could realistically kick Cucumbersnatch's head clean off to becoming a flying magic carpet's punching bag.\n\nRote, done-to-death superhero origin story, where the lead completely sheds his former asshole persona and ascends into becoming a hero to save the world from the villain that is sorta kinda a mirror of himself.\n\nZero tension. Maximum stakes!\n\nAbsurdly talented actor as a hilariously generic supervillain. SEE: Jeff Bridges, Tim Roth, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce, Christopher Eccleston, Robert Redford, Lee Pace, James Spader, and Corey Stoll.\n\nPower hungry supervillain with bland motivations who wants to kill the ~~lead/kill the main characters/~~**destroy the world**~~/annihilate the universe~~ because **he's**~~/she's/it's~~ a sociopath.\n\n... oh, right. To *Doctor Strange*'s credit, there are good performances, visuals and action to be mined from this. The best in any Marvel film in fact. But whenever the film wasn't shitting the kaleidoscope effect or being *Inception* on steroids, it was painfully dull.\n\nSuprisingly, Scott Derrickson has done a great job disguising yet another unsurprisingly paint-by-numbers MCU film by simply using a *different* coat of action and visual spectacle.\n", "I genuinely can't wait for Strange and Tony Stark to meet. If they don't utilize a \"no shit Sherlock\" joke in there, I'll be extremely disappointed. ", "As a long time Doctor Strange fan, I totally loved this movie! I had crazy high expectations for the film, and it met or exceeded every one of them. (Especially loved the ending!) Just want to get a few thoughts out while they're still fresh:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) Holy shit! The 3D is fucking incredible in Doctor Strange. Watching the city fold around Strange as he falls like a tiny speck in the middle of the screen was more visually stunning than pretty much anything we've seen so far in the MCU.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2) Cumberbatch was the perfect Stephen Strange. He played it with exactly the right amount of arrogance and charm. His American accent was weird to hear though! It might just be that I'm used to seeing him with a British accent in Sherlock, but it sounded almost like he was stretching out his \"A\" sounds. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3) I loved the final \"fight\" with Dormammu! Annoying the big bad into submission? Genius! The best part is that it allowed our hero to win while still showing how much more powerful Dormammu is than Strange. He just smushes him like a bug over and over - which is how it should be when you're throwing down with a dark god from another dimension. Strange defeats Dormammu by outsmarting him, leaving the door open for him to return as a primary antagonist in a future film.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n4) Plot-wise, there were a couple of weak spots. For example, I feel that they should have focused on one major theme for Strange's character arc. Either make the film about ego-death (which fits in beautifully with the Steve Ditko/Kaleidoscopic/DMT aesthetic), or make it about fear of failure. Not both. The end would have been a little more poignant if they had hammered home that Dr. Strange was the kind of person deathly afraid of failure (he has a line about how the fear of failure is what makes him such an excellent doctor). That way, the time loop ending shows us how Strange wins by accepting failure and dying an infinite number of times.\n\nAlternatively, if they had centered his arc around ego-death, my personal preference, they could have used the last fight to portray Strange's acceptance of pain. Spend a little more time showing how excruciatingly painful his healing process is, (Strange says he's no stranger to pain), how he struggles against it, and then the ending is framed around his ultimate acceptance that it is unavoidable as he is killed over and over, potentially for all eternity.  \n\nMaking one of these changes would tie up the plot a little more neatly and provide some nice narrative symmetry, while making the ending a little less comical. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n5) Regarding the Ancient One:  \nI still don't see the reason for changing the Ancient One from an old Tibetan guy to Tilda Swinton. Claiming that they are doing so to avoid offence makes even less sense when we realize that they included the Doctor's manservant Wong, albeit in a more progressive role. The true reason for the change was fear of offending the massive market that is *China*, by portraying a Tibetan as a powerful mystic leader. Ultimately, for a movie as steeped in East Asian and South East Asian influence as Doctor Strange, there was still a disturbing lack of brown and yellow people.   \n\nHonestly, Doctor Strange is one of the few comic book characters could benefit from a race change. Nothing about him being white is central to the plot. He could just as easily have been half Asian or Indian, etc. The old \"white guy travels to far off land and does asian things better than the asians that taught him\" trope. It's similar to the Iron Fist situation.   \n\n&nbsp;\n\n6) What's up with Christine Palmer? Is she the Night Nurse in the MCU? If that's where they're headed, then how will that reconcile with Claire Temple in the Marvel Netflix shows? They even had a throwaway line in Luke Cage referring to her as \"Night Nurse\". This might be more evidence that Fiege and co aren't interested in integrating the Netflix and cable shows with the movies. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n7) Why is the Eye of Agamotto, which apparently contains the Time Gem, just sitting in the library? You'd think the Ancient One would have it hanging around her neck, no?  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n8) Loved how they set up Mordo! His character was developed extremely well, with clear and logical motivations. By the end of the film, it's little wonder that he's disillusioned with magic and sorcerers. Hopefully, his character continues on this trajectory and doesn't revert back to the traditional one-dimension Marvel villain. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n9) The iconic Doctor Strange look developed piece by piece throughout the movie, even ending with the yellow gloves in the end-tag scene! And unless I'm mistaken, when the movie ends, he's not yet the Sorcerer Supreme - leaving Earth without one. That leaves us some nice room for growth in the sequel!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: 9/10 - easily in my top three Marvel films!   \n\nNow, how many days left until Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2?\n", "So I thought this was okay, I suppose. I\u2019d actually put my feelings for it at about the same level as the first Thor movie, in that it introduced a lot of cool concepts and characters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it didn\u2019t really do much for me as a film. It was just very by the numbers in the story and the characters, and while I didn\u2019t hate it, I just didn\u2019t get particularly into the film all that much. If you\u2019re a comic book completist like me, you\u2019ll see it anyway, but aside from that I\u2019d recommend just waiting until it comes to Netflix.", "I felt that the script was very much written by committee, but that's probably the hallmark of Marvel movies at this point. Solid, but nothing amazing.\n\nThe visuals were eye-catching but occasionally incongruous, and some of the platforming CGI was ropey - at least for a gamer.\n\nI loved that Strange was such a prick before his accident.\n\nMads Mikkelsen was completely wasted. Check him out in Hannibal. I feel like Marvel need to create more asymmetrical villains for their protagonists, but it doesn't look likely given Ejiofor's character seems to be the Big Bad for the sequel.\n\nAll in all, another solid, if unspectacular, entry into the Marvel EU.", "Another weak villain for Marvel, it's sad to see an actor like Mads Mikkelsen completely wasted in a throwaway role. That part could have been played by anyone.\n\nand speaking of parts that could have been played by anyone I was really disappointed how wasted Scott Adkins was. Granted most people don't even know who he is and I'm happy he's getting exposure in a giant movie like this, and not that I was ever expecting his role being anything other than a henchman(was hoping he'd at least be like Frank Grillo in WS), he's still fucking wasted. Marvel said Doc Strange was going to be more martial arts based which got me hype since I'm a big fan of those movies and when I heard Adkins was cast I got even more excited hoping he'd have a good fight in the movie. Nope. His little fight with Cumberbatch is my favorite scene but it's too short and the fights arent filmed and edited as well as the CG set pieces (they gotta cover up the fact that Cumberbatch can't fight), it's the usual shot too close and edited too fast as you'd expect. All the sparks and magic effects were also kinda too much visual noise, made it hard to tell what was going on during the fights.. Adkins is an incredible martial artist but of course Marvel does nothing with him and reduces him into a punching bag for a CGI cape.\n\nRant over. Most people will not give a shit about this.\n\nI liked the city bending set piece even though it was all a bit poorly mapped out and hard to follow. Wish I saw it in 3D", "I feel like I'm in la la land.\n\nFirst, the positives:\n\n- Benedict Cumberbatch was good \u2014 and I typically haven't liked him in his movies, but he was *really* good as Dr. Strange.\n\n- Michael Giacchinno's score was predictably nice.\n\nNow for the negatives:\n\n- Horrid, predictable, lifeless plot. Very stereotypical origin story that offered no twists or compelling moments.\n\n- Dr. Strange faces no real conflicts, or at least none that we actually see. His hands are broken, but only ten minutes later he is well on his way to being a master in spiritual arts. He is stabbed in the chest, but moments later he is fixed and forgets about it. Etc.\n\n- Time travel/reversing machine introduces the Superman paradox.\n\n- Bland, typical cinematography. No moments that are creative or unique. This, matched with the equally dull CGI made for a less than stellar 'metaphysical'.\n\nIt's late, and I won't be fully detailing everything right now. All and all it was a forgettable, disjointed, rushed film that offers nothing new to the medium and will no doubt be forgotten.\n\nMarvel seems to have fallen in their recurring trap.\n\nNo, this is not the new Iron Man, and no the 'deep' religious themes are not well thought out or defined.

Everything felt incredibly rushed. The car crash happens within the first 10 minutes, and Strange becomes a sorcerer practically overnight. The villain (Kaliscus I think?) was one of Marvel's worst and most forgettable, and Dormammu was even worse. Baron Mordu's arc made no sense at all. The visuals aren't even as great as they were hyped up to be. Sure in action scenes it looked alright, but anything that didn't involve people flying around, crashing into buildings, and beating the tar out of each other looked incredibly flat and dull. No interesting lighting or shots. The whole film felt like watching someone playing a video game. Cutscenes that they didn't care about that were skipped over just to get to the shooting. Overall, I think the filmmaking was the thing that disappointed me the most, this isn't a risk, it's just another superhero movie with a couple of scenes shot through a kaleidoscope that everyone thinks is the best thing since sliced bread.", "Did anybody else think the movie was a bit too...undecided?

Not the best MCU movie, but still a fun time at the movies and a welcome addition to the series. Some of the performances were great (especially from (EDIT) Ejiofor and Swinton), and the action set pieces were the most inventive action sequences I've seen in a MCU movie, but I did find that Marvel's quippy comedy, which has sort of plagued their passed movies, was in over drive. Every time an emotional scene occurred, a stupid quip or joke would happen literally right after, killing all of the emotional weight that was just built up. Marvel has been doing this for a while, but it's  starting to get corny and a bit annoying now. Everything doesn't have to be completely serious, but Marvel should let the films actually breathe and give them the space to hit different emotional beats. Also, I'd wish that the cinematography was a bit more lively during the more quiet scenes. The way that the dialogue scenes were shot was a bit uninspired and dull. Also, the film doesn't deviate from Marvel's repetitive formula and \"boring as fuck villain\" problem, which is a shame because Mads Mikkelsen should have been utilized way more.  Besides those complaints though, it was a pretty fun film. Didn't love it but I did have a good time watching it. Probably a 7/10, if I had to rate it.", "I really enjoyed the fight with time going backwards. It was more than just a back drop for the fight, the participants used it to their advantage. Grabbing a ride on scaffolding repairs, locking into a rebuilt wall, etc. I think I enjoyed that more than the trippy city bending fights.

Quickly paced.

The theme song is still stuck in my head and I enjoyed the witty quips as much as the incredible visuals. My only complaint is that the movie felt a bit short and that Mads didn't have more scenes with Strange, but the stakes felt real and I honestly thought that he would corrupt Strange for a moment. The scene between them both in the Sanctum, talking, was wonderful with the exchange of emotions. Awesome acting all around. There was a real vicious fire to Strange in the beginning when he was a broken man, that you don't normally see in superhero movies outside of Batman. My whole theater went OOOOOH when he was cruel to Christine. Benedict Cumberbatch was perfect casting, I know why they went through such trouble to get him to do this. I think his comedic timing was brilliant and wish he did more comedy. And that American accent! YES.\n\nI did love how they turned so many cliche movie tropes on their head like how he didn't get the girl in the end, the 'mentor' figure wasn't actually the old man he thought it was, and the way to defeat the bad guy wasn't to punch him into submission or pull a DBZ-esque powerup at the last second out of nowhere. I love the rules that they put in place to create tension--lose your sling ring, you get stuck, you can still get killed in the Mirror dimension, etc. Can I say how much I loved Tilda? She was beyond amazing and I was real upset when she died. I knew it had to be coming--the mentor always gets killed in these types of stories--but they'd worked it so well I cared very much about her when it came to it. That scene was so emotional. She's such a wonderfully complex character. \n\nDid anyone think that the Eye got broken for a second when everything froze when Stephen got near knocked out? I heard a cracking breaking glass sound and thought they were all trapped in time forever for a second!\n\nThe solution to the climax is incredible. I'm so glad we get to see a hero finally use his brain and cleverness defeat what should be an impossible villain. And his self-sacrifice was like a shocking moment, I honestly didn't expect that especially considering who he was at the beginning. And he remembers all those deaths!? That's one of the best heroic arcs I've seen in a long time.\n\nIt's rare for a movie to be this fun, create new questions that are fun to mull over, and make me crazy excited for the next one.

The people of this land are part of a society that protects the innocent from the forces of evil, and our hero is reluctant to join their cause. However, when an evildoer threatens his home and former lover, our hero answers the call of duty. He fights and defeats the villain, who was actually working on the behalf of a giant, evil space cloud, who is also promptly defeated.

We didn't know if he was going to blow up those ships or not. We like to be surprised. Childish jokes can't make up for it.\n\nI knew that Strange is not going to die, I knew that the villain's plan won't work, I knew that the world is safe and sound.\n\n\n\nA predictable plot is not THE problem though. \"Room\", \"127 Hours\", and plenty of films have plots that we can all imagine. It's the way that the characters grow that's fascinating! Strange surely had some character developments, but his story is like all other Marvel superheroes. \"I lived a good life. My life was broken. I conquered it with comic powers. Well shit now I gotta save the world!\" inserted with dozens of generic fight sequences that showed off the VFX. I loved the visual effects, but man! Why it has to be intervened in so many redundant fight sequences?\n\nI feel like Marvel is playing safe bets. Even the music sounds generic as hell! In one way, Marvel is doing a revolutionary work by building MCU. But I am sure that inside us, we all want Marvel to go \"creative\", and change the story telling of superhero films in a diverse way.", "\"The dark demension a dark and terrible place\" uses DC  filter and suicide squad colors.", "I like how Chiwetel pulled out his old Serenity move on Benjamin Bratt in the after credits scene. Apparently Pangborn's spinal injury didn't tear up that nerve cluster like Mal.", "I have to say I rarely leave a theater this disappointed but Dr. Strange has got to be the most hurtful of them all. So many things are wrong with this story's pacing and cohesion, the film constantly treats the audience like a child and spoon-feeds each and every new plot segment. \n\nMy first hint that things were going awry was the scene that sets Stephen Strange on his origin story path. Was no one else bothered by the fact that his entire story was spear-headed by a guy playing street basketball in Manhattan who basically told a total stranger \"Yeah my paralysis was healed, all because I went to this mystical temple in India and my mind healed itself. Also there are great forces there I was not powerful enough to control.\" Pause for effect. \"The temple you are looking for is bleh.\" Jesus Christ could the writers seriously not think of a better way to get Dr. Strange to India? The whole scene sounded like receiving a quest from an NPC. Like as a Doctor he honestly just took this random guy's word and spent his every last dime on a one-way plane ticket? Horse shit. \n\nNot to mention the absolutely rushed learning of his powers and skills once at said temple. It literally took him a handful of nights to be completely adept in his powers, so much so that he learned the spells to bend time after basically little training!?\n\nOh and the Mt. Everest scene. Are you joking. He is literally in rags at the altitude of a passenger 747 and hasn't even gotten a grasp on the basic concepts of his powers at this point yet. He would have been dead in less than 2 minutes.\n\nSpectral fight scene was absolutely horrendous and campy. \n\nWhy such a boring nemesis, again?! I'll give credit to his crying scene about trying to have everyone live forever, but it still didn't seem like enough. He needed some more fleshing out.\n\nThis film could have been amazing but it was an obvious cash grab and setup to Infinity Wars. I would have enjoyed the movie much more if it had just focused on his training and origins ala Batman Begins. The dawning of his cape or even just a slight hint at it nudging towards him in the glass would have made a beautiful ending. \n\n/rant\n\nTL;DR: Movie was extremely rushed and came up short for me on nearly all levels. Very disappointed and hope that future Marvel films are not written like this garbage.

Remember the scene where the experimental armor suddenly twisted itself almost 360 degrees?\n\nYet people dismiss that fact and instead think the guy was referring to Rhodes' accident in Civil War, when clearly his armor wasn't \"experimental.\" Just because they saw The Avenger's Tower at some point.\n\nSeeing the Tower solidified my realization that years have passed since his accident, it didn't make me think that this movie's timeline was after/during the events of Civil War.](#spoiler)\nAlso....

Cumberbatch, Chiwetel, Rachel, Wong, Mads and Tilda kill it. \n\nGreat CGI and action scenes. \n\nGood pace and balance throughout the film. \n\nAfter credits scene. I have this in my pros AND cons because although I feel that the scene wasn't necessary, it was a nice \"twist\" that Chiwetel (Mordo) has turned sides. \n\n*Cons* \n\nI feel as if Michael Stuhlbarg's talent was wasted in this movie. He literally has only three scenes, all of which aren't important. This was a miscast, or they should've given him more screen-time. \n\nFrom what I remember, that's not what Dormammu looks like..\n\nAfter credits scene.

The only redeeming quality was the cgi which probably would have looked better on the big screen.", "I think the impression I walked away with was that Marvel is playing in a very safe narrative sandbox still; all the beats you expect are hit pretty much where you expect them to be. However, there were enough small risks taken throughout the film that I feel made it well worthwhile. \n\nFirst and foremost, that was the most fun I've had with visuals since Interstellar. Even the fight scenes, though sometimes hard to follow, were at least distinct and fun to watch (wearing it's influences on its sleeve).\n\nThey're lucky the cast was as good as it was, they made a lot out of a little. As cliche as the dialogue and general direction was, I really appreciated the small plot risks that were taken. I like that the accident wasn't preordained or somehow deliberate, to be used as plot fodder - it was a well placed, if not heavy-handed, message about distracted driving. I really appreciated the moral of the story, it didn't come off as corny as it could've. It didn't come down to a Michael Bay climax - just a fun, if simplistic, bit of writing. I think it stands up to as much scrutiny as any other Marvel film, which isn't saying much, but all things considered it's the most fun I've had with a Marvel film in a while.\n\nBut Marvel for the love of god hire someone who can teach you how to write an actual female character, and not another charming cardboard cutout.

It had a lot more unique scenes than most of the other marvel movies have had.\n\nGrading it overall I'd give it a ~7/10, in terms of Marvel movies I'd say it's easily one of their best. I don't think the bar has been set very high. The first Iron Man had some similar issues while still being enjoyable\n\nI'm just not going to expect too much from them and be overly critical because I'll never enjoy a marvel movie that way.

Or why would a transplant surgeon want to assist with a neurosurgery?\n- Is she an Emergency doctor or a Neurosurgeon on call? Pericardiocentesis is a ED/IM procedure, but then why is she assisting with neurosurgery?\n- At the end of the movie they're all operating on Twilda without headcovers or masks.

Luv Tyler, Gweneth Paltrow, and Natalie Portman have already been cast off or abandoned their franchises. It's only a matter of time until McAdams gets the same treatment. Honestly only Evangeline Lilly is gonna make some sort of impact. \n\n- Dr. Strange is visually more interesting than other Marvel films. It is not structurally or textually more interesting. \n\n- Although I acknowledge the otherworldly nature of Tilda Swindon, I'm still disappointed that most of the students, teachers, and speaking characters of the magical realm are Westerners.", "I officially lost my complete interest to Marvel movies.

Cumberbatch did a fantastic job. Big fan of comic Strange so appreciated the little nods here and there. The jokes were good. Astral projection was really cool. The backstory of Strange was well executed. \n\nThat said, I had two big negatives. First, the use of magic felt very boring and unimaginative (the Inception stuff was cool the first two times then became distracting). I wasn't really expecting Harry Potter or Dungeons and Dragons, but it felt like there was no imagination to the magic, or that any of these characters were actually powerful (the villain only throws air spikes, come on...). Felt more like ninjas duking it out instead of actual wizards.\n\nSecond negative was the plot felt like it had no stakes, no gravitas. All the villain wanted was internal life... come on, we've had over a dozen Marvel movies -- you can do better than that. Mads Mikkelsen was wasted. Plus the whole Dormammu/Dark Dimension felt silly and not nearly as \"scary\" as it could have been. \n\nUltimately, I did still enjoy it, but felt that it was a more flawed, shallow experience than it could have been. \n", "This is only the second marvel movie I've ever seen (I think) and I liked it overall but I think they could have worked the plot differently.

Tilda's Ancient One is quirky, mischievous, and a little impatient. Very different from how ancient teachers are portrayed. Instead of forcing Strange to realize the strength and great wisdom just from her aura and tidbits of exhibition, she basically shows off to him. She doesn't let him figure things out completely on his own and comes off kind of playfully smug. Which makes it believable why she would look to Dormammu's power, break the rules she set, in order to do her job. ", "Absolutely loved the movie. There are things that disappointed. I wanted more scary scenes, the hands were the perfect amount of scary for me, just needed more of that and we didn't get it. The pacing did feel rushed at a few points, particularly the beginning, but when it didn't give that impression it was perfect. Mads had one great monologue and that's about it, so I'd place him in the upper half of Marvel's villains. Maybe some grand deus ex machina can bring him back for another go in later movies. I don't have much more to say negatively. I still give it a 10/10", "I hope that Strange's death loop is permanent.

Rachel McAdams character was so thin. I didn't give 5 shits about her. Oh a portal, what's going on? oh you're back, let me bitch about it for a second.

Rachel Mcadams and Ben Wong did great with their material but their characters arent fleshed out. They are like two dimensional cut outs thrown in to tick boxes. Chewitel Ejiofor gets a bit more of a personality but we know nothing about his life so he comes off as Marvels typical black sidekick gimmick. If this gets a sequel, they better do justice to these characters. \n\nThe physical representation of the dark dimension was shit. A big stupid face sitting in the middle of the multiverse speaking in that cartoonish villain voice. Was this conceived by a 9 year old?  \n\nThat said, great move making the ancient one fallible.

I do not know much about Doctor Strange other than the premise. Maybe that is why I was so confused. Nevertheless, as a huge Marvel fan, I am sort of dissapointed? But not really.

The Lost Symbol is best at this, followed by the Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons, and finally Inferno.\n\nSecond is that each book is a kickass humanities lesson. You learn so much cool stuff about...stuff from all the little details and intricate things that go on. Inferno reigns supreme in this aspect, followed by DVC, A&D, and in a distant fourth place: TLS.\n\nFinally its the big ethical/religious/moral dilemma that is presented. A&D discusses the relationship between science and religion, DVC is themed around crucifying the church and whether Jesus had kids, TLS discusses the idea of man becoming a god/god being within man, and Inferno talks of the dangers of overpopulation.\n\nMovie-wise, DVC is pretty balanced in all three. A&D is abbreviated but still has balance across the board.\n\nInferno tosses the fun humanities lesson to the wind. BARELY mentions the Divine Comedy, doesn't even sniff a fraction of all the cool facts and details the book talk about. The overpopulation deal is talked about with hardly any meat to the argument apart from simply being an important concept to keep the story going. It is barely presented as the issue it is, instead its  just the obsession of the bad guy.\n\nAnd finally, the story of Inferno movie is downright lame. It kicks off at 100 MPH and never slows down and yet somehow manages to be boring. We never get to see Langdon really show off his brilliant mind. The revised ending is a nightmare.\n\nBut still, the books story isn't all that great comparatively when you think about it. Its still awesome because of the other two factors. The movie rejects those factors and just focuses on the weak story.\n\nVery disappointing, but I think that The Lost Symbol is a strong enough story that it will kick a ton of ass when it finally comes out.\n\nAll that is in my humble opinion of course...", "Saw it last night, hate that they changed the ending and also some of the major plot drivers, I loved the book but would give the movie a 4 out of 10", "i said i was [gonna see it anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/57th62/tom_hanks_inferno_opens_with_50_million/d8veim4/) to see tom hanks uncover whatever outlandish conspiracy, but even with tempered expectations it was still a disappointment.  mainly because it was just a generic WMD virus plot with few themed historical puzzles and religious intrigue.  at least the other movies had the illusion of a grand conspiracy with the illuminati or rogue religious sects.  they sorta had something going with the secrets of the dantes inferno map at the start but that ended pretty quickly.  and the few puzzles it did have were incredibly hard to follow probably due to poor sound mixing and talking way too fast, like the whole message written on dantes death mask sounded like mumbling gibberish to me\n\nwhen i think of how cool the series can be im reminded of the ending in da vinci code, this one didnt even have anything as memorable ", "[deleted]", "Inferno is not as bad as what I expected it to be, mostly because I expected it to be utter trash, but when you have good actors, a good director and some fantastic locations that all helps.

For example, Jack needs to find a guy in New Orleans (which in movies is really just one street anyway), so he just leaves the hotel they're staying at and magically finds his wife a minute later. How? Doesn't matter. There's also really no sense of time in the movie. It's as if people just teleport from place to place.\n\nAlso, we get the predictable, \"I can be powerful too, even though I'm a woman!\" speech. \"I'm going in, I'm not going to sit here and be the babysitter just because I'm a woman.

I the first one, you have the shots from the sniper rifle zipping through the air in a higher pitched sound, and with no music and it sounded awesome. Same with the car chase in the first one, no music, just the sound of the muscle car. Lovely. \n\nThen in this one they dropped the ball. The guns were loud and bass'y with massive sparks and flames coming from the end, and the music was generic and detracted from the tension. The action cuts were too crazy as well, especially in the pointless car scene. If you remember in the first one there was that awesome shot that runs with the muscle car, starting from in front of the car, to the damaged grill, panning up to show Jack Reacher driving. No shots like that at all.\n\nI felt no connection between Reacher and Turner like I did in the book (In the book, these phone calls between the two happen through out (I think) at least 2 books before them meeting up.). If they had them speaking throughout this film while he was doing something else and that led onto a third film, that would have been interesting.\n\nI need to watch the film again, without comparing it to the first Reacher film to see if I would like it more as just an action flick. I liked The Hunter, and cruise is still a good Reacher I think. He has the mannerisms of Reacher down, especially the thinking on his feet and putting facts together (sometimes getting it wrong, like in the first Movie). \n\nI would LOVE a Jack Reacher film based on the first book, that is a very good Reacher story.

Just what the fuck happened.", "Copying and pasting my comment from the Reacher subreddit:\n\nIt was... ok. TL:DR, it had a very generic action movie feel to it, IMHO.\n\nA little more in-depth analysis, without spoilers: personally, the story never felt too engaging, there wasn't really a clearly defined mystery that had me intrigued, and the only parts of the movie I really enjoyed were when Reacher did Reacher things. Which I feel there were more call backs to the books in this one, and those call backs made me turn to my buddy (who's also read all the books) and give him a big thumbs up. But the story just wasn't as engaging as the first film, which may also be due to the fact that \"Never Go Back\" isn't one of the most interesting books (at least in my opinion). \n\nLet me go back a beat and tell you why I love the original film. The pacing was amazing. From the first scene, and the first notes of the score, the movie just grabbed me. It immediately amazed me how the first ten minutes are so intense, yet there is not a word spoken until after about nine minutes. The movie never rushes, and it doesn't suffer from the fast-pace editing. Every scene takes its time, but it never drags. \n\nAnother thing that I loved was the score, and lack of at times. The score has a very heroic, patriotic, lone wolf theme for Jack that I will be humming for days after watching the movie. But think back to the bigger action scenes of the movie (which don't dominate nor are overbearing); none of them are scored! The suspence and drama build in silcence, but that only enhances the scene, instead of being distracted by unessecary music. Think of the shootout at the beginning, the fight outside the bar, the bath tub fight, the car fight, and the big fight in the rain, all are score-less. But I loved the movie for it.\n\nI guess my biggest takeaway from this is that Christopher McQuarrie and Joe Krammer had a big influence on what made the movie so good. Which is what worried me when I learned that neither would be returning for the sequel. \n\nThe pacing in the sequel is a lot faster, and there is a lot more action. Whilst the original had action, it had more suspense scenes, and the action scenes weren't off-the-walls crazy. In the sequel, it felt like they went for the bigger-is-better approach. Which wasn't exactly what many book-Reacher fans had in mind.\n\nThe music: I absolutely loved Joe Krammers score for the original. I have nothing against Henry Jackman; I actually find his Winter Soldier score to be one of the strongest in the Marvel Universe. But after watching Never Go Back last night, I couldn't hum a single melody from the score. It felt extremely generic and dull. Perhaps it's ironic that Jackman has been doing a few Marvel's scores, because I felt like this sequel suffered from the [\"serviceable but not iconic\" scoring that many Marvel films suffer from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvwW2fs). \n\nLike I said at the beginning, I love Reacher, I really enjoyed the first film, and Never Go Back is ok... but I wish McQuarrie and Krammer had returned. It could have been better.", "This may be my least liked Tom Cruise movie. :(", "During the final scene with Samantha,Cruise really looks very old", "I do not understand why we have so many poor reviews.  This film was very similar to the original Jason Bourne film in that it was a \"thinking man's\" film.  No, it was not perfect and it really dragged halfway in (more editing should have been done to speed up the pace)....but then it picks up again at the climax.  What I loved was an apparent lack of CGI, the use of real stunt performers, the constant level of suspense at the very start of the film...and no shaky cam or overuse of ultra fast fights.  The diner scene could have been a cliche with another boring fight.  Instead, we are shown the aftermath of the fight.  The REAL fight is gonna take place between Jack and two Deputies.  And now Jack is in cuffs.  The main bad guy was interesting and I liked that he did not flinch when firing his weapon.  Tom Cruise seems to demand not just very attractive leading ladies, but he demands that they can ACT.  I loved the subplot between him and his possible daughter.  The mental chess match at the very end when Jack is ordered to drop his gun was great.  But I did guess what would happen and I blame it on the editing and pacing of that final scene.  It takes too long and gives us too much time to figure out how it's gonna end.  To see a perfect climactic gunfight ending...watch the original Die Hard.

It had the fluidity of a Bourne fight scene without the shakey cam, and the gun battles were very John Wisk-esque--crisp, intense, fluid, but not over-the-top.  \n\n**CONS:**\n\n-The motorcycle.

I can't really put my finger on what exactly, but it was edited strangely, like, things were moved or cut. Also I feel like this was made to be a PG-13 movie, but somehow was rated R. \n\nThe FBI story line felt SUPER pointless, like it was added in after the movie was basically done. The point of the FBI woman person was to tell the audience what was going on and they do this to a STUPID degree. In the funeral scene JK Simmons says, \"they visited the mother/wife,\" and they literally show her in the casket, then Ms. FBI comments \"They visited the mother/wife.\" Literally after he says it and she delivers the line as if she come to the revelation on her own. I can't believe how stupid the studio thinks the audience is. If you cut out the entirety of the FBI plot then, I think, the film would've been a lot better. \n\nI actually really like the twist that the Punisher and Batfleck are brothers because the kid who plays young Jon Bernthal is really good, like, he nails down his mannerisms. Though I do think it's a little hamfisted in some ways to the point where it could be figured out before the audience is supposed to know. I'm not saying it's blatantly obvious, but if it were a tad bit more subtle then it would've been a pleasant surprise. I also think the ending was satisfying except for the main villain, which I'll get to. \n\nIt worried me to see who was in this movie because I initially thought that everyone was added for their names, but they really nailed the parts. \n\nThe story is what I think bothered most people because of the unnecessary FBI subplot and the unclear motives for the CEO guy. I kinda just ignore the FBI subplot because it's just plain stupid and waters down the movie for me, but the thing I can't get over is the reasoning for bringing in the accountant to look over the company's money problem. Main villain man even says something to the effect of \"I don't know why I even hired you!\" Apparent, neither did the writers. Also I want to know if there was truly only one writer because it sure didn't feel like it, again, can't help shake the feeling of studio interference. \n\nOverall, I think it's a good movie. No way it deserves a score below 70%. If it weren't for any of the negatives that I've mentioned then, in my irrelevant opinion, I think this could've been the next Drive or something. I dunno, maybe it's because I have a MASSIVE hard on for Ben Affleck, Jon Bernthal, and JK Simmons...oh, and I like Anna Kendrick too. 7/10 is what I'd give it in its current state. I hope there's a director's cut. \n\nEdit: I just realized they work for the treasury and not the FBI.

I also felt that its portrayal of autism was done in good taste and I liked that they didn't go over the top with it. The performances were all solid, especially from Ben Affleck, who plays the character of Christian Wolff very well. I also really liked his chemistry with both Anna Kendrick and Jon Bernthal. Seamus McGarvey's cinematography work is stunning as always and Richard Pearson's editing keeps the film moving at a swift pace.

When the brother was conspicuously absent during the later flashbacks, I thought maybe they were going to pull a weird bait and switch where Ben Affleck's character was actually the younger brother who had trained himself in his brothers affectations. Glad I'm just a crazy person because that reunion was beautiful. ", "I thought it was great.  2nd act lost me a little being that the Robotics company's reason for hiring Affleck was a little too convoluted but the twist with Braxton genuinely surprised me and brought me right back into the film.  The ending with the Autism house/clinic/charity was touching too, tied the film together well I thought.  I thought JK Simmons' transition from weedy-scaredy cat at the Gambino building into his blackmailing-gruff voiced-Treasury agent was kind of weird.  The various tech-speak \"Get me a facial analysis now!\" was fucking ridiculous, along with the \"That's a 12-core isn't it?  Oh I'm an engineer.\"  Also, can someone explain why Affleck used his characters real name for his accounting firm in Iowa?  Or was that supposed to be an alias too?  I felt it was a little unclear.  Overall 8/10, good action, decent twist, good dialogue (no garbage Marvel quips as seems to be more the norm nowadays).", "I rather liked it. The action was fun and it all concluded nicely with the feelgood reveals.\n\nThe only thing I thought it lacked was expanding on the brother though. He went from silent rock to suave \"I got values\" guy. The reasoning is probably that he wanted to change from his old self by becoming the exact opposite but it really was startling to consider. And in the flashbacks he was just kinda there, felt more like he despised his brother from how much he glared at him for all he was getting put through for his brother's autism. \n\nI do think other than the brother not getting much explanation it was a very good movie, and it is kinda hard to fault them I suppose since nobody has any interaction with him other than his clients", "I loved it.  I usually don't get emotional from movies.  Especially ones about an accountant who kicks ass in and out of the office but the message of the movie on people who have autism and other learning disabilities really spoke to me. I just wanted to mention that I guess. I thought it was fantastic and Affleck was perfect at the little things.  It was an entertaining movie even outside of the uplifting elements it brought to my life.

I thought parts of the story were pretty good, but there were a lot of things that just seemed odd or out of place. I'm not a big Anna Kendrick fan, either. All in all, it was a fun movie to watch. I think my parents might like it, so I might give it another watch this week.", "The one question I have is who is the assistant /co worker that the accountant has that he calls. I think it has to be the puzzle non-speaking girl who uses the \"machine that can hack the pentagon\" and has to type out heavy sigh as she doesn't speak.

The story kept me enthralled, the acting was great, the action was fantastic, and surprisingly it was funny! I kind of saw the twist with the brother coming pretty early, but that never bothers me too much. IMO it's a really enjoyable film!", "Overall, decent action/drama movie with a heavier-than-usual emphasis on the characters.  Tricky movie to label in that sense, as it isn't as action-riddled as some might expect, but the action that is there is riveting.\n\nI can understand why critics didn't like it and generally why audiences do.  The central plot is a bit weighed down with the side plot that, at times, doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense.  Some of the other aspects may not be totally believable or too far-fetched.  However, the acting is competent and the movie itself is engaging.\n\nThe sideplot involving the treasury is something I still can't really figure out.  Why did JK Simmons have to blackmail this analyst into working for him?  Couldn't he have just asked or otherwise assigned her without the threats?  And why did Simmons make her dig all this information up when he apparently knew everything about the guy from the jump?  Was it just to get her invested somehow?  It didn't mesh well with itself or the rest of the movie, but there could be something more that I'm simply missing.\n\nI suppose the existence of this sideplot is a means to show Affleck's character isn't immune from the law but rather has managed to get on the law's side to cover all his bases.  It was evident that Affleck wasn't trying all that hard to avoid government scrutiny based on his business arrangements.  He's then feeding them information so they won't come after him, basically working as a CI.   I can't help but think, though, they could have tied in the law enforcement perspective better.\n\nThey also missed explaining some of Affleck's background, particularly his military involvement.  It was more or less glossed over through Simmons' flashback exposition.  They crammed a lot of information in that little bit of movie.\n\nI don't think these complaints amount to being as critical as some reviews have been; this was some hardy entertainment and it was by no means a bad film.

I'm very, to my self at times and engaging with people tends to be a challenge for me sometimes.\n\nI hate my food touching it's a quirk, but I felt certain connections like this and it was nice to see on screen. \n\nthe way this movie captured money laundering was spot on, especially with the front of ZZZ accounting. Wonder if that's a hidden meaning?\n\nI laughed my ass off and this was a big relief for how much tension filled certain scenes. Who the hell has a damn mini gun in their living room???? \n\nI was more surprised by the last reveal more so than the brother moment. It was a nice touch cause I wasn't expecting that with the girl being his contact. And I blame spectre for this whole brotherly reveal setup. As soon as they kept the focus on Chris's brother in the flashbacks I knew right away it was him grown up. And of course a lady next to me in the theatre ruined it by blurting it out. I had a few choice words for her but I kept that to myself l...............\n\nI wish they kept true to the accounting theme that was established early on. Instead it switched gears to hitman vs hitman. I wanted more of that big reveal and a more valid explanation. \n\nOverall I underatood the story just wanted more finance since I'm a nerd for this sort of thing. 7/10 \ud83d\ude42 ", "I thought that the movie was great!

It felt like a script written by two college freshman film students. Usually I won't see anything below 70 on rotten tomatoes but the fact that it was literally right at 50 made me think \"hmm, it's pretty divisive, that must make it really interesting!\" but no I was wrong. Here are my key points.\n     \n-Marybeth. First of all, it seems like her character was essentially pointless, since J.K. Simmons knew everything about the guy save for his name. Also, she didn't LIE on her application, if a conviction is sealed or expunged, it isn't considered as the same thing as happening an open DUI or assault charge or anything like that on her record. A stronger premise would have been she was so talented that they had to get her to nab this guy.     \n\n-The farmer whose taxes got worked on by Affleck - Why would Affleck agree to shoot at his house? And especially with his high-powered super duper sniper rifle? (unless the farmer had one that he could borrow.) Wouldn't that bring unnecessary attention to him? And would he even really need that practice at the farm when he's already so skilled at it? \n     \n-J.K. Simmons' character - apparently the moment you start to be taken seriously in the government world is when you shave what remains of your hair and go full bald.  If he was trying to figure out what Affleck looked like, couldn't he have looked at any sort of prison camera footage from all the time that Affleck spent with Jeffrey Tambor's character because they seemed to spend every waking hour with each other?      \n    \n-Anna Kendrick's character - For someone who just saw this guy murder multiple people in her home, she's awful willing to lean in to try and kiss him/get close to him. She's also remarkably not shaken up at all about what happened (\"Oh my god people broke into my home, oh wait this is a nice hotel\") And then when Affleck leaves, she just returns to her apartment and regular life with no problem? Did nobody notice the dudes who were killed there or the signs of a break in?\n     \n-John Lithgow - I still don't understand why he even orchestrated to have those other people killed. It seems it would have been much more convenient to tell them not to worry about the $60 something million missing. Maybe I missed something here but this whole plot point seemed contrived. Also, if they wanted to keep him safe, why did they still have him at his house and not a more secure, secret location?\n\n-Braxton - This was really the worst written part of the movie for me, and kind of irked me when the other people in my theater didn't immediately get the connection that they were brothers from the get go. He has the same skills and precision that Affleck's character has, and obviously there were two brothers training with each other that whole time. He is written as some douche bro mega-assassin, and then when the two finally meet, it's like the idea of looking for the other never popped into each others heads once over the years. \"Hmm, who could be leading such an advanced assault on my client's house? Could it be my long-lost autistic mega-assassin brother who holds all these advanced skills? No couldn't be.\" \"Hmm, people are starting to show up dead who are involved in the case I'm working on, and it seems to be by a really good professional. Could it be my long lost non-autistic brother who has the same skills  as me? Hmm, no it couldn't be!\" \n    \n-The lady who works at Affleck's accounting shop. Unless she just started that day or was a temp employee, which I don't think she was, I highly doubt that her knowing anything of Affleck's character would suggest setting him up with her daughter, unless her daughter was also socially inept. Also judging by the secretive nature of Affleck's business, I highly doubt he would actually have other employees. Also, when Marybeth figured out where his accounting shop was, why didn't they question her about him? \n     \n-Affleck's dad - Still don't really understand why he was training them at all. I get he didn't want his son to be a freak, but then why the other son? So he wouldn't feel left out? Maybe this was something I missed.\n     \n-Affleck - A lot of the movie seems to rely on the brevity that comes from fun at his character's disability, which seemed a bit tasteless and offensive to me. What is relatable is the frustration that comes with dealing with people with autism, which Rain Man executed perfectly. Tom Cruise is really frustrated with Dustin Hoffman because they have difficult communicating, and there's genuine humor that arises from that, but they never intentionally poke fun at Hoffman. Affleck's character though, it's weird, it's like every person he met or interacted with couldn't piece together that, you know, he's super smart but he's autistic and that's why he can't communicate very well and then they intentionally poked fun at that (\"hmm he gives strange responses to normal questions, HILLARIOUS\"). Rain Man made Dustin Hoffman's character human and able for us to empathize and relate to him, even though he had difficulty communicating and interacting with him. What this movie should have done is give us a moment really early on where we learn that his character is still a person even in spite of his disability, something like how he he seems cold and distant as a kid, but then comes across a ladybug in the grass and decides to save it. Really, it would've made more sense if Affleck's character was the one who found the puzzle piece for Justine and she were working on the puzzle, it would show that even under his tough, killing core, he still has sympathy for people at heart (\"That'd also make the whole 'I want to relate to people' scene with Kendrick at the hotel that much more meaningful.)     \n     \nI was really excited for this movie when I first saw trailers for it, and it could have been good if it was just a straight up thriller. Have Affleck looking at the books, Kendrick being a bit more shaken up than happy go lucky, remove the backstory with Tambor's character, have J.K. Simmons be the only person that trails Affleck, make the entire reason that everything is going down is because Affleck found something that he shouldn't on a routine but fairly high profile accounting job, and make Braxton more of a serious assassin than just the douchey guy with nice suits and snappy comebacks, make it so that Affleck retired from the high-profile international accounting/killing life and just wants to live quietly but gets pulled back into this nefarious underground world and now he has to survive it with Anna Kendrick by his side and you'd have a good movie.\n    \n\n    \n", "Just got out of the theater an hour ago, didn't like it that much.

Godzilla seemed like this messed up creature that was being forced to live against its will, its entire existence seemed like nothing but pain and that gave off some awesome body horror I thought.

", "I liked it coming out of the theater last night, and this morning I like it even more.  The main points of the movie being the commentary on slow moving Japanese politics, their hesitation (though not necessarily the chastization) of military force, and a look at how modern Japan may react to use of Nuclear weapons in present day.  These main points are a little muddled for western audiences as even if you do *understand* what they are getting at, it's hard not to get impatient during this movie (which is also sort of the point).\n\nWith Anno's directing style, you get a lot of quick cuts and shots that last only a few frames.  Anyone who has watched an anime, especially Evangelion, will be familiar with it but surprised to see how differently that style translates to film.  Anno pulled it off though, because that kinetic style makes it easier to keep interest.  \n\nThe scenes with Godzilla itself show that Anno could absolutely make full-on action Kaiju movie, and it would be amazing.  The scene where Godzilla first uses his atomic breath was actually terrifying, and so well done.  If he had made that movie instead, then I have no doubt that everyone would have loved it.  But he clearly had a vision for the movie, which was to bring it back to its roots with commentary on Japanese issues, and in that regard I would guess he succeeded.  \n\nAs for whether or not people will *enjoy* this movie, it's really a tough sell for anyone who isn't a fan of Godzilla, Anno.  It was a fun watch for me, boring for others.

He evolved and got his baby hands.\n\nThis is arguably the most OP I've seen Godzilla (I haven't watched all the originals yet) and it's pretty fascinating watching what someone theorizes a government's reaction would be to a huge event like this. \n\nIf you asked me to describe it in one sentence I'd say \"Hideaki Anno directs a monster movie as written by Aaron Sorkin.\" \n\nIt had all that luscious cinematography Anno is good for, but it felt strangely like a weird West Wing episode, especially with how fast things were moving at certain points.

In his first form they were ridiculous, and in all the following forms it just looked like googly eyes glued onto it.\n\nBut honestly it was just a lot of fun, I'd highly recommend it for any Godzilla fans out there.

The distraction of Patterson's odd English and the new introduction where Evolution Godzilla pushes thru the channel of cars were leaving me wondering if this movie would salvage it. Interesting that the U.S. bombs did penetrate Gmans body. \n\nAnyways. I'm going to see it again. That alone for me puts this as a great Godzilla film. The one I wanted Hollywood to do. Esp in the CGI dept. Remind us the horror of unbridled power run amok and how we climb over each other in a scramble for power during crises. The way our bureaucratic organisations deal to assert who's boss. ", "My initial reactions were:\n\nThis is In The Loop for Kaiju movies\n\nThey stopped the big G by roofie.\n\nSolid movie overall.

The scene where he nearly glasses a section of Tokyo with his atomic breath was quite powerful, you really get a sense of genuine hopelessness as it occurs. There's quite a bit of talking and politics, so I'd argue this isn't quite for everyone. If you're one of the people who disliked the Legendary movie due to a lack of Godzilla, you'll probably hate this. There's also the matter of effects; this Godzilla seemed to be mostly is not all CG, so some parts come off looking a little cheap and goofy. As someone used to cheap effects in Japanese media it wasn't too shocking for me, but I can see how that might be a sore spot for others. Having said that I did find myself pretty engrossed the whole way through, all of the characters are pretty likable, even the stock obstructive bureaucrat guy. The ending leaves itself open for potential sequels, but I'm not sure where they'd go from here.\n\nMechagodzilla seems like the logical step to finish off Gojira once and for all, but it feels like it'd be a little unrealistic for this universe. They could introduce another monster for him to fight, but it seems really difficult to portray this Godzilla as anything approaching heroic, and just freezing him at the end again would be a bit of a cop out. Whatever they go for I'll still probably buy a ticket.", "Somehow, this was the funniest film about government bureaucracy since Dr Strangelove", "If you are looking for an Action filled monster movie, you may want to skip Shin Godzilla. It isn't going to be for the average American movie goer. \n\nThat being said, I absolutely loved this film. Like I FUCKING LOVED THIS MOVIE.\n\n***SPOILERS****\n\nWhat would happen if Godzilla was actually in real life? Like hyper realistic, with dashes of drama. That's what this movie feels like. it dives into the actual politics and aftermath of a giant monster. Ever saw a Godzilla film or any Kaiju film, watch the monster wreck the whole city, and wonder what the aftermath of it would be like? Call for evacuations, worrying about the economy, scramble to find solutions that seem impossible? The anxiety and stress, not to mention the looming monster that'll make you think \"this cannot be real...\" \n\nThe whole movie is heavy dialogue filled, almost to a fault. I started to chuckle a bit at the amount of talking they do. Usually in Godzilla films, the monster shows up, and there is an instant mobilization of troops, jets and tanks. But this movies goes through every chain of command and department it can go into before even firing one round of ammo. And I'm sure that's actually how it works in the real world. I actually didn't know that Japan doesn't have a military until it was pointed out to me by a friend. That attention to detail is probably going to put off some movie goers, but I can't tell you how much I appreciated it. \n\nAside from the pace, the only thing I would gripe at, and it's pretty small, was that there was a scientist that had already mapped out Godzillas genetics before he even emerged, and that somehow led to them figuring out how to immobilize Goji. Just seemed like a deus ex machina to me.\n\nAnd of course they're going to have strong \nOvertones of the destructive power of man, nuclear waste, WWII, and the dropping of the atom bombs. A very blatant message that doesn't detract from the movie. Also, they randomly spoke English at the oddest of times. \n\nNow onto the monster. \n\nHOLY CHRIST, GODZILLA WAS BROKEN AND TERRIFYING!!! this is NOT like any Godzilla you've ever seen. They played up his radioactivity and nuclear power like no other movie. He was basically a walking reactor. And when I say broken, HE SHOT LASERS FROM HIS MOUTH, BACK, AND TAIL. And even had a radar ability so he could predict the military's moves. There were even big changes to his physical attributes, like more terrifying beast eyes, massive amounts of teeth, a red burning glow from his torso, and his atomic breath, was more atomic than I've ever seen. His mouth splits open when he blasts nuclear energy. That really stood out the most to me, In a good way. Watching Goji brush off missles and gunfire was spectacular, what an opposing force! This was not a Godzilla to fuck with. Not one to root for either, I found myself rooting for the the humans, not something typical of a Godzilla movie in my experience. \n\nWhen it first emerges, it has an amphibian like form, until it morphs into the Godzilla we're more familiar with. That part was a bit off putting, and honestly looked a little silly. But watching it morph and mutate made up for it, and was a relief. And it made sense when you understand the orgins of the monster. (Which is kinda made vague yet out right stated) \n\nThere's no real way to kill it without nukes (but they don't want to go that route for obvious reasons) So they figure out a way to freeze it, and it's explained that it'll last for 3 years until it will most likely return. So they have to coexist with it until such a time they can HOPEFULLY find a way to outright destroy it for good. There's a small teaser at the end that Babies were emerging from its tail before they froze it. \n\nFinal thought: \n\nIt's not going to be for everyone. While I enjoyed almost every bit of it, I got concerned for some of my friends who I invited out. Needless to say, they hated it. Not the conventional Goji flick that were expecting, And i didn't blame them. I just hoped it didn't soil their movie going experience. \n\nBut for select few, you're going to love it. This is a MUST SEE in my book.", "Did anyone else's theater cheer when they said \"Alright USA!\", when they thought the stealth bombers killed it?", "I think Anno intended this as an antithesis to the 2014 American reboot, which tried to focus on selected few human characters rather than examine the broad scope of what a monster attack will actually do to a country. In Gareth Edwards defense his breakout hit Monsters was also super character focus with the monsters as the backdrop for the characters to grow and develop. Too bad he didn't write Godzilla. \n\nAnno's take is hyper focused on creating a realistic (well, as realistic as a big dumb monster movie can get) \"situation room\" sceneario reacting to Godzilla. He is very good at building stakes and tension within the confines of \"people reacting to stuff happening on a screen and debating what to do.\" Every character introduced has something to do with finding a solution on how to deal with Godzilla. He balances social commentary with schlocky monster action well enough for me to reccommend to anyone who wants to see a different take on the monster genre. I personally loved it. As a longtime fan of Anno's work it was absolutely wonderful for me to see him have the resources to make a live action creature flick and have so much fun doing it. Also \"Decisive Action\" from EVA is in it and it's glorious.  ", "I enjoyed it a lot, but I had some problems with the directing and editing. The dialogue was non-stop, every time it would cut to a new scene the dialogue would start instantly. But that was probably the point, to demonstrate the inneficiency of the Japanese government and all of the bureaucracy. \n\n\nEDIT: The score was really good.", "Reminded me a lot of \"Eye in the Sky\" in regards to the politics. G looks awesome. Can anyone try to explain the last shot for me, though? SPOILER.......Where it pans up to the tip of his tail and it's human carcasses with dorsal fins coming out of their backs.", "Literally just got out of the cinemas, walking back to my car, fuckin' loved it. But can we talk about that final shot? Godzilla's tail with the humanoid skeletons growing out of it, what does everyone think that was about? ", "One of my favorite scenes was when, in a poetic reversal, Godzilla is crushed by Tokyo.", "Just got home from the theater. It was pretty entertaining overall. I didn't like the use of CG for Big G in some scenes. It just didn't like good. I think they would have been better served with guy in a suit with added cgi for buildings and explosions etc. Good CG for living things is hard to do even with massive Hollywood budgets. This movie didn't have that so it was going to have some rough spots in that area. \n\n\nThe cinematography overall was pretty good though. There were some really cool shots especially with the tanks and there was one scene from the point of view of someone fleeing in a car looking up at Godzilla that gave a great sense of scale. In fact there were several that did that. They did a good job of making him feel huge. \n\nI enjoyed the characters. The special team had some great ones especially but at times they almost felt like anime characters and not real people. I thought the casting on the US Secretary could have been better. It makes perfect sense the US would send someone who spoke fluent Japanese but come on, could they not find a single woman who could do that and speak with a passable American accent? I'm sure that doesn't matter for the movie's intended audience but it was a little rough for me. I know plenty of Japanese nationals and a fair number of them have no problem speaking with a GenAm accent in English. \n\nThe writing was pretty good and it was fun watching the characters poke fun at their own bureaucracy and ours as well. The initial government response of being paralyzed by lack of preparation, institutional rigidity and a fear of collateral damage seemed realistic. It's very different than the response the American government would have in a movie which would to quote president Whitmore be \"nuke the bastards\". At first I was worried they would fall into that Hollywood trap and portray the Americans that way but they didn't and the nuclear option was shown to be something nobody wanted but thought necessary. I also find that realistic. Nobody but a madman wants to use nukes. Nobel thought that dynamite would make man too appalled to fight wars. He wasn't wrong, just about it being dynamite. Turns out we need a bigger boom. ", "I really enjoyed it and that score gave me goosebumps. I'll definitely be listening to it for the rest of the week. \n\nThe film itself was pretty well paced and the scene where Godzilla went full on berserk mode with Tokyo up in flames was awesome. I thought the weakest part of the film was Kyoko. She just didn't seem believable at any point - more of a plot device than anything. ", "Just got back, probably the best thing I've seen this year. Really reminded me of Hunt for Red October where they have all of the science and politics stuff and also there's FUCKING GODZILLA. \n\n", "It was overall good, but a bit talky in some parts. The CG was pretty good for the budget as well. The only thing I didn't like were the lasers coming out of his back.

", "I absolutely loved it. The music, great acting from the Japanese side, and a super unique looking Godzilla. The first time you see him, I was baffled to all hell, and seeing him evolve over and over was really great.\n\nI loved the story and the politics more than the actual destruction, but it all comes together really nicely.\n\nI do have a question if anyone could answer it: do you think the ending was meant to symbolize that we are self destructive? Did anyone interpret that in any way? Anno usually layers his content with something more to it so I wanted to see how people thought about it.\n\nI also loved the camera work. I thought it was really different with the wide and long angle shots. Really fantastic movie all around.

Wanted to see the abort command go through 12 people all over again. The movie really tried to setup the horror of the prospect of nuking Tokyo, really tried to give the sense of overworked desperation for solving the puzzle but it was just 10 minutes too long. Maybe even 15. \n\nThat hurt the movie a good deal imo. But I loved the relatable characters, the fact that there was an actual purpose to the movie (Biting satire which was unexpected), there were some quirky characters which made it like watching a live action anime at many points (My noodles got soggy...) and then the stakes at the end really ramped up to world ending consequences. Better than 2014 which I loathed. ", "Copy-pasted from my review in the r/GODZILLA discussion thread:\n\nFirst off, this movie was pretty obviously not optimized for an American audience. I mean that both in the sense that it is very obviously a \"Japanese\" movie, moreso than probably any Godzilla film since GMK, or perhaps even Biollante. We'll discuss that in a bit. I'd also like to point out that this movie will absolutely wear you out with subtitles. There's a running gag in the movie where literally every new person or thing (tank, city district, restaurant hallway) gets its own subtitle when it's introduced. I don't mind subtitles, personally, but if you're a slow reader, you'll be struggling to keep up at times.\n\nSo, the movie itself. As others have indicated, this movie is, more than anything, a satirical look at the Japanese government and bureaucracy. (EDIT: as clarified below, this specifically riffs on the Japanese government's response to the 2011 Fukushima disaster). At the start of the movie, this mostly manifests as almost a comedy, with the bungling and foot-dragging of various officials and ministers being played for laughs, even as an also vaguely comical-looking \"first form\" Godzilla rampages through the Tokyo riverfront. If you're willing to buy the movie's conceit here, this first third or so if the movie is pretty snappy and enjoyable. The dialogue I would almost call Sorkin-esque. Very rapid fire, full of technical jargon, with a lot of understated or sardonic laugh lines.\n\nThe movie gets more and more grim as time goes on, however, with the comedy taking back bench to straightforward drama. The most obvious turning point is when the Prime Minister and much of the cabinet is killed during Godzilla's atomic breath attack, giving our intrepid heroes (a collection of younger, low-level bureaucrats chafing under the ossified seniority system of the Japanese government) a chance to take risks and generally respond to Godzilla's attack with outside-the-box thinking.\n\nWe've gotten all this way through the review without actually talking about Godzilla much, so let's do that. Yes, this Godzilla design (or designs, to be more precise) is radically different from anything we've seen before in the franchise. Without getting too far into the weeds, basically Godzilla is a collection of microrganisms that fused together through some unknown process and evolved to feed on radioactive waste. It is able to rapidly mutate, allowing for it to shift forms throughout the film. All that being said, the \"final form\" is essentially close enough to what we know to be \"Godzilla\" for all intents and purposes, but the early forms of the Big G in this film are a bit \"out there\" in terms of design.\n\nGodzilla is also, as you may have heard, not especially active throughout the film; I would guess that the screentime of Godzilla actively doing something during the film would clock in at somewhere between 12 and 15 minutes, and maybe 3 to 5 of that is the \"early stage\" of Godzilla. So, basically, the movie is gonna succeed or fail for you based on how well it's able to hold your interest in the scenes between the Godzilla action.\n\nThe Godzilla action, by the way, is awesome. The effects are surprisingly good, considering that this is made for a fraction of the cost of your typical Hollywood blockbuster. The military's confrontation with Godzilla, as previewed in the film's trailer, is everything I could have dreamed of; the battle that Godzilla 2014 so disappointed me by failing to really deliver. The atomic breath scene is amazing, and if you're able to stomach the unorthodox nature of the iconic breath attack, then I would go so far as to say that this scene blows anything from Godzilla 2014 out of the water in terms of demonstrating Godzilla's destructive power.\n\nThe weakest part of the movie, in my opinion, comes after the atomic breath scene. In this movie, Godzilla is heavily reliant on a cycle of overheating and cooling. After using his beam weapon, he goes into a state of hibernation for several weeks. During this time, the momentum of the movie slackens off quite a bit, and it was during this point (around 3/4 of the way through the movie) that I caught myself checking the time. This part of the movie consists mainly of our heroes organizing a secret plan to stop Godzilla once and for all, solving a mystery (which is resolved in an extremely arbitrary and overly cute way), and dealing with geopolitical forces beyond their control (more on this later). The action picks up again at the end, as the anti-Godzilla plan is put into action, but there's a definite gap between the movie's two different climaxes where you may find yourself fidgeting a bit.\n\nSo anyway, the geopolitics. This movie makes a point of Japan finding itself, essentially, being constantly pushed around by other countries. Mostly this means the United States, which injects itself into Japanese deliberations about how to deal with Godzilla more and more often as the film goes on. There's also a vaguely-sketched plot thread where China and Russia, acting in seemingly malevolent concert, conspire to further strip Japan of its sovereignty in an effort to impose an anti-Godzilla plan; this plan eventually results in a Ticking Timer against which are heroes are racing. If our heroes fail to defeat Godzilla before time is up, the immobile Godzilla, and the Tokyo cityscape surrounding him, will be destroyed with a nuclear bomb. While its easy to understand that the diplomatic maneuvering of other countries represents Japan's anxiety over being subject to international forces beyond its control, this part of the movie seemed to have been insufficiently elaborated upon. We mostly get the sense that the rest of the world is \"out to get Japan\", and that Japan has to make its own way in the world, but it's hard to understand why Russia and China in particular (the US is given at least some justification) are so eager to nuke Tokyo.\n\nSo that's the meat of the movie. Our heroes eventually succeed, and Godzilla is reduced to, basically, a petrified statue in downtown Tokyo. The infamous final shot of the film is still more-or-less inexplicable, although you could assume that the humanoid beings sprouting from Godzilla's petrified tail represent a narrowly-averted mass reproduction of new Godzilla organisms. In any event, it doesn't seem to contribute much to the film.\nThere's also some stuff worth commenting on around the edges: the music is mostly excellent, and its great to hear the reuse of some old scores and sound effects. The original soundtrack of the film is also strong, although there are a few musical cues that seem out of place (some sort of speed rock plays over shots of a chemical plant, I think, perhaps meaning to create levity out of the mismatch. I'm not sure). I'm not really equipped to judge the acting of the Japanese characters, but the attempts at speaking English are a bit awkward (though not so bad as some of the attempts made during the Heisei series).\n\nAll told, I enjoyed Shin Godzilla, but I wouldn't call it a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination. I'm not sure how, exactly, to rank it in terms of comparison to other Godzilla films, as there seems to be only a handful of films you can really compare it to. This is nothing like Ghidorah the Three-Headed monster, for example.\n\nIt's not quite as good as Godzilla 1954, anyway. That movie was much more raw in its symbolism and urgent in its message. Shin Godzilla definitely has things that it wants to say, but it lacks the sense you get from Godzilla 1954 of seeing a nation's fresh wounds lay bare. There's plenty of scenes of destruction in Shin Godzilla, but rarely does it match the depictions of death and suffering presented in the 1954 film. Shin Godzilla comes closer to the relatively bloodless (in human terms, anyway; Godzilla bleeds quite a bit) outings like Godzilla 1985 or Godzilla 2014. Comparing this film to the 2014 movie may seem a bit misguided, considering that 2014 is a versus film, but these are the two most recent Godzilla films, and both movies focus on trying to present a relatively grounded film that focuses on the various people out to stop the monsters' rampages.\n\nAs it stands now, I would give Shin Godzilla the edge over Godzilla 2014, simply because the characters of this film seem more active and engaged in the events of the film than Aaron Taylor Johnson's unfortunately lifeless protagonist of the 2014 film. Additionally, from a simple fanboy perspective, Shin Godzilla gave me the sorts of military clashes with Godzilla that 2014 was missing. Whether or not to put this movie over Godzilla 1985 is trickier; I will fess up to not having seen the Japanese cut of that film recently (I should probably look in to picking up the new stateside release thereof). \n\nSo, as things stand now, I would give Shin Godzilla a\n7/10, where I rank Godzilla 1954 a 10, Godzilla 1985 an 8, and Godzilla 2014 a 6. I liked parts of Shin Godzilla, but (and perhaps this will change on repeat viewings), parts of it just didn't \"click\" well enough for me to consider it an instant classic.", "I REALLY enjoyed it, a lot of the CGI was a lot better than i expected it to be but on top of that the cinematography was top notch.  \n\nYou really got the scale of Gojira itself and even in it's earliest forms it made sense.  I really hope that the Legendary Films Godzilla take a page from this one in terms of destruction and flow.  You could even tell that this film had the 2014 Godzilla look to it (especially when it's dark, flames reflecting off the camera and the destruction).  It was fantastic.\n\nOnly negative I'd say is other than the roars, and some military sounds (tanks, ect), a lot of the destruction sounded kind of quiet.  I'm not sure if that was intentional but if someone could shed some light on it that would be awesome.  When the 2014 Godzilla roared for the first time my theatre shook and I got chills down my spine.  That's all I have in terms of negativity though.\n\nVisually Godzilla looked fantastic, better CGI than I expected.  His colors changing looked fantastic and his plasma beams and fire breadth was terrifying.  When he leveled the entirety of that city my mouth was floored.\n\nOverall it's a definite see for Godzilla fans, and as an Anime fan I'll be watching Evangelion ASAP.\n\nEdit: Any ideas as to what was going on with it's tail at the end? We're those humans attached to it or any speculation as to what that was?", "As someone who has only seen the two American films, the original 1950s film, and this new one, what is generally regarded as the best Godzilla film?

Seriously, I have no problems with the movie whatsoever (that might change on another viewing), and love the callbacks to the other Godzilla movies (music, roars, etc).\n\n", "**Spoilers**\n\nI found it really interesting how this movie **has no characters**, at least from a traditional standpoint. No one had any connections outside of the government and the leads didn't have that much more screen time than the other government officials. Really, Japan as a whole was a character, vs Godzilla. Bureaucracy vs a mindless creature that \"just walks\". Man vs Nature, where an entire country, with politics and (lots of) meetings, stand for the Man part. Very interesting take. I liked it and it's a better option than having poorly defined characters.\n\nI thought the movie lost steam in the third act, but overall it was very energetic with surprisingly interesting camera work for a Toho Godzilla flick. \n\nThe new music was good and effective, although the guitar riff parts were a little overdone and cheesy. The source music from the '54 Gojira were cool from a nostalgic view but really I wish they would've used newer recordings for those tracks. Orchestral music recorded 60 years ago sounds so fragile.\n\nGodzilla's evolution / design were pretty amazing and I can't say I have any complaints. His final form was unique but still very Godzilla in design. The new powers were fantastic.\n\nI really loved the daytime military vs Godzilla scenes and I wish the American '14 Godzilla movie had more than just dark, night scenes. It's an incredible battle and very entertaining. The glowing of Godzilla at night was very well done as well.\n\nThe CGI was bad in a few places but I can't say I expected anything different. Godzilla himself looked strong throughout.\n\nThe Dental Surgery finally was a bit cookoo but fun and original. I loved the frozen Godzilla standing there.\n\nExcellent movie!", "It is something else, alright. Part serious and part humorous, and pretty successful with each of those things at different times. But does it all work together? Gosh, I don't know. But I was entertained and invested throughout, so that alone puts it ahead of the Gareth Edwards film from a couple years ago for me. It has a good energy to it, and I liked some of the story beats, and how the government tries to deal with the situation, and the humor of the bureaucracy involved.\n\nBut Godzilla himself... Um, wow. If the rest of the special effects and destruction footage wasn't generally very well done, I'd have said sure, make him cheap and cheesy looking. But whew. It's weirdly bad. When he makes his first big reveal, I'm not sure if it would have been worse if they showed Barney the dinosaur. I guess it may have been a style choice, but it feels more like they ran out of money or hired the wrong company to make the big guy. It gets better as he mutates, but still isn't especially great. There is one scene, though, where he retaliates after being attacked, and that is so so cool. That's more of a special effects thing, though, but still, he wins you over there, big time.", "My short take:  The stuff with Godzilla is great, but if you were mad at Godzilla (2014) for spending too much time on humans, you will hate it.\n\nI liked it but they could have easily cut 30 minutes of the boardroom crap and still made the same points.

The only likeable character, tom, turned out to be the villain in a shitty plot twist. \n\nThose must have been the worst detectives ever.

No, not really. \n\nIt's simply *okay*.\n\nLet's start with the positive for once. Even though the three main characters are over-the-top, batshit crazy, overly flawed, unrealistic, housewives I *at least* found them interesting enough to follow. Emily Blunt as Rachel in particular gives a pretty good performance and poor man's Jennifer Lawrence, Haley Bennett, does an admirable job as the supremely screwed up, yet sexy, Megan. Additionally, Tate Taylor's directing is serviceable as he does his best to go toe-to-toe with David Fincher stubbing it in the process and resulting in a poor imitation at his best, and a melodramatic, silly mess at his worst.    \n\n*The Girl on the Train* is the next big thriller, that just isn't thrilling. Its 1hr52 min runtime felt like a good, 2h30 min to me due to the poor pacing and narrative structure. The narrative unfolds in a groan-worthy manner, overencumbered with flashbacks and scenes told from many different points-of-view due to Rachel's blackouts from severe alcoholism. I understand what Tate Taylor was going for -- as Rachel fills in the gaps in her memory, the film does as well -- but instead, it feels disingenuous, and worst, sloppy. To make matters worst, the flashbacks lack all subtlety, cutting to \"1 YEAR BEFORE\", \"6 MONTHS BEFORE\", \"1 MONTH BEFORE\", etc. over and over again. This repetitious nature makes the whole experience drag *hard*. Additionally, while focusing on three well-developed main characters appears quite ambitious, jumping from viewpoint to viewpoint to cover similar ground time and time again certainly didn't help quicken the pace. That being said, slow movies don't bother me too much, as long as there is a competent, interesting story, and to me, the story was pretty solid and engaged me just enough to follow. However, it certainly bothered the too many guys complaining loudly to their significant others throughout the screening and the 10+ walkouts.\n\nWith all of this said, my main problem with *The Girl on the Train* isn't in the narrative structure or slow pace, it's in that the mystery doesn't result in a satisfying conclusion. As a whole, the film simply isn't clever. Sure, there are many twists and turns, and the story certainly goes to places that I wouldn't have initially guessed, but that's wherein the problems lie -- it likely isn't things that any viewer would have guessed or figured out as the film is very misleading, has copious red herrings, and keeps crucial information from the viewer to later reveal. This makes any twists/turns/reveals fall flat due to a feeling of being cheated; a sort of cinematic dishonesty and broken trust between the director and the viewing audience. \n\nThis results in *The Girl on the Train* often getting an \"Oh...okay then\" accompanied with an eye-roll, instead of an \"Ah-ha!\" with a smirk.  \n\nIs it worth watching? I guess if you have two hours to kill and nothing else better to do, sure, why not! I didn't hate or actively dislike the film, it just could have been better.

It's not as bad as many have made it out to be, but it's nowhere near as good as it could've been. Emily Blunt gives one of her best performances as Rachel and she's surprisingly very convincing as a depressed alcoholic. The rest of the cast is solid, especially Haley Bennett and Justin Theroux. The cinematography is also very striking and I really liked Danny Elfman's score as well. However, Erin Cressida Wilson's script is where my big issues lie. The storytelling is muddled and the mystery leads to a twist whose predictability ends up draining the film of any tension or suspense. It also quickly enters melodramatic territory at several points. Dialogue is either very well-written or incredibly poorly written. Tate Taylor's direction is also sorely lacking, a shame given that I really liked his work on The Help and Get On Up.", "Was not expecting the therapist to be Spanish and him yelling in Spanish to Megan was just so corny to me", "I thought it was a train crash.

Oh yeah then the father killed himself. That must be why Megan is constantly cheating. Why did she suddenly confide in the shrink after 10 years?

Gross inplications that the female character with the most on-screen sex scenes is the only one who gets killed. Reminds me of the \"slut dies first\" trend in horror movies. I felt they never really explained her sexual obsession either. Why would she have unprotected sex with someone else's husband if she hated the idea of having more kids??

I understand that women (and men) who are physically and emotionally abused are gas-lighted by their partners but the extent of this seemed pretty unbelievable? Are we to believe that she never once remembered his abuse and manipulative behavior even once? Not saying she would have had the strength to leave immediately but even just a memory? There's this crazy reveal in the book and movie where it's like \"Oh my god!! I remember now!! He's a total evil bastard.\" This felt like a thin plot point to me - anyone else?

Pretty much the mass hanging through the ending is extremely visceral and effective. Even little moments, for example the butler cutting Samuel's beard, utilize very tense and foreboding camerawork and sound design.\n\nThat said, and I rarely think this, I am having a lot of trouble separating the art from the artist on this one. That a pivotal scene was fabricated for this so-called true story sends a lot of mixed messages about Nate Parker as a storyteller. This introduces a bias throughout the film that makes its finale, though spectacular, a bit thematically questionable.\n\nI don't think this film does the slavery narrative any more justice than *12 Years a Slave* did three years ago.

Birth of Nation's hole card was it was supposed to be about their revenge, yet even Django Unchained was more satisfying in that regard.\n\nAlso, it really glosses over how many children were killed during the revolt (as in, it shows none). Not only were they killed, often times they were being explicitly targeted. I'm sure it was omitted because it makes it difficult to sympathize with a child killing protagonist. A better way to have handled it would be to just juxtapose the violence committed there during the 48 hours of the rebellion and juxtopose it to the generational violence being committed against the slaves instead of stacking the deck so much in their favor. The movie would have been better for asking such questions.\n", "I just want to know who thought it was a good idea at Fox to release a trailer during Monday Night Football that edited in pictures from Black Lives Matter protests?

We can't sugar coat slavery - it was ugly and disgusting.\n\nWhat I thought was \"eh\" was at times the movie went very slow, and the side story of vengeance on the slave catcher was obvious from the first scene, and so cliche.\n\nFrom a historical perspective- 12 Years a Slave is a better overall film and showcases slave life more accurately. With that being said, this film has a lot of merit and should be praised for bringing a story to light that needs to be told.", "Knowing all the controversy surrounding the film and its maker, I didn't want to read anything about it. I went in fairly uninformed knowing only the basic outline of the plot.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the film with reservations (more in a minute). I think it is a really good first film. Nate Parker shows he can act and direct. The performances all solid all around. Armie Hammer really showed some depth as Turner's friend/owner. Parker definitely gives you a lot to think about and wants to re-emphasize that this happened and we are still feeling the effects of it today. Slavery was one of the worst times in American history and he pulls no punches in showing the treatment of people during that time.\n\nSo here's where my reservations come in. The character of Turner is basically portrayed as a Christ-like figure with no demons or problems of his own. He seems like a flawless human being. Everyone has a flaw, no matter who they are. I also have a big problem with the eventual direction of the film. Turner is essentially pimped out to different plantations in order to spread a falsified word of God to the slaves. It's all about respecting your master and always listening to your master, and so on. Okay he's getting frustrated with how things are...good/effective. But the straw that broke the camel's back and causes this rebellion are two rapes: one on Turner's wife and on the wife of another slave. \n\nHaving done research after seeing the film, it seems that neither of the rapes actually occured. Which means Parker used it as a plot point in order to justify his rebellion. If the story were fiction, it would be an easy enough reason to get you on the side of the protagonist. But because this is \"based on a true story\", you're not allowed to do that just to make a point. And even though I enjoyed the direction, I could've done without the lame angelic effect of his wife just before his death. The wings were noticeably fake and it briefly took me out of what should've been a more powerful moment.\n\nI would recommend people seeing it. I think there's enough there to justify it. But I would also say keep an open mind and realize that it's Hollywood and there's more to the story than what's on the screen. 12 Years A Slave is a far more effective movie based on a similar subject", "Anyone else a little weirded out about a movie with a brutal gangrape directed by and starring a man accused of taking part in a gangrape?", "A question from someone who hasn't watched yet \n\nDoes the movie look all blue and Gray all the time?\n\nI watched the trailer and it looks very drab and\"Zack Snyder filter\"-ed", "The last shot gave me chills -- other than that, I thought it was terrible. Which sucks because I've been following it for well over a year and had really looked forward to it.", "Solid film. Very powerful and one my favorites of the year so far. However, I could've done without some of the visual metaphors (if someone can explain the older/younger Nat in the woods and the butterfly, please do) and the rebellion was rushed. Usually, I clamor for films to be shorter in length, but this one could have benefited from about 20 extra minutes toward the end. I mean, the rebellion did not really work. It got a ton of slaves killed. How did Nat react to that? Especially considering he thought the rebellion would lead to significant change. Also, I would have liked to have seen more development concerning Nat and Sam. Nat going from a preacher to someone killing people with axes was a bit abrupt. Sam going from being kind of levelheaded (for a slave owner, that is) to selling his women essentially/whipping slaves was abrupt as well. I don't agree with some of you claiming the inclusion of Cobb was \"cliche\" (I feel like this is a word people randomly throw around without explaining why they don't like something). Thought that was fine (people in my theater clapped when got killed). The \"Strange Fruit\" portion was powerful. Overall, B+/A-. Parker has a ton of talent.", "The direction here stuck out as really heavy handed and amateur; the angel, TV-esque framing, atrociously edited action", "[removed]", "Saw this at a screening about a week ago. Irrespective of the controversy surrounding the film, whether it's Parker himself or the actual act of making a film about Nat Turner, I don't think there's a good film here. At best, it is a mediocre telling of this story. At worst, it's sometimes offensively awful film, whether it's the way the violence towards women only seems to matter as it pertains to Turner's feelings or the weird homosexual coding of Samuel Turner. \n\nI think there's a great film to be made about Nat Turner, the problem is that it's not really evident here that Parker has any interest in telling that story. If Parker's goal is to teach us about who Nat Turner was and what he lived through, he has failed because I learned nothing about Turner nor did I find another perspective to look at him from. If Parker's goal was to incite a conversation about race, he hasn't done the work to make such a conversation illuminating and interesting. Even if Parker's goal was to inspire action over oppression, the results are doubtful because this is a wholly mediocre work of art. \n\nTurner is a complicated figure in history, as there are many perspectives to look at him from. Parker goes for the easiest version to tell, and it feels more like we're watching the story of Nate Parker versus Nat Turner's story. \n\nAdditionally, someone else I talked to said that the way this film uses religion as an incitement to violence was deeply troubling to them. Normally, religious themes in a film do not bother me. Here, I actually have to agree. There's a deep feeling of unironic fascistic revenge that even something like *Braveheart* never approaches. ", "I felt the film was in some ways pretty awful - a lot of the directing at the beginning was hamfisted, and some of the writing was as generic as generic could get - and in some ways incredible. Parker showed flashes of brilliance here and there, but also had moments of evident amateurism.\n\nThere were some threads that really resonated with me. The story arc of Samuel Turner was impressive - it's never stated, shown and not told, that his disgust with his fellow slave owners fueled his drinking problem, and when that manifested into full-on alcoholism, it made his character devolve into what he was formerly disgusted by. The film was strangely averse to showing true moments of cruelty you'd expect from something of this nature - but then the force-feeding scene captured a true feeling of dire hatred, to the point where it made me weep.\n\nAt the same time, the film never earns the storied reputation it received out of Sundance. Why did we see nearly an hour of Turner's preaching, yet the rebellion itself lasts just 15 minutes and culminates in a single two-minute brawl? Why was the fictionalized rape added into the film, when it only served to underscore the ugly gender dynamics evident throughout (Cherry is treated as a sexual object by the slavers bidding on her... only for her to be bought as a literal gift for Samuel's wife... and to be treated, up until their marriage, as a beautiful object Nat desperately wants to own)?\n\nI don't know how to feel about the film. At times it was truly powerful, and nearly made me break down another time post-climax. At others I found myself grinding my teeth or furious by its toothless or unnecessary depictions of scenes deserving a better treatment. Mostly, I'm finding myself questioning why we keep returning to these historical wells, here and Free State of Jones, where independent filmmakers attempt to tackle lesser-known moments of history, then dumb them down and overly simplify them to meet the standards of Oscar bait.", "The performances elevated this iffy script.  One of the few films based on historical events where the actual historical event could have punched up the film (and not the other way around).  The Nat Turner rebellion has enough material surrounding it that you could have crafted a Braveheart style epic/tragedy.   \n\nInstead you had a 5 minutes burst of rebellion/anger.  The rest of the film is spent meandering through southern plantation life, encounters with the slave patrol, and an in depth examination of the evolving living arrangements of the Turner family.  The film undersold how much of a panic slave revolts (Nat Turner's in particular) caused when they occurred.  You could have shown that panic, the back story of how the militia's and US Army were mustered to suppress the revolt, the hysteria that broke out after the rebellion was suppressed.  Once again, instead you get a 5 minute burst of rage, a few shots of blacks hanging from trees, and a overly romantic parting shot of black Union soldiers (the Civil War was 30 years after the Nat Turner rebellion, so a little more distant than the film would imply).  \n\nShame that they missed such a good opportunity to tell one of the lesser known (but important and interesting) stories from American history.  Nat Turner is a pretty unique American character (also more so than the film would have you believe).  I think the performances saved this in a lot of ways.  I wasn't particularly bored since the acting was really good.  It helped to distract from the iffiness of the film as a whole.  \n\nIn the end, I wouldn't say it's bad, just not particularly remarkable for me.  Disappointing given how great the history is.  ", "The RT consensus hits it right on the nose for me. A flawed film, but a powerful one nonetheless.\n\nThe ins and outs of daily plantation life have been shown in film plenty of times, and I think it was captured well here. As the other poster below mentioned, I really liked the arc of Samuel Turner: he drank because he was disgusted with the cruelty of the other slave owners, and his alcoholism drove him to be as cruel as the rest of them. The contrast between the beginning of the film where he was playing with Nat almost as an equal and the end was pretty stark. \n\nHowever, I think Parker could have made the film much better by showing the reflection of that same arc in Nat. The story of Nat Turner is as canonical an example as there is of the \"He Who Fights Monsters\" trope, and I don't think he explored that as well as he could have. I thought Nate did an excellent job overall in showing what drove Nat (jesus, typing these names is confusing) to the point of leading a rebellion, but not nearly enough of just how brutal that rebellion was. In other words, to borrow the phrasing of the trope, the film had plenty of fighting monsters, but not enough of becoming a monster himself. Rather, it chose to portray the slave rebellion in a purely heroic light, which I don't think does justice to just how morally complex (at least for me) a slave rebellion is. \n\nSlavery is evil, mass murder is evil. I realize this may be an unfair criticism, since I'm asking the film to be something that it isn't instead of judging it on its own terms, but I would have preferred to see that side of the rebellion: that the horror of slavery isn't enough to be evil on its own by holding millions in bondage, but that its evil is so pervasive that it drives otherwise good men to commit acts of evil in opposing it. For me, showing a slave rebellion in a positive light honestly does a disservice to just how much of an abomination slavery really is.\n\nOn something of a sidenote, and following from the previous paragraph, I think it's been harder for me to watch movies about slavery in the last few years, because they always result in me spending half the moving thinking about the extent to which the effects of slavery are still being felt today. So many of the problems facing our country even now, whether it be out-and-out racism, inner city crime, mass incarceration, fatherless homes, and on and on down the list, are still facing us now, directly or indirectly, because our founders wouldn't stand up against America's original sin. Slavery was an infection, and we let it fester for so long that the damage is still echoing through us a hundred years later, and every time I think about it at length I wonder if we'll ever fully heal. ", "Poorly done Oscar bait. ", "Are people actually being downvoted for enjoying the film? C'mon, guys..", "The movie was just okay. Good debut with potential. I think the low budget really hurt it from a technical standpoint. Lots of sound and color grading issues. The whole movie either looked like uncolored proxies or weird bleach bypass. It felt like a History Channel made-for-TV piece at times. I hope Nate Parker gets to make more movies with bigger budgets, though, because the moments that shine here really do shine.\n\nHaving said that, Birth of a Nation will get bogged down not only by Parker's own controversies but by the fact that its Oscar bait release is such an on-the-nose response to Oscars So White and Black Lives Matter. Fox Searchlight, desperate for a 2016 hit, paid $17.5 million (budget was only $10 million) for the next 12 Years a Slave and the next middle finger to white people. Instead, they got a middle-of-the-road period piece that won't make half of that back.\n\nHow this got such a huge response at Sundance is beyond me. How this was the biggest buy in Sundance history is also beyond me. No Oscar wins. Maybe no Oscar nominations.\n\nAnd to Nate Parker -- don't insist on an immediate wide release for your $10 million Sundance movie.

And I get that, with Parker's marred reputation, that sort of reactionary statement could be seen as me politicizing the filmmaker's personal life but I *assure you* this movie is just that awful. Admittedly it exudes passion, except Parker has no idea how to reign his obvious affection for the subject. Milquetoast when it needs to be subdued, stentorian when it needs to be powerful. In the hands of a more accomplished director, maybe the film's amorphous masses of coverage and short-reverse-shot could have resembled actual scenes, but it still doesn't make up for the hackneyed storytelling and the ham-fisted acting. Armie Hammer probably shouldn't be in things. \n\nFuck.", "Wow. Absolutely terrible film. Followed every single oscar bait cliche possible. They managed to make Nat Turner fucking boring. Incredible.", "The transition at the very end of the film from the young man into the older man that was fighting in the war was fantastic", "Thought it was pretty good, even really good but not great. It's a pretty conventional and almost bland way to tell this incredibly compelling story. It's really uncomfortable and shocking when it needs to be but doesn't overdo it. It did a great job of putting you into the mindset and position of a slave and making you feel stuck and the hopelessness of the situation. Especially those few scenes where he has to preach to those slaves who have been horribly abused - and he can't do *shit*. Those were the most effective scenes for me.\n\nThere's also some great humor and levity. While I liked 12 Years a Slave more than this, Birth of a Nation is definitely more of a well-rounded film in that it has more emotional range - even if the subject of slavery is done more justice in the former.\n\nI particularly liked the turn of Armie Hammer's character, who at first seemed like a \"decent\" dude but you soon realized that even though he might \"like\" Turner, his success and stature was more important. Seeing him get what was coming to him was satisfying.\n\nMy biggest problem with the film - and what I'd like to hear others' thoughts on - is I felt it didn't really have a point of view or message. Was what Nat Turner did right? Was there a different way he should have gone about things? How do the events of this film apply to today? I'm incredibly sympathetic towards the slave rebellion and the violence (and I think the film is too), but there's an interesting moral dilemma there that I don't think the film really explored.", "I saw the movie in order to preview it for possibly taking my history classes to see the film. Although I mostly enjoyed Birth of a Nation it suffers some big holes in both storytelling and historical accuracy. \n\nThe script was very generic but, as others have said, the performances were quite excellent. Pacing was a bit of a problem though. I didn't like that the film went to such lengths to establish Nat as being a good guy with his higher degree of education, nice family, love of his life, etc and then omitting the brutal murder of white children during the rebellion. Painting a one-sided martyrs versus murderers reminds me of another [Birth of a Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation).\n\nThe theater I saw it at was mostly filled by African-Americans and I (a white guy) found it interesting the reactions to the film at certain points. For example there was some laughter during the beating of Jethro and the killing of the slave owner that did the teeth thing. I guess I just found myself in an unfamiliar position of being surrounded by people that were glad to see the on-screen murder of white guys. \n\nI ultimately decided I won't be taking my class to see Birth of a Nation as there are better, more accurate films that teach the same content (12 Years a Slave being the best) but will let interested students know  that this is out there as well.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I almost forgot, my favorite aspect of the film was seeing the relationship between Nat and Samuel. I thought there was some dimensionality with Samuel in struggling to keep the plantation going but also recognizing that ~~many~~ (all?) slave owners were very cruel.", "Its the \"Passion of the Christ\" of slave movies. Take that as good or bad. ", "Personally, I thought it was fantastic. I hate to see that it isn't getting quite as much love as expected. There were definitely a couple of amateur moments (angel during Turner's death, the awkwardly speedy coming/going of Turner's father, etc.), but I chalk that up to this being Parker's first time writing/directing, and for the most part, I found the film to be extremely powerful, well-acted, and well-directed. I do wish it was longer, though. I felt that the end was somewhat rushed (although I am aware that the rebellion only lasted around 2 days).

I had no idea of what had really happened; I remember seeing footage of the fire on the news, and of course constant talk about the BP Oil Spill that followed.

It's a heartbreaking story.\n\nMy friend had one complaint, and that was that she thought it should have/would cover the environmental disaster that followed. I disagree; that is an important story, and one that can and should be covered elsewhere, but the human element of this story is a massive one and they deserve to have their stories told.

It's a very realistic and humanizing film.", "I went in randomly without watching any trailers or commercials. Have to say, it was really well done! One of my buddies who works at the Alberta Rigs told me there were a lot things captured on film which felt familiar to his work setting.", "Some might feel the film takes too long to get to the disaster, but for me that extended period of time waiting for the crap to hit the fan just made it so much more tense. When the crap does hit the fan the technical execution of it is stellar. One of my faves of the year so far. ", "I have worked offshore for the past 9 years and I went back and forth on wether or both I wanted to see this.  I figured that it would be politically driven and would be made to shine a negative light on the industry as a whole.  I'm really glad that I went.  I can't speak on the accuracy of what happened in the drill house (I'm on the production side and never deal with a company man), but they did an incredible job of capturing the crew change/downtime on the platform.  \n\nIt really made things hit closer to home by seeing the crew use the real locations.  I've flown out of Bristow (which was Air Logistics during the explosion) countless times, fueled up at Moran's Marina in Fourchon, and spent many a crew change nights enjoying one last beer at the bar in the Crowne Plaza.  \n\nAll in all, I really appreciated the effort that was put into this.  It did more to remind me of how dangerous things can turn, than any safety meeting ever will.\n\n\n\n", "For me, the standout performance in the film was definitely Kurt Russell.

Malkovich a close second.\n\nThe pacing of the film was incredible, honestly felt like it went by so fast, it did not drag in any way and felt just like watching in real time.\n\nThe absolute best feature of this movie was how it built tension in the first act and kept you waiting for the shit to hit the fan. Great choice of sound effects and soundtrack, as well as underwater shots.\n\nAnother amazing thing was the realism in dealing with injuries, human character and friendship among coworkers.\nPersonally, I would rank it as the second best film I saw this year, second only to Everybody Wants Some!! Maybe it'll get some love at the technical Academy Awards.\n\nPS. Saw it in 4DX and it was an insane experience, highly recommended!", "I definitely liked it.

By the end I wanted someone ANYONE to punch the BP guys hard in the face. Highly recommend it.", "Just saw the movie and really enjoyed it. I felt like it didn't dramatize the events too much (as far as big Hollywood films go, of course) - there were moments where I was expecting something hokey and dramatic around the corner and they chose to go the more realistic route, which I appreciated.  \n\nThe movie was also really great at making me feel the impact of what was happening to the people on that rig - the shock and the trauma and horror.   \n\nI loved the editing for the most part - especially after the fire broke out, I think they didn't a good job of cutting scenes together to make sense of the progression of the fire and the explosion. For the people-based action scenes, some of the cutting happened too quickly and it was hard to get a sense of direction with regards to who was where and where they were going, but in terms of pace it was still great. At very few points during the movie did I feel like it was lagging. \n\nAbsolute favourite scene, by far, was the ones near the beginning with Kurt Russell facing down a boardroom full of BP managers. Him and John Malkovich were spectacular. I'm probably going to go see that movie again just to see that scene through once more. \n\nSmall rant: most of the people at the theatre tonight start leaving as soon as the news clips at the end started showing, and those that stayed through those mostly left when they started showing the names of the eleven men that died. I know it's just a movie, but something about that felt so disrespectful or disdainful. I don't know, maybe I'm being too sentimental. ", "Really enjoyed this movie. Kurt Russell, John Malkovich and Wahlberg kill it. Great directing by Berg. Wasn't expecting it to be this thrilling. \n\n8/10 ", "My thoughts copied from the General Discussion thread yesterday:   \n\nWent into this armed with nothing more than a layperson's general understanding of its subject matter, the knowledge that it starred Mark Wahlberg and had a solid Rotten Tomatoes score, and a little bit of skepticism that it would come off as somewhat exploitative given the recency of its events. Although the general message is laid on fairly thick at times, and it isn't without some expected 'hero movie' cliches, overall I came away very impressed and would give this movie a solid recommendation. I always enjoy Wahlberg, but the rest of the cast was on point as well.  Discovering that Kurt Russell and John Malkovich were co-stars was a real treat (yes, I know their names are right there on the poster and the actors themselves probably appear in the trailers also, but I hadn't taken more than a cursory glance at the former and I hadn't seen the latter). As one would expect, their performances were excellent.  \n\nFrom a technical standpoint, I would go so far as to say this movie is spectacular. Seeing it in IMAX, I was simply blown away by its visual scope, sound and set design. The major set-pieces feel very genuine and not overly CGI'd, and overall they were as impressive and pulse-pounding to me as anything I've seen from the likes of James Cameron and Ron Howard. It certainly delivers on its big budget, and it would not surprise me at all to see it up for some technical hardware during awards season. \n\nI also found the narrative to be fairly taut and well-paced, sufficiently explaining the necessary technical points without dwelling on them excessively, and building effectively to the climax such that I found myself totally absorbed in the movie once the pace began to pick up. The foreshadowing of the disaster to come isn't subtle at all, but we already know what happens anyway, so this is something I can forgive. The whole film clocks in at just under two hours as well, which I appreciated in an era when it feels like this kind of dramatic action picture almost always ends up at 135+ minutes. Another version of this movie might have been longer if it included an examination on the residual fallout of the spill, but that kind of coda would have felt somewhat at odds with the rest of the film's singular focus on this precipitating event and the individuals involved in it. I appreciate the filmmakers' decision to preserve the movie's identity in that way, and leave it to others to explore the other, broader aspects of the overall crisis. \n\nI've seen some comments on here expressing apprehension that this movie would focus too much on the tough guys involved and end up letting BP off the hook, and that certainly isn't the case. They are unequivocally portrayed as greedy and negligent and the root cause of the spill, and the general effect on me as I left the theater was a mixture of sadness for the families of those who lost their lives and anger that such a tragic and environmentally disastrous event could probably have been avoided if not for some terrible decision-making. I appreciated the tribute they paid to the deceased at the end of the film, showing their photographs one by one to reinforce that these were real people with lives and families, not just names on a list. I thought it was very touching.  \n\nMy initial general reaction, having only just seen it this afternoon, is that this is one of the better movies I've seen this year, and definitely something I would care to watch again.  \n\n**TL;DR:** Solid cast, compelling narrative, immense and impressive action, and appropriately emotional and thought-provoking without coming off as exploitative. I really enjoyed this movie would definitely recommend it. ", "I thought it was a really good movie, but I felt like it ended too quickly after they got off Deepwater Horizon. Could have used another 10 minutes or so to wrap things up I think. Specifically about the consequences of the actual oil spill itself.", "Saw this Thursday night and was looking for the discussion here but didn't see anything until just now.\n\nThis movie was fantastic! I completely wrote this movie off when I started seeing posters a few months ago because I figured it'd just be another disaster exploitation film starring Wahlberg as another blue collar hero. Then I saw the RT averages coming in and a lot of critics I respect wrote some glowing reviews.\n\nIt completely blew away my expectations, and a big part of that was how they were able to capture the human drama and characters involved in the movie. \n\nI had spent a lot of time in this area right after the disaster and the emotions were very high. But the people of the gulf coast of LA - and I don't mean this in the slightest way to sound condescending - are such wonderful people with such an amazing connection to their region. \n\nAnd this movie just did an incredible job of capturing that character in all of the portrayals. Wahlberg and Kurt Russell were standouts but Malkovich was absolutely amazing. I would have NEVER imagined he was not from that region, because he captured that character so perfectly.\n\nFinally the effects were so well done. The scale of the disaster was captured so well. And the emotional, personal cost of the disaster was handled so beautifully. I walked out full of emotions, sadness, anger ... just a fantastic job all around.", "This is going to sound dramatic but I have never felt such dread in a movie theater before. The part when the woman was sending maydays and then she walks outside and the entire rig explodes I felt nauseous. I put my hands on my face and I leaned over.

I especially liked his scenes with Kate Hudson; their chemistry together is fantastic. Wonderfully shot too.", "It's really weird to say it for a movie of this budget level ... but this is kind of a sleeper hit.  \n\nI think that most audiences will look at the trailer / poster and think \"I know all about that, I saw it on the news.\"  I was definitely one of those people.  But I needed to fill time after work last night, bought and ticket ... and was blow away. \n\nI honestly had no idea how complex this story was.  There's so much going on here - people's relationship to the planet, our over reliance on technology, and the exploitation of the worker bees by the suits ... this thing packs a wallop.  Not just thrilling - it was bizarrely thought provoking. \n\nThis is going to sound crazy but: after watching this movie, I actually started to understand the populist engine driving Trump's campaign.  I don't 100% get it, and I'm certainly never going to support the man ... but this made me understand where working class voters are coming from in their rage at being treated like disposable diapers by the rich and powerful.  \n\nAnyway ... I'd advise anyone to see this movie.  I think it's really worth it.  ", "I was thoroughly impressed by this film.

How does the movie handle that issue?", "Copying my thoughts from my post Thursday night.\n\nI see 2 movies already stickied but no discussion for this movie.

It reminded me a lot of Volcano and Dante's Peak (but mostly Backdraft because of Kurt Russel).\n\nThe ending got to me, it definitely felt like I went through the events with Mark's character and I cried, I actually think the last movie of this type to make me do that was Backdraft.....\n\nBut I really enjoyed it, and holly hell that first explosion was insane!\n\nOne last thing, coming from 4 years on a Submarine in the Navy, it really frustrated me that they never sounded an alarm, I know they said it in the beginning, but it really pissed me off.\n\n", "Just left the movie.

Tell me if I'm correct in these series of events\n\n1)Jacob and his father go to Wales in the Summer of 2016\n\n2)The children leave the home for children to go to the loop taking place on the pier in January 2016 (six months earlier than Jacob's real-time)\n\n3)After defeating the Wights, the children and Miss Peregrine leave for 1943 to search for a new loop, while Jacob STAYS in 2016(JANUARY 2016)\n\n4) Jacob is back in Florida, his grandpa alive, because Mr. Barron never killed him in that timeline. Now, I assume this is still January, because Jacob says his birthday isn't for a few months.\n\nMy question is: How did Jacob get back to Florida?", "Sadly, Burton completely shit on the book series. I knew it was going to be bad when he switched Emma and Olive but, Jesus Christ. Nothing about the movie was like any of the books and completely miss all of the main plot points. Why can't people just make movies as close to the original stories as possible instead of making pieces of shit?", "If you liked the movie you'll love the books.\nIf you liked the book you may hate the movie.\nParents please note this isn't really a kid\u2019s movie. Young kids might get scared because of the hollows. In my theatre a few kids started crying and had to leave.\nSPOILERS BELOW\nI can understand the need to change a few things, for example how they changed Jakes friend to a woman from work driving him home, that's not really necessary to drive the plot along. But instead those involved seemed to completely disregard the adventure Ransom Riggs wrote over several novels in lieu of a quicker more action packed ending in two hours.\nThe whole Emma/ Jake love story was way overplayed. Emma is 88, so I don't know why they made her such a love struck sad young woman. Emma is a strong character and a huge part of that is her fire ability so by making her more \u201cpoetic\u201d (as Burton mentioned) with the air ability you\u2019ve made her weak and reliant on others to help her. And Horace projecting his premonitions of their love was unnecessary. While there is love in the books Jake has other motives driving him and the other peculiars on their journey to save Miss Peregrine. Based on the movie ending I feel they\u2019ve made it into a love story. \nAnd the whole Enoch/ Olive relationship was silly too. It seems they wanted to give the audience more of a reason to see Enoch as aggressive towards Jake so by making Olive older it created jealousy. \nChanging the ages of the characters didn't make sense. If the kids were amazing actors like the Stranger Things kids, okay I get it. But they weren't, sorry but they weren't. Olive should have been younger Emma should have had the fire power and Bronwyn should have been Emma and Jakes age (physically). It seems she was just made younger so it would be more shocking she was so strong. To me that makes it seem like the audience needs to be force fed how amazing her peculiarity is. I will say, Hugh, Millard, Horace and Claire were perfect.\nAnd Fiona doesn\u2019t talk. Ever. She suffered from PTSD from something that previously happened before joining that loop. Every time she talked I got more and more frustrated. That\u2019s what made Fiona such an interesting character. She was kind, helpful but so hurt and broken. I felt her and Olive were the innocence of the series even though realistically they were in their 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\nEva green was great, not what I expected but I was really happy with her portrayal none the less. Let\u2019s note though it\u2019s mentioned if a Ymbryne is hurt it cannot return to her original form. So I don\u2019t understand even though she was hurt- they even show her in pain with her arm- how could she switch back? For me it just didn\u2019t work.\nThe twins were never in the books, just their photographs, again something added just for effect. \nI didn\u2019t mind the Samuel L. Jackson \u201caddition\u201d even though it wasn\u2019t really an addition. For those who haven\u2019t read the books it makes it that much more shocking that he can shape shift into other people (and as told in the books has done since Jake was a child to watch him). As mentioned by another commenter they did screw up with the whole contacts thing when Baron becomes Jake.\n\nAbe being alive was the most infuriating thing of it all though. You can\u2019t change time. You can\u2019t bring people back. That was a hard thing for Jake to face but it was never even brought up in the novels of him wanting to save Abe. He died, it was very sad but it happened. There was never going to be any way to go back and undo it so again I\u2019m left questioning why the writers felt the need to make such a drastic change to the story. \nLike many mentioned the last half of the movie fell short. For me this was because they were just making it up as they went along. None of that ever happens in the book so of course it didn\u2019t fit with the tone of the original source material. \nI\u2019m very disappointed the writers and those involved who chose to write their own ending to avoid any sort of cliffhanger or need to continue the story. There can\u2019t really be another movie. This is it. What took the peculiars three novels and many adventures to do (save Miss P) you\u2019ve done in one movie. To me that\u2019s what makes the books so wonderful. After you finish the first one you\u2019re anxious to start the next because Miss Peregrine is still gone and the peculiars need to save her. I know I\u2019m being overly picky but I\u2019ve been following the series since it started five years ago so I\u2019m hurt and a little offended they did this to Ransom and his readers. This doesn\u2019t feel respectful of his work to me. They took his characters and did what they thought mainstream audiences would want and to make quick money by using Tim Burton\u2019s name. Very upsetting as a fan of both of them. But again, it is just a movie!", "I went for this expecting it to be a good fantasy film, something like a dark Harry Potter. But alas it was nothing of the sort. The movie starts off well,  has an interesting premise and good visuals, but that's about all that's good. Once they reach the island very little about the movie was likeable. There are so many non-sensical/improbable things about the plot and characters; not much time is spent exploring the 'peculiar' characters; didn't find the acting all that good or believable; the shift in the movie's tone in the latter part of the film felt a little contradictory; the sudden uptick in the main characters ability and drive was unforeseen and out of sync with what precedes it;....I could go on.\n\nIt's a movie targeted at kids and adults; and kids will mostly enjoy it, but don't think any serious adult movie fan would rate it highly. 5.5/10", "This is another example of Tim Burton being given a great story to work with to end with him disregarding the source material to just make his own mediocre story.", "Anyone else annoyed they switched Emma and Olive?

Never read the books, but I'll be picking them up tomorrow! Seems like a nice mash up of harry potter/x-men/doctor who/series of unfortunate events. I feel like the main faults are trying to condense a WHOLE LOT of lore and character development into the run time while making it accessible to general audiences. Also, it kind of veers from being a creepy monster movie touching on some seriously dark material to \"oh wait this is a kids movie\", but I can't really fault it too much for that.\n\nOverall, very enjoyable and certainly makes me interested to see where the story goes!

But yeah, it was pretty inconsistent and my reasons for liking it are pretty personal. The ending didn't make sense-- I'm not really sure what happened? Are they not in a loop anymore? Why is no one questioning this creepy rusted boat going around? Why did Asa Butterfield leave at all if he was just gonna go right back? \n\nBut somehow, it was an entertaining movie.

I mean, don't get me wrong, the book had its own issues but for me personally the creative liberties Burton took for the film made it ten times worse. \n\nThe entire first two acts of the movie was a complete drag that devolves into a completely nonsensical final act that never existed at all in the books. Seriously, every conversation in the first two acts was filled with exposition to develop the world, but the characters and their motives go almost completely undeveloped. It feels like Burton basically took the premise of the book, chopped off the second half of the book and produced a gigantic amalgamation of all things Burton that just ultimately feels hollow and uninspired. Even Eva Green seemed to be going through the motions for much of this movie, and I absolutely adore her. \n\nMuch of the plot in film form makes absolutely no sense. The bad guys in the book were at least layered and had clear motivations. In the movie there are two baddies: Level 1 Bad Guy, and Level 2 Bad Guys: Samuel L. Jackson and his cronies. To make matters worse, the Level 2 bad guys apparently can't even see the Level 1 bad guys but apparently walk around with them and feed them eyeballs? And don't even get me started on the ending which is just as nonsensical as the entire third act. \n\nIt was a real mess. My nephew (10 years old) enjoyed it, and I suppose I enjoyed the promise the movie held but truth be told it goes largely undelivered. ", "Almost shat myself when the twins took off their masks. Holy Christ, their faces were creeeeeepy.", "I really enjoyed it. Sure there were a lot of changes from the book, but in every adaptation there's that choice of doing what works for a good adaptation or doing what works for a good movie. Burton chose doing what works for a good movie. And it did work. It was fun. It was scary. It was very different to most of Burton's other films. It was really enjoyable as a standalone fantasy film. ", "I never liked any other Tim Burtons films. None of them. It was a combination of what looked like someone tripping on acid and a art students final project from the animation style. I know people love it but his shtick never caught my eye. I almost didn't watch this because of his name. Almost. \n\nI'm glad I did though cause this was one of the best movies I've seen in years. No it isn't as good as star wars or Captain America because those exist in separate categories. Like Roger Ebert use to say. It is however greater than that recent xmen film travesty. This movie was new, engaging, and lighthearted enough with a serious tone. Think MASH, with its comedy amidst the Vietnam War. \n\nThe difference between the first and second act is glaring. It goes from a lighthearted adventure to a hero vs villain fight, the underdog to a bully. It feels a little like switching genres and under a different director it might have gone more smoothly but I don't think the rest of the film would have benefited from it  Tim Burton was still the better choice.  \n\nThe first act is weird, like it's supposed to be. The kid discovers a world full of peculiar children. Everything should look weird to him, and us. That's what's great about the first act. It marvels in Tim Burtons creepy and dark style. While it changes genres in the second act we don't lose that Burton creepiness, like the scene on the pier, but like I mentioned earlier it feels almost different. \n\nMy one complaint is a glaringly sorry thread being dropped. Our protagonists doesn't have a stellar relationship with his parents but instead he shares many memories with his grandfather. During our protagonists journey we see glimpses of his father's inability to function like a parent. There isn't enough of the mother to warrant her inclusion here. What we have the father is enough to see how strained the relationship between the two of them is. \n\nOur heroes journey is one shared many times. A loner, shy, adolescent boy who could barely talk to a girl grows up over the course of the film and  gets the girl. During that he needs a heart to heart with his father, or a different family member. I liked the humor in the script showing the father can't communicate with his son but at the end before our guy gets the girl we should have seen something between our hero and his father. Do they grow closer? Does the father wonder what happened with his son? Does he wonder why he suddenly walks like he saved the world?\n\nI'm not saying his father needs to be better in the end. I'm saying the whole subplot with his father just vanished at the end. Nothing came of it. Nothing. ", "It was a good movie in and of itself, but not a great adaptation of the book.

Why are the loops called loops instead of nests, the creators and gaudians of the loops are bird people, they pick a safe spot for the loop and work tirelessly to maintain it. Not to mention that the loops are specifically designed to protect children. I just think nest would be a better name\n\n2. What is so special about Jacob? I mean, he can see the hollows but, like, is that it? From my understanding the hollows were created by Mr Barron, so Jacob has the ability to see monsters that shouldn't technically exist. So if Jacob does his job and hunts down all of the hollows like he should, then won't he just be a regular kid, like, all that's special about him will be his ability to see monsters that don't exist, and the ability to enter time loops. Its sort of dumb. It like being the only one who can ride unicorns, but you're in a world were unicorns don't exist. I just think there should be a little bit more to his ability than just being able to see accidental monsters", "Wish I could loop back two hours and not have watched this movie", "It's lesser Tim Burton, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit.

Jackson was so damn fun to watch. I don't know about the rest of you, but I could watch him chew scenery (and children's gouged out eyeballs from a ball) for hours.

It was a lot more serious than I expected, especially with the trailers being so action heavy and focusing on the one liners a bit. The seriousness was a good thing however, as it separated this from your run of the mill PG-13 action movie and made it a movie you can take seriously with an actual story to tell.

Neither side has much of a sense of urgency to their problem. In the original, both the townsfolk and the bandits are fighting over food. It is literally life or death. The stakes here just seem... Eh.\n\nFurthermore, having Washington out avenge his family defeats the purpose of his character. He supposed to do it because it's the right thing to do. Not revenge. And the rest could care less. They do it for the adventure, or the challenge, to lay low, or just because they are hungry. There isn't a lot of nobility in the seven.\n\nAll in all, the movie is a mess. Awkward old-timey dialogue that sounds flat and forced. You can almost forgive Pratts abysmal performance. Until you see him next to Denzel who at least seems to be trying. And easy mistakes to avoid, like an Irish Catholic priest in a white bread western town, or a Gatling gun firing into the town from what appears to be the next county over. \n\nIt's a shame, because I thought there were several fine performances.

A story that's been told a hundred times before. A standoff in a mining town. Mexicans, Indians, references to the Civil War. Every textbook element of a Good Western is here.\n\nFor the most part, the cast does a great job:\n\nDenzel Washington plays the leader well, his natural charisma always on-spot in every scene. His appearance feels like a direct reference to Fred Williamson's cowboy blaxploitation efforts.\n\nThree of the other leads in the ensemble (Ethan Hawke as a conflicted Confederate sharpshooter, Vincent D'Onofrio playing a violent bear of a man whom quotes scripture, and Martin Sensmeier as a sort of Ronin Comanche) fill out the cast with solid story arcs and good acting wherein the rest either Just Meet Expectations or...in one actor's part...fall a bit short.\n\nThat actor is Chris Pratt. Though I can see his charms, his role felt a bit too forced, a bit too quippy and cartoonish for the movie. He's constantly bouncing between being goofy/affable and a fighter... At only one moment does he get serious and you get to see the Bad Guy he really is...then that side of his character never comes back again.\n\nI liked The Magnificent Seven.

In fact, I actually liked it better than the 1960 film.\n\n*The Magnificent Seven* accomplished two things that I imagine are rather challenging for a film like this:\n\n1) Even though it has a big cast of title characters, each of the Seven was given a decent amount of screen time, and they all got a chance to be bad ass.  Vasquez's character was bare-bones, and Red Harvest's personality was nonexistent, but overall the Seven were entertaining enough.\n\n2) The film was about 2.5 hours long, but it didn't feel that long.  I thought it was entertaining from beginning to end.  The action sequences were spaced quite nicely.  And each of the conversation scenes were fun thanks to a pretty funny script.\n\nI only have a couple of gripes, and they're both minor.  First, character motivation was really thin.  It made sense for Chisum to want to help the townsfolk.  I guess Horne, Goodnight, and Billy Rocks' reasons for being there made sense, too.  But Faraday, Red Harvest, and Vasquez didn't make sense.  Vasquez, especially, had very little reason to risk his life for these people.\n\nI also thought that the film's utter lack of racial tension was both funny and a little distracting.  Goodnight Robicheaux was a legendary Confederate sharpshooter, yet one of his best friends is a black dude, and the other is an Oriental?  Goodnight is a really progressive thinker for a 19th Century Cajun.  Also, Jack Horne was a famous Indian killer, but he had a strange fondness for Red Harvest.  Go figure.\n\nAlso, the sound track was forgettable.  Other than the classic *Magnificent Seven* theme song, I don't remember any of the music from the movie, and I just finished watching is an hour ago.\n\nOverall, fun movie.  It may not be saying much, but it's one of the best remakes I've seen.", "Awesome movie.

Not a lot of narrative to follow, no twists and turns/double crosses, just good straight forward action movie.\n\nI would have liked to see some more of Goodnight's PTSD featured, as i think it would play off as almost cowardice why he did not pull the trigger on the runner and left the group to some people.  Pratt's character was okay, but I've been marathoning Parks and Recreation the last week, so I saw Andy every time he was on the screen.  Red Harvest could have had a better reason to join the crew, and his \"showdown\" with the Bogue's Native seemed a bit anticlimatic, but seemed more authentic that way.\n\nGoodnight and Billy's death was anticlimatic, but that is how it is.  Not everyone goes down in a blaze of glory.  Every fight does not go on for 10-15 minutes and have some moves that defy gravity.  Having Farraday survive 5-6 rounds really pushed the realm of belief for me, but it gave the second lead his moment.  \n\nOverall, I'd recommend it, and have.

It has completely different characters and it's just idiotic to bash it because it either is too much like the original or not enough like the original. It's a solid western that has a few flaws. There's too many lulls in the beginning (I seriously felt like we spent 20 minutes getting Denzel to join up with Pratt when it only took 3 seconds for it to actually happen).  The Indian and the Mexican practically have zero back story and the Indian's search for purpose is resolved but not talked about. DaNoff starts talking about having a family and then nothing. So did they die or leave or what, did I miss something? Can we just let him talk more? Bang that woman? Give him more scenes! Billy also didn't get much back story, but him and Goodnight were the most interesting characters in the movie who had enough there for a spinoff movie of their own. Instead the movie focuses on Chris Pratt, but his character is just a drunk gambler who flirts with girls. That's it. He's a prick. Why is it so focused on him when there's a bunch of other dudes more worthy of screen time? Denzel's great and his revenge story would've been better if it didn't seem so tacked on. I was like \"Is he just pulling this out of his ass?\".  Was there a lot left on the editing floor? I mean it's a good time. It's not bad. I like it. I would recommend it for sure.

I went with a friend who had seen neither film, so he was oblivious to what it would entail. It was a fun film but I have a few qualms about it.\n\n I felt the characters were compelling in their own way for the most part, especially Goodnight and Chisholm. There was a good chemistry between actors and characters I thought throughout the film. I really was not sure why Red Harvest even joined, I thought Chisholm's speech was not enough to convince him to help out the village. His parts were limited to just sniping from rooftops with his bow and a quip here or there.  I did like the interactions between the characters, it felt very genuine and natural, including a lot of the comedic relief parts. \n\nLike, another said, I was disappointed with how a few of them died. Even some of the antagonist death scenes seemed sub par, Red Harvest's little \"deadly scuffle\" with whoever the hell Bogue's Native American minion was anti-climatic, and the Goodnight-Billy duo was wiped out in a fashion that seemed dishonoring to their types. \n\nAnother thing was the lack of any type of presence from the villain Bart Bogue. There's hints to why Chisholm suddenly picks up the interest in helping and some dramatic scenes of him outright murdering a citizen for mouthing off, and him giving some spout about how Rose Creek will be nothing in the history books. He was evil for the sake of being evil and not so much as a motivation other than gold. \n\nThe original had some good motivations, not as good as Seven Samurai, but good enough for seven gunmen to join together. They were down in the squalors looking for work as the age of the gunslinger was trundling to a close, this seemed like the best way to end their careers before \"retiring\". I have a hard time believing the new characters had motivations when it seemed like they had an okay life. Vasquez may have had a good reason to do so but the rest is hard to think about, especially Jack Horne. \n\nI enjoyed it for the most part. \n\n6.5/10", "I'm honestly surprised at all the positive reviews..

Nick Cage was in this?", "While I firmly believe *Citizenfour* is a better film and does a better job of telling the story, I think *Snowden* excels in one area in particular: emotionally connecting the audience with the story.\n\nJames Cameron has said that he originally set out to make a documentary about the Titanic. But in the process, he realized that his audience would not be able to comprehend the immense tragedy of the event because they would have no way of emotionally connecting to it. It's very difficult for the average person to emotionally connect with an abstract concept such as \"the sinking of the Titanic\". So instead he chose to make it a love story, because he knew it would allow his audience to become emotionally connected to Jack and Rose, and therefore allow them to truly feel the immense tragedy of the event.\n\nI believe something similar has happened with this film. Yes, it's a bit cheesy at times, and Nicolas Cage's appearance is weird. But what it does do is allow the average American to have an emotional reaction and a true understanding of the consequences of mass surveillance. I feel like I had an emotional reaction when this story first leaked back in June 2013. But I know a lot of people who did not. I know a lot of people who, I feel like they just didn't really get how big of a deal mass surveillance was, and how much it could impact their lives.\n\nIn this film, we saw individual people be impacted by these spying programs. People we had grown to become emotionally invested in throughout the course of the film. We saw middle eastern people get bombed who may or may not have been the targets they were searching for. We saw Ed and Lindsay have sex while their webcam may or may not have been watching them. And we saw Corbin inform Ed that his girlfriend was being watched in great enough detail for him to know she was not cheating on him.\n\nNow, the whole story surrounding Ed's girlfriend is complete artistic liberty, because AFAIK, we know very little about Ed and Lindsay's relationship. I highly doubt most of what this film portrays to be true about their relationship, but I found myself feeling okay with that, because I saw what purpose it served.

And also package it nicely for a release in the middle of election season to hopefully re-spark this debate.  \n\nSo was it mission accomplished?

Not that it was Stone's purpose but if you're looking for this film to be an espionage thriller, it doesn't quite connect. However, I still really enjoyed the movie. The cast did a terrific job and even if the story was vanilla for people who know a bit about Snowden, it still did a good job telling his story to audience members who are a bit unaware of his situation (like the people I went with). Me, I prefer CitizenFour but the friends I went with were like wow I didn't realize Snowden did all that or the government did all this etc. \n\nThe film serves a purpose and I think it succeeded.

But I think it handles the story as well as it can.\n\nYes, Citizenfour is a far superior film.  But Snowden is accessible and simplifies some of the very complex issues that the real Edward Snowden raised.\n\nI have had mixed feelings about what Snowden has done but I think I've now come down on the his side. \n\nWhen Oliver Stone restrains himself a bit, which he does here, he is a unique and important storyteller.  Gordon-Levitt and Ifans are very good, the weakest link is Woodley - but she also has the most standard role of the girlfriend and not much that you can do when you're cast as the one dimensional role.  \n\nThis film should be seen for the subject matter, irregardless of where you stand on the issue.

Very simple, to the point sequel to The Blair Witch Project. If you liked that film, I can't see why you wouldn't like this.

It was horrifying and reinvigorating in regards to mainstream horror. As a Blair Witch sequel, however, I'm on the fence.\n\nI don't like the fact we see her. The beauty of the first film and canon lore is that she doesn't exist as a physical entity; rather, it's insinuated she may just be driving other people to insanity. That being said, her appearances were terrifying, and it was super neat to see the old action figure no one liked being given a life of its own (I'm assuming, from the brief appearances, that's what she was based off of).

It's like Adam Wingard knows that we've seen the first movie and we know that the witch is real so there's no need play with uncertainty to create tension. \n\n- Short and fast-paced, kind of reminded me of Deadpool in terms of pacing and length.

A well-used jump scare is fantastic and a classic story telling/mood setting tool. The other problem is that the original movie didn't rely on those to build fear, it was more of a \"discovery horror\" film if that makes sense. The characters gradually went crazy and started fighting amongst each other after each new fucked up thing happened or was discovered. In this film, they just didn't like each other and provoked each other. Made terrible decision after terrible decision but I guess that's the horror genre thing. \n\nSome chilling moments but could have been better. ", "Huge fan of the original. Saw the movie yesterday. It wasn't a bad movie, but I didn't enjoy it all that much.\n\nI'm okay with a lot of the new twists they added. Most of them just built upon what was already established in the first movie - looping time, the stickmen, permanent night - it was all feasible when placed in context with the events of the original.\n\nBut one thing they did that really struck a negative chord with me - something that, IMHO, hurts the ending of the original - was change the Rustin Parr story.\n\nIn the original film, and all the surrounding materials released with it, Rustin Parr was said to have killed 7 kids. Each time he killed one, he'd make a second kid face the corner, and then he'd kill that one. He did this until there was one left, and then he released that one to tell the story.\n\nWhether he was under the influence of a witch or not is immaterial. He made the kid face the corner because, in his words, he \"couldn't take their eyes on him.\"\n\nThat is unsettling. It's disturbing. And it's because it's such a human thought within such an inhuman idea. Murdering children, but taking the time to make sure the other child isn't watching. That's fucked up. That's real horror. That lingers with you.\n\nWhich is why the ending of the first movie is so remarkable. Say what you will, but even though the first movie has a LOT of detractors, a great deal of them agree that the image of Mike staring into the corner was effective. Why? Maybe it's just a spooky image. But mostly it's because it reminds you of Rustin Parr's story. It implies a great deal without showing anything, because of the emotion behind it. Because it makes you think of a small child staring into the corner while something inhuman happens just behind them.\n\nBlair Witch takes that idea and changes it to something completely different and, quite frankly, weak. Early in the film, Lane says that \"if you ever see the witch, it's so frightening you die instantly.\" And he goes on to explain that that's why Rustin Parr made the kids face the wall.\n\nNo. No no no. You just took a genuinely unsettling idea that is frightening BECAUSE it isn't supernatural, and turned it into something that is ONLY scary as a shitty urban legend.\n\nSo ultimately, when Blair Witch reaches its climax and the characters are essentially recreating the ending to the original - only with a different context - it is only scary because OMG THE WITCH IS SCARY AND I MIGHT GET SCARED BY IT.\n\nNot because of anything real. Not because of anything human. Not because of any genuinely disturbing storytelling or any real idea that will stick with you til long after the movie is over.\n\nNow it's just spooky because spooky things are spooky and might get you if you look at them.\n\nAgain, didn't dislike the movie.

I thought it was well done and spooky, even though the best part of the original was leaving it to my imagination.", "Sequelitis/remake/found footage garbage aside, what killed it for me is that it's a prime example of an \"unfair\" horror movie. The protagonists have NO chance to escape let alone fight back against whatever is after them and they did nothing to deserve their fate. Similar to this would be something like Oculus or Unfriended. Sort of like how superman is a boring hero for being all powerful, the blair witch is boring because she can essentially do anything at anytime with no recourse.", "Sheesh y'all...

They all were incredibly genuine. This time around the whole cast of characters felt very uninteresting and forgettable.\n\nI think this movie was doomed to disappoint me, being a big fan of the original.

The whole theater did a collective \"OH SHIT\".\n\nI can understand how critics wouldn't like it though. Horror fans are known for hating jump scares and this one has plenty of them. The characters aren't too interesting and a little cliche. I was hoping this was on purpose and that the characters would surprise me, but oh well.

The time travel aspect was really really cool. I thought at the end in the house with the intense bright light coming into the house was the lighting outside just slowing down showing how time is at a crawl. I also really wish someone from the old cast cameoed in this movie. Like instead of lane in the basement she finds mike who's now aged realistically and within logical limits pertaining to the movie. Hell make him still be standing in the corner or something. I liked we saw the witch I've been looking for screen grabs online at the reveal of her but can't find shit. Her design was really creepy and her thunderous steps were a really cool touch. The breaking of the stickman which voodoo'd that purple haired girl to be broken in half was awesome.

At times it feels like a traditional movie that just has the found footage gimmick overlayed on top.  \n\nJames makes no sense as a character. He's seen the original footage, he thinks his sister might still be alive out there, but he acts totally non-chalant about being in those same woods. He also shares his friend's skepticism about anything weird going on out there.  Which begs the question of just what exactly he's assuming happened to Heather. \n\nThere's an obvious script error where the friend claims to have been in the woods before as part of the search parties...he would have been four or maybe five years old at the time.  Nobody brings a little kid in a search party looking for missing/dead teens!  \n\nI do think there's a much better movie buried in here somewhere.

What I liked about the original was the subtlety of the situation. I never saw tents flying through the air or trees crashing or any of that. The thing that scared me so much about the original is that you never actually saw what happened to them. While some people found that boring I loved it. \n\nI feel like this movie is for people who didn't really like the first one. People who thought the first film was boring. There's some freaky parts in the new one for sure, but I never felt that dread that I feel watching the first one, even to this day. The new Blair witch feels like someone watched the old one, thought it was action packed enough, and tried to remake it to fit their style. It all just seemed like a rushed version of the original with a ton of jump scares. ", "When the credits rolled I couldn't even believe what I just witnessed. The makers of this film are absolutely clueless about what made the original movie so great.\n\nSPOILER WARNING: ( but don't waste your money on this movie..)\n\nFirst off al, the story was nothing more than rehash of the original with some forced moments that try to tie it to the first movie. \n\nThere is 0 subtlety in this film. It is FILLED with not only jump scares, but lame false jump scares where it was \" just a prank\".. This screws up every bit of tension there may have been in this movie. The only tension I had was because I was waiting for the next jumpscare to happen, not because of what was actually happening on screen. \n\nThere's even gore and worst of all: THEY SHOW THE WITCH.  MULTIPLE TIMES. Also, the witch is waaaay too powerfull in this movie and it makes her less scary, just over the top. Less is more. That's my biggest problem with this film, the realistic tone is gone completely from the first minute. The actors in this movie are so obviously actors. They're way too good looking and they talk like they're reading from a script most of the time. The acting in the original movie felt natural and believable. Everytime these characters were on screen you just felt like you were watching actors. Also the lighting was way too good in every scene, nothing felt like we were actually watching a group of people lost in the woods.\n\nBesides all that, this movie brings nothing new to the table. It all comes down to been there done that. This is a movie made for the people who say that the original Blair Witch Project was \" boring because nothing happened and you didn't even see the witch.\" ", "Theory: Some-one here mentioned that Lane can be heard saying 'There has to be 7'.  This means 7 victims, presumably (throwback to Rustin Parr killing 7 kids).\n\nHeather, Mike and Josh make 3, and this new crowd makes a total of 8, leaving out Lane himself (since he is the witch's new helper).\n\nEight is too many, so one person can be let go.  Is that why Lane throws Lisa into the pit..? To actually save her, as opposed to killing her? She won't be able to look at the witch there, so she might somehow get to live / escape.  Given a choice between saving her and James, he chooses her, as she's right there, and he knows that James is already a lost cause because of his obsession with finding his sister at all costs.\n\nProbably dumb and inconsequential, but I just wondered if it might have some significance. ", "Idk what to think of this movie. It's not terrible but it's not that great. It definitely has it's scary moments with Talia being bent in half and the ending house scene was pretty spoopy. But the unnecessary jump scares were lame as hell and happened way too much. And overall it was just very confusing because most of the movie is them running and screaming in the woods at night. The whole time manipulation aspect is very cool but it reminded me a lot of Grave Encounters, I would have liked to see more daytime scenes. Ashley's infection seemed very pointless because they don't address it at the end. But the consensus is she got infected and turned into some monster. I also didn't understand the stomping tree monster thing that killed Peter. This is one of those movies that make more sense once you come on Reddit to see what other people think lol.", "I absolutely love the original. That being said, I can also admit to the fact that we live in a world where remakes run rampant. However, I really loved what Wingard and Barrett added to the Blair Witch mythos. When Lane and Talia re-emerged from the woods, all ragged, and said it had been six (?) days, I was totally engrossed. What a cool concept. I really loved how they gave it a more modern approach (a la the found footage films of today) but still gave it actual reason. This is a smart movie, I have to say. \n\nThe film doesn't deserve all the flack it's getting for jump scares. Wingard specifically said this is more of a roller coaster ride through the Black Hills woods. Roller coasters have inclines, which I consider a jump scare to be. All to reach the peak (ex: Talia's chiropractic session, witch reveal). So I question why people hate the jumps in this movie if they add to the piece as a whole. Who cares? The jump scares are in addition to the actual scares! I don't deem them a negative, for they add an unease to the film. Something that makes you guess \"When will I be jumping next?\" \n\nReally dug the movie. This couldn't have been another, simplistic Blair Witch film. It's not 1999.", "Wow I was extremely disappointed with this. It was way too Hollywood :(", "Just got through seeing it. I liked it. I loved the first one. I think it would have been cool if they somehow worked in a shot of Mike from the original as Lane killed Heather. So we could get some closure on what exactly happened to Mike Josh and Heather. It would also add to the time travel thing that the film hints to", "They really should have done more with the rock piles and voodoo figures.", "Anyone able to decipher the message written on the door in the house?", "The creepiest part was the voodoo doll part. If you notice, the only thing you hear is creaking wood during that part. That was truly unsettling. That was far scarier than any of the shrieking monster sounds that they had. ", "the only character in this film i really liked was peter - he felt genuine and real, in terms of being the only one properly freaked out by the darknet dude and girl. i liked the fact that his hate towards them created a hostile and unsettling atmosphere between the human characters at the start - it was cool. wish his death was better tho, was dissapointing that he just completely dissapears. \n\nalso the shot with him looking at the confederate flag, then looking at the camera was fucking hilarious. can't believe i haven't seen anyone talking about it lmao\n", "Huge fan of the original (one of my top maybe three horror films of all time), so it was always going to be a tough one to match up with my feelings on BWP.  However, trying to be objective:\n\n**Positives:**\n\n- I really liked how for the first half it maintained the feel of the original, but being more up-to-date with technology such as drones etc.\n\n- I love how it firmly stayed within the lore of the original and expanded a little bit on Rustin Parr and the mythology of the witch herself.\n\n- It was cool how we only saw just the briefest of glances at the witch, sent a shiver down my spine.\n\n- The time loop twist at the end was a neat idea and again, fits well with the original (which I believe was a theory the original director confirmed).\n\n- The last 15 minutes or so were wonderfully relentless in keeping that high-alert horror going.\n\n**Negatives**\n\n- This is more a personal one, but as soon as Lane said he had to go with the group, I called the twist right there and then.  Likewise, it was super obvious that there was going to be a Lane heel turn in there at some point.\n\n- Relied too much on jump scares and not enough tension.  One of the things that makes BWP so scary for me isn't a bunch of jump scares, it's that slow burn horror of getting lost, with most of the panic coming from their own feeling of helplessness.  This movie was very much 0-100 in the first night.  Less is more when it comes to found footage.\n\n- As creepy as the glances of the witch was, I'd rather it not be shown at all.  It leaves no room for interpretation, only a 100% confirmation that it's something paranormal.\n\n- For similar reasons, the reliance on special effects.  I don't need to see someone getting dragged off or hurled into the air - one of the most creepy things I'll remember about BWP is them finding just a few bloody teeth, no big jump scares.\n\n- Too many characters.  It felt like an excuse to just up the body count in exchange for good character development.\n\n**TL:DR - Liked it, didn't love it.  Relied too much on paranormal genre jump scares over the original's slowly rising dread and I felt all the twists were super obvious.  However, as a sequel it works well and I enjoyed the expanded lore and general feeling of the movie (especially the first half).  Although I feel other more recent found footage films have done a better job with less material. 6/10 **", "So I went in to this with no bias at all. I had seen maybe the very first teaser trailer when it was still called the woods but that doesn't give away anything and have never seen the original. I don't even think if seen a found forage horror before unless you count Cloverfield as one.  I'd say the first hour was kind of boring. I wasn't a big fan of the kind of awkward humor by the cast, fake jump scares, the constant \"what was that\" then screaming and running away from something we don't even get a chance to glimpse at. The little subplot they had going on with something moving in the girls leg really went absolutely no where. When she pulls some sort of string or animal or whatever that was that was literally the end of it then I guess she's all better and can climb trees now. I don't even want to know how the girl had the remote for the drone when Lisa (I think that's her name) had it last. Once the girl breaks in half it starts to pick up into what I wished the whole movie was. Eventually when Lisa and James? Get to the house it really gets good. The suspense is actually real instead of the noise of crackling dead leaves created fake suspense. We finally get to see the witch only just barely and she looked ok for the most part. I kind of wish we would have been able to see her earlier in the film in the background for a second or two  as a little gift to people in audience who were willing to scan the entire frame. Anyway back to the house. It gets pretty good, the shaky cam used is just enough to give some realism but still have whatever on the screen visible. Even when Lisa is crawling through the tunnel I was expecting her to be dragged backwards like another cliche but thankfully that didn't happen. The ending I felt was satisfying enough aswell even though it's pretty typical for the kind of movie it was. Also Im not sure if it's related in anyway but the entire house sequence plays similar to the demo of resident evil 7 and I really liked the vibe. I also felt the cast had a pretty good chemistry for the most part give or take a few scenes. \n\nTL;DR First hour of the movie is kind of a snorefest. Goes a little balls to walk towards last 30 minutes. Everything involving the house reminded me exactly like the RE7 demo so I really liked that part. 6/10 from me.

There were definitely jump scares but they were great and used effectively, and I was honestly terrified. I can't remember the last time I watched a movie through my fingers. ", "I'm a *huge* fan of the original, and I have to say I really enjoyed this film. But with one caveat: I think the film is at its best when it's not rehashing the stuff we saw the first time around, but with a bigger budget and modern effects. \n\nThe ear-cams were a nice way to avoid the problem most people have with POV found footage movies (PUT THE FUCKING CAMERA DOWN!) but at the same time were used to cheat WAY too much. I found all the running through the woods stuff to be a bit dull, and done much better in the original, and the middle section was where the almost lost me. \n\nBut that final act, when they made it to the house, that honestly redeemed the whole movie for me. When Lisa get's thrown into that pit I felt myself tense up with anxiety. Then when she almost gets stuck in the tunnel I was REALLY anxious. Then the final moments with the corner, and everything? Just great! \n\nI also loved that the film clearly respected the original, and all the expanded universe stuff the original filmmakers created. I was worried we were in reboot territory where they would make up a bunch of shit that wasn't as good as the original stuff the Haxan team came up with, but was so glad they simply expanded on all of that.\n\nAll in all, I was very pleased. It's not a masterpiece, but it worked. And in an age where so few horror films genuinely work, that was refreshing.\n\nBut those fucking jump scares. Come on guys. Really makes the original films <i>lack</i> of those all the more impressive.", "Just saw the movie last night. I liked it. Was that broken/burnt tree from the beginning of the movie (where Lane/Talia said they found the tape) the same tree that was outside of the witch's house at the end? If it was, then it makes me think that the reason that nobody could ever find the witch's house is that it's in some sort of alternate dimension or hidden by her curse. That would make sense that they found the tape by that tree since it was technically right next to the house even though they couldn't see it. What are your thoughts?", "It has a few interesting ideas. It's just too similar to the original. I give it a C-.", "[deleted]", "I thought this was absolute trash. Truly just so bad.

It's not that commonly used as a trope nowadays, all the horror movies I've seen, I can't remember the last modern one where the black guy actually died first. \n\nBeyond that, I think the deaths made sense at the point in the movie where they were at. \nPeter's death was relatively open-ended to keep up the question if there was a Witch or not. \nTalia's death had to come after Peter, to give more weight to the, \"we've been gone for five days,\" reveal and some more oomph to her being snapped in half. By that point, we know that shit has officially hit the fan. \nAshley couldn't die right away to pay off her injury. \nLane had to make it to the house because of the tie-in to Rustin Parr. \nJames had to be white and make it until the end because of his connection to Heather. \nLisa, the final girl, is actually a Hispanic actress.

The movie doesn't have an ounce of subtlety or dread. Showing the Witch was a mistake, as was the stupid \"injured foot\" subplot. Not a whole lot of good stuff to say about it, really.", "I think a lot of the cheezy horror movie cliches in this movie (angry black guy that dies first, body snatcher, scary greek mythos (medusaesque), questionable emotional decisions, semi crazy woodspeople, clausterphopia scene, and the weird reality distortions/light shows at the end) can all be explained as the Witch contorlling the entire world. It feels like an experiment from the scary factory that was in the basement of The Cabin in The Woods. Its everything hopeless horrific scenario that could happen to this random group of people.

It never gave me chills like the original but I enjoyed it nonetheless.\nThanks for the down votes for expressing my opinion ", "There were a few new and interesting ideas to the mythology in this movie but they were never expanded on or explained.  This is a sequel to the 1999 original movie and with that said, it should have a progressive narrative that tells us more about the Blair Witch.  This movie however, just gives us more questions with no answers and pulls the same ol' 'cut to black' ending.  I was hyped and excited for this movie and granted, 98% of the movie had me attached to the story and characters but that literal ending ruined it for me.  You can't just not explain what the fuck is going on in a sequel that is almost a remake of the original. I loved the idea of time not existing or happening normally in the woods. I loved that Lane and Talia were really \"lost\" in the woods for 5 days when in real time it was only about 12 hours.  I thought they'd expand on that in the ending with Lane reappearing and he looks like he's been missing for a month.  This was a really cool concept that didn't have a pay-off.  I would have have liked to have had closer on Heather from the original.  That what upsets me, this movie doesn't resolve questions from the original and only gives us more confusing questions for the sequel. You can't do that these days with sequels because now I have no interest in a 3rd movie (or 4th, whichever).  Overall, I thought this movie had great potential with a fresh director and cast but it feels the filmmaker held back or was controlled too much to really dig deep into a truly fresh movie.  Like the studio wanted a remake and didn't let him go a different path.   Oh well....C+ of a movie. ", "I think the main thing that killed this movie for me (which sucks because TBWP is my favourite horror movie of all time) was the sheer amount of jumpscares. I'm sick of modern horror movies overdoing jumpscares, they rely way too heavily on it to scare us. That was what I loved about the original. It had zero jumpscares yet managed to get under my skin, that's why that movie was so effective. Jump scares ruin a horror movie for me, especially if used way too often, as you can't actually sit down and enjoy the movie. You're constantly on edge. \nThere were a few creepy scenes but overall I'm severely disappointed. The look of the witch was pretty disturbing I guess? but once again cliche.", "What a sack of shit. \n\nI mean, seriously, did they watch the original and seriously think \"this is scary, but its held back by its ambiguity.\"\n\nThe Blair Witch Project is the best example of less is more and this shit absolutely does not care about that philosophy.

I would say around 70-75% would be more accurate, but to be in the 30 percent range is almost an injustice.\n\nEven the original has 86%. Granted, that movie was much more effective at the time, and felt much more authentic overall.\n\nI just can't find anything in Blair Witch that would put it below a C-grade. If I had to rate the movie, I'd give it a B, maybe a B+. Really intense, a lot of new twists and elements adding to the mythology of the franchise, and remained very true to the original. Acting was shoddy at times and many times it felt much more like a conventional movie than the original.", "I enjoyed the movie but I did have  a few problems.\nJump scares.  Good lord the amount of stupid jump scares.  Please Directors quit pulling that crap.  it's stupid.\n\n2. It was the same movie basically.  This movie added very little to the mythos.  \n\n3.  The whole time being night.  While cool it also took some of the creepiness out of it.  The original was nice because they would walk all day and by night time you're back where you started.  I know they pulled that here but something bout it being night all the time took some element of it away from me.\n\n4.  The black people die first.  Standard Horror movie thing that I'm really amazed they stuck with.  I really think with Peter being the skeptic that it would have been cool for him to basically just be thrown out of the woods due to the witch having no power over him because he would explain away everything refusing to fall to the witch.\n\n5. Jump scares,  Again the damn stupid jump scares.  Any chacne they could they worked in a stupid jump scare.  \n\n6. The do we or don't we shot.   This is an issue with the found footage type of movies.  They want to have the shot of the monster without having the shot of the monster.

Either show me the monster or figure out a different way to kill them or make them disappear.\n\n7. as someone else said in this thread.  The no chance of winning thing takes out all suspense.

Y'know, when everybody wasn't sure if it was real or fake?

Same structure, same things happen, same bad decisions are made. Only this time, the director uses a couple of not-found-footage shots...

And makes a total of one clever decision (a video clip is repeated, in a way that's easy to miss).\n\nHeartless, soulless, pointless.\n\nMinor props go to Brandon Scott, whose character of Peter provided the best source of entertainment and normal-personness in the cast.", "I was expecting another horrible remake/reboot movie that this summer was plagued with, and the first third of the movie had me thinking I was on point, but when the second act started, it really picked up in both quality and suspense, and the third act goes on overdrive and became one of my favorite movies of the year.\n\nGranted, I adored the original Blair Witch movie so I have my bias, but seeing the trailer beforehand and the year's movies, I didn't expect to have my heart pumping during the third act and being incredibly satisfied with how it concluded. It suffers from a few of the bad horror tropes (in that first third of the movie I mentioned: dumb jump scares, telling scary stories, bad forced jokes), but as it goes on, I got more and more into it.\n\nThe biggest praise I can think of is the sound design and the pacing (compared to the original, at least). The loud cuts between footage keep you alert and focused on the film, and when the good bits start, oh man, \"shrieking\" is a good word that comes to mind. As for pacing, they don't spend 60-70% of the movie talking about the map, so if that was a huge turn-off from the first movie, that's out.\n\nThis movie is a great time to get with friends and watch in the theaters, IMO.

There's no real dramatic payoff to anything.

It bordered on Roland Emmerich's tactic of adding last minute characterization before a big disaster happens. Second, is this weekend really the best weekend to have a film where in the first 20 minutes there are two sequences depicting planes crashing into New York City? It just sorta felt like it would be better service to the film to come out like the end of this month for that.

Have you had any troubles at home?\" they ask Tom Hanks' character. \"Simulations show that you could make it back to the airport,\" another gripes.

There's no better kind of movie to see in a crowded theater than a scary movie. If you let yourself enjoy it and not get too upset at all the chattering and shouting advice, it's really great.\n\nI loved how small and focused the premise was. This wasn't a ghost story where, when it's over, you'll lie in bed scared at every creak in your house. This wasn't a movie where the villain is some supernatural threat where you think \"why is this ghost so hell bent on terrorizing this family, no matter where they go?\" In this case the \"terror\" was just a guy in his house. The people came to him, looking for trouble. There's nothing about the premise that should make anyone stay up at night scared of every shadow in their homes, but the movie worked anyway because it was so perfectly executed.\n\nMost 90 minute movies are about 80-90 pages for the screenplay. I'd bet this one was only about 50 pages, and most of the dialogue was front-loaded in the opening act. There's so little talking I would love to read about the making of the movie.

You can still like something, whilst admitting to the myriad of problems it has. These are the most glaring ones in my book:\n\n- How in the hell did the police not find anything suspicious about the semen covered turkey baster and sex dungeon?? Especially when you consider there were also newspaper clippings concerning a missing girl, who the police know killed the blind man's daughter, strewn around the place. There is no way he is getting out of that situation an innocent man.\n\n- While we're at it why and how was a blind man even keeping newspaper cuttings in the first place??\n\n- Like many others here, I really didn't buy into the blind man freeing himself, finding the gun, keeping the dog quiet, and getting back to Rocky and Alex before they managed to leave.\n\n- How did the dog get off his chain? (Tbf I may have missed something in that regard)\n\n- Seriously, why would you keep a security system that automatically calls the police, when you have kidnapped someone for breeding and got them locked up in your basement?\n\nA couple of other minor complaints:\n\n- I kind of felt like the dog was too easy to get away from at times, like after every chase scene he seems to just disappear conveniently, and then randomly pop up at random again later. It just felt a little weird to me.\n\n- If his hearing was that good, shouldn't shooting the gun in an enclosed space have disoriented him more than it did? Especially when you consider how badly the alarm affected him when it went off...\n\nThose are my issues anyhow. I still enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it to others. I just wish they had of put some actual thought into the finer plot details, if they had it could have actually merited its 90% RT score. As it stands, I personally think it's a bit overrated by the critics.", "So much love for this movie.\n\nBeautiful cinematography. The tracking shot when they first go in the house was superb. The girl ends up locking the dog in the trunk like what happened to her when she was a kid, heartbreaking. \n\nStephen Lang getting that girl pregnant was a big fucking surprise, that is some twisted shit. \n\nAnd the slo-mo cum drip, oh have slo-mo cum drip!", "The \"twist\" at the end of the movie is that Detroit Police responded to a house on that block in that extremely short amount of time. \n\n\nI thought it was a pretty great movie ", "Only just watched this today and I have to say I'm surprised so many people enjoyed it.\n\nThe first scenes introduce us to our characters who are all in way too much make-up and bizarrely enough are robbing someones very modern house, outfitted with security systems, with no disguise's whatsoever and their faces in full view. A pretty telling sign that this film is out of its depth.\n\nIt gets pretty good for a moment when they first enter the old dude's house but can't sustain itself very long for all the plot holes which work to constantly break the viewers immersion. Most of these have been discussed already here so I'll only detail the ones I thought were the most silly.\n\nThe majority of the scenes with the dog make zero sense. You can't trap a dog by hiding behind a door - they can smell you, that's the whole point, that's why people use them as guard animals. Also in the car scene the dog is barking right next to her face and ignoring the majority of here body right beneath it. Why did it just bark in her face instead of biting her?\n\nThe sheer implausibility of the ending is probably the worst bit for me though. \n\nThe speed at which the police arrive, the state the house is in, literally everything, works together to make the ending seem so dumb.\n\nWhen I saw the scene where she finally breaks free from the house I thought it looked silly. The police clearly could have seen her running away! Then it completely unravelled the plausibility of the old man getting away with any of what transpired. \n\nThe police are arriving at a house where there have been two very suspicious deaths. One guy has had his face beaten to shit, then been shot in the neck. The other guy has both a gun-shot wound through his head as well as a pair of shears through his abdomen (a post-morterm wound). The whole house is littered with bullet holes in every single section.\n\nThe outside entrance to the basement has been forced (literally the only way the old man could have escaped at the end because he broke the lock on it earlier to stop anyone getting out) and inside is a dungeon, where there are newspaper clippings of a currently missing girl who has a direct link to the old man (killer of his daughter) as well as a whole load of his own semen. \n\nFor some reason people seem to think he could just explain away the police, or somehow stop them going into the basement. Literally every single time he fired a gun or beat up the robbers his actions left a mark that they're going to look into. \n\nThere's no way they could look around the house and not be led by the massive trail of destruction into the basement where the newspaper clippings and semen (as well as the fact that he even has a sex dungeon) would land him in shit. \n\nThis film is silly, and silliness isn't particularly tense or scary.

And that turkey baster scene was...something else.\nMy main issue with this movie is that I really didn't like any of the characters. I couldn't root for the old guy because he was fucked up, and I couldn't root for the kids because they were all thieves.\nIn fact, the only one I was rooting for was the dog. I actually think one of my favorite parts of this movie was that they didn't kill the dog, they let him live. I am so sick of seeing the dog get killed in every horror movie. It makes me so sad.

My favorite things about it are its pacing, the performances, and the setting.\n\nI think any film maker interested in horror can use *Don't Breathe* as a lesson in excellent pacing.  No scene was unnecessary.  I think only the first 10-15 minutes were used to introduce us to the characters and the situation.  The 2nd scene showed us that these 3 friends are burglars.  Because Alex is a bit of a nag, the reason for his expositional lines made a lot of sense.  One of the next scenes showed us what Rocky's motivation was for being a thief.  The next scene showed them finding out about the Blind Man.  Then *boom*, time for the big, final job.  Those introductory scenes were tight, quick, and flowed nicely.\n\nOnce Rocky, Alex, and Money broke into the Blind Man's house, that shit got intense and it stayed intense until the very end.  \n\nThe performances were also good.  I watch a lot of horror movies starring young people, and those new actors tend to suck.  But Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette both did an admirable job playing thieves we could symathize with, and Daniel Zovatto was an excellent douchebag.  And Stephen Lang - fuck, that guy can be scary.  Strangely, even his physically intimidating and crazy Blind Man was almost a character I could sympathize with.  Almost.\n\nFinally, the setting: an almost abandoned subrub in Detroit.  *It Follows* was another top-notch horror film that used Detroit as a setting, but in that movie the wasted city was used mainly to establish a bleak, hopeless atmosphere.  In *Don't Breathe*, the nearly empty Detroit suburb facilitated the action.  It makes sense that all this shit can happen during a robbery-gone-wrong without anyone noticing, because there's nobody around to notice.\n\nAll-in-all, this was one of the most exciting horror movies I've seen. ", "Last scene, Rocky got her leg/knee stepped on hard, that should render her *immobilize*... she proceeds to run across the road before the cops come?", "I don't think anyone mentioned this yet but I really like how the blind man's strength in the beginning (his hearing) became his weakness in the end (with the alarm going off) \n", "So you're going to tell me the blind guy kidnapped his daughter's killer who was recently found innocent of the murder and no one suspected him.....\n\nEdit.\n\nAnd that you're going to tell me the police didn't investigate the rest of the house and see that weird bed mattress thing that he had and ask him what the fuck that was", "I loved the the way this was shot, the performances, the suspense, and the fresh take on the home invasion thriller.\n\nThat being said, there are just a couple of plot points that I can't seem to get past:\n\n* The news report at the end makes no mention of the obvious 'prison cell' nor of the woman who was being held captive. Sure the investigation could still be ongoing and there could be evidence of Rocky being there, but the captive and the prison cell *is right there* but there is no mention of it.\n\n* People grieve in different ways. I was with the movie even after it was revealed he was holding the killer captive, but when he explained it was so she could bear a child? That was a turn that just didn't feel right and even an as Veteran who endured some shit even before he lost his daughter-- I just felt that was a strange motive. Although it produced the only moment I've ever gagged in a theater, so there's that.\n\nDespite those couple points, it was a fantastic watch!", "If you had told me beforehand that there was a scene in this movie where the bad guy has to drink his own cum, I really wouldn't have believed you.", "I liked it. One of my favourite movies this year. I do have one gripe though.  \n  \nThe beginning scene ruined the end. There was no reason to show that scene at the beginning. As soon as Rocky escapes, you know she's getting caught again. The beginning scene ruined that entire sequence because you knew no matter what happened, she was getting caught. There was no suspense or thrill. It's almost like someone spoiled the movie before you started watching it.  \n  \nI'm new to the genre. I don't watch many movies like this so I'm not sure how many others do that sort of thing. I can safely say I'm not a fan. No reason to show that scene.", "I liked most of the film. However, despite its short run time it felt too long for me.\n\nThe last 15 or so minutes? Those dragged and kind of ruined the film for me.

Those would have felt stronger in my mind.\n\nBut everything from her escape (and accidentally sacrificing Alex to do so), to the long car/dog scene, to getting dragged back, to having another struggle fight. It felt repetitive, like it wasn't adding a lot to the film. It added \"closure\" but it also picked a moral side, and to be honest, I wanted everyone to lose, because everyone sucked here regardless of their own life circumstances.\n\nI loved Lang as the old man and had some genuine fears, but the last 10-15 minutes just turned it into an okay and potentially forgettable film for me. If you want to see my full review, you can [read it here](http://gorgview.com/dont-breathe)! :)", "How the heck was this old blind guy going to raise a baby?", "I thought it was ok, but I really feel like they took an awesome, high-concept premise and kind of wasted a lot of potential for something really interesting. I'm honestly disappointed overall because I was really looking forward to this movie and seeing what they could come up with. There were some cool moments and clever turning points, and the movie is really well-crafted. However, I thought there were a lot of just dumb \"movie\" moments, cheap jump scares, and things that either didn't make sense or just took me out of the movie a little bit with the logical inconsistency (like the dude falling out the window when it was established that there were bars). I was still entertained enough throughout, but the movie really started to lose some of its mojo when they revealed that the blind man kidnapped his daughter's killer, and even more so when they revealed why she was still down there. The most compelling thing the movie had going for it, in my opinion, was the fact that the antagonist/villain (in the beginning, before we know what's really going on with him) is kind of the good guy, and the protagonists are the bad guys, and we sort of want to root for both. Rocky and Alex's motivations are strong enough for us to care about them, and the blind dude is just a grieving war vet defending himself from intruders. If the story continued to treat him as such, that would have been fine by me. I really wish the film would have treated the plot more like a chess game between the characters and less like a full on clumsy horror movie. I was hoping they were really going to play up the advantages and disadvantages of both parties a lot more than they did, but the blind guy's senses only seemed to be an advantage/disadvantage when the plot needed it to be, rather than really digging into how people in that situation might come up with ways to gain the upper hand. That, coupled with the idea that there's no clear cut \"good\" or \"bad\" guy, should have been the bread and butter of the movie, rather than the start and stop twists and over the top horror sequences (with the exception of the pitch black basement sequence, which was pretty cool). For instance, imagine if the blind man kept a silenced pistol (knowing that he'd be extra sensitive to the sound of a gunshot) instead of the hand-cannon that he kept under his bed. And what if the intruders realized that they couldn't communicate verbally at all, and had to communicate via text or with some kind of visual cues, or else he might hear them (which is something that really bugged me a lot watching the movie, was how \"loud\" they were acting around someone that would have a heightened sense of hearing).

He's buying our silence. He needs us to take it.\" Rocky thinks she has it both ways, having \"killed\" the old man and escaped Detroit with her sister and the money. When she sees the news report of him alive and seen as a victim, she realizes that she actually made a trade. Justice for the money.

Same thing applies here. The film does a good job making you want to root for at least two of the three thieves from the get go. That's literally what the first 10 minutes of the film are there for. Characters aren't black and white. They're complex with shades of grey. That's why you can feel for the blind man in a majority of the film until you learn more things about him.

This would explain why, in their own words, the lead characters kept saying that they only had to do this bad thing for everything to be good again, like how Rocky said that they would never have to steal again if they get to steal the money, or how the blind man promises to set the girl free after 9 months, once she gives birth to a child (but then again we don't know if he's really gonna set her free then because she might just report him or look for the child or I'm overthinking).\n\nBoth of them really just wanted a new start, and only one of them actually did.

It's well appreciated.\n\nThen again, both of these pairs find their own strains, their own failures, and their own parallels as the plot moves forward.\n\nAnd all of these things tell one story.\n\nEveryone in this movie had something taken from them.

This is going to be one of those movies on my shelf that my kids will always wonder why it's there,  and they will never really know what it means to me personally and everything my father has been through and is still there for me and my family.

Shit, I'd rather use a loan shark and give away a big chunk of said earnings... Or why not try and raise private funding? The oil offers a guaranteed income! \n\nPart of me wishes the oil was just or theory they had, or that they discovered it AFTER paying off the bank...

Those cars, even if they're beaters, drive reliably and must be worth a few thousand each for parts, especially the Cadillac(?) that they end up with. The backhoe rental must have put them back as well. The automatic rifle, hunting rifle, and 2 pistols could be sold. I kept thinking that they're destroying close to $44,000 of their own property to MAYBE get enough in small bills from the banks to make it back.

He's well aware that he's a loose cannon, that he can easily fuck this thing up, as he demonstrates time and time again, but Pine is put in this dilemma that inevitably results in an outcome that's simultaneously poignant and tragic. Poignant because Pine's intentions for the robbery are in a good place, while at the same time it got to the point that he could see coming, losing a man of his own blood for good. It really is a dense outcome, and will be just as troubling to him as Bridges' character says, if not more so. I loved this film.", "Holy fuck this movie sucked.

For me, it's one of the best films this year, by a country mile. And Pine's performance is worthy of a nomination, at least.

By that I mean in a way which engages you, makes you think, and makes you care about the characters; even the waitresses!\n\nThe morality doesn't hit you over the head, nor does it taste sickly sweet. There's social commentary here, but it's not preachy or unfairly judgemental. It's a tale that gets honest performances from all involved. And the reason I'm a little gushy here is because I initially went in cold, and yet was actually super satisfied when I came out both times! \n\nI want films to mesmerise me. It's a shame that this summer (at my local multiplex) has been so grim, with 'blockbuster' after 'blockbuster'.

Gives me hope for Sicario sequels without Denis Villanueve or Roger Deakins. \n\nPlot was simple, but the characters brought it alive. Casting was spot-on. Jeff Bridges could play this character in his sleep, but he gives it life. The dynamic between he and his partner were excellent.\n\nThe movie lives or dies on the brothers, though and they nail it. Chris Pine giving the performance of his career in my opinion. Doesn't coast on his charm and good looks, his performance is subtle and fascinating. Ben Foster always gives it 110% but here his talents aren't wasted in bad movie and hopefully this leads to more Ben Mendelsohn-type supporting character roles for Foster going forward.\n\nLoved how a lot of the shots in the film seemed like portraits, too.

All deaths were from the revolver or blot action rifles. Also how at the end of the film, Jeff Bridges trades his Ivory handled 1911 for a concealed Glock 19, it looks like. And how Chris Pine trades the Glock for a lever action rifle. Does anyone see this? Perhaps a theme of old vs new? Or a subtle dig at the recent demonization of AR-15s...also significant is how a concealed carrier is murdered; perhaps that's talking about how sometimes you don't have to be the hero.", "The best bit (sad as it was) I think was when Alberto was shot.

It had some solid stuff, but nothing really clicked and Phillips didn't have any of his edge. This felt so tame compared to WoWS and so limp compared to Lord of War.

Sure, the entire thing is amazing, but the ending really sold me on it overall. ", "This is definitely one of my favorite movies, full stop. \n\nNot this year, not of animated movies. I adored this film.", "This movie is absolutely amazing. It feels so alive and full of love, every character really comes to life on-screen. The fact that they all feel so real and alive when all they are is little puppets in a warehouse in Oregon is amazing. I honestly can't even believe stop-motion is a thing that can be this good. The amount of hard work, talent, and dedication needed to pull something like this off is extremely admirable.\n\nBut it would be pointless if the story or filmmaking was weak, and again Laika shows that they know what they are doing in that department. Not a single scene or second is wasted here. While it's basic plot is a pretty typical heroes journey, the characters, environments, poetic and gorgeous imagery, and the themes that were explored really elevate it well-beyond feeling anything close to cliche or recycled.\n\nA lot of kids movies have got mile-a-minute storytelling, lots of pop tunes and upbeat music, flashy visuals, and are full of lame, lazy jokes. While some movies like that are decent and enjoyable, it was so great to see an animated \"kids\" movie that really respected the entire audience. While there are a lot of great jokes, action scenes, and it moves pretty quickly Kubo is a movie that isn't afraid to go to some dark places, or give some time to let the emotional scenes sink in. The kids in my audience were into it.\n\nWhile some will write it off just because it's an animated movie, I think there really are some genuinely thoughtful and touching ideas explored here. The power and importance of storytelling, the nature of memory and loss, and even life and death are all touched upon and included in a natural and fitting way. I think this film has more on it's mind that a lot of adult dramas I've seen recently.\n\nThis movie has better action scenes and more imagination than any other big action blockbuster I've seen this year. I'm not sure what kind of research went into this, but it felt like an authentic portrayal of Asian culture, and made me want to learn more about it. \n\nI also loved how there weren't any exposition dumps about Kubo or his mother and their magic. He just played his instrument and the paper came to life. It was a confident and bold decision to introduce us and say \"yeah, he's magic, here's what he does, now let's get on with it.\" Bold and confident are both adjectives I'd use to describe the film as a whole. The film had a very clear and unique sense of identity and purpose, and kept consistent the whole way through.\n\nThere are so many images in here that will be burned into my memory, particularly that scene where Kubo was underwater and there were all those giant eyes staring at him. This is one of the most gorgeous movies I've seen in so long, and I can't wait to see it again. Even the 3D was utilized well, something that I usually hate.\n\nIf I ever have kids, this will be a movie that I cannot wait to show them. I loved and adored everything about it. This is about as close to a perfect movie as you can get. My favorite of this year so far. \n", "What a wonderful film! I took my 5 y.o. Son to see this and there were so many moments in the movie that parallel my time with my son. Kubo and his dad playing \"I Spy\", Hanzo teaching Kubo how to aim a bow and arrow (I just bought my son a slingshot and we practice his aiming). I have been waiting for a movie like this all year that we can both enjoy because \"Dory\" and \"Secret Life of Pets\" were both good but neither gave me that uplifting feeling this movie gave me. ", "Mostly, I just wish this movie was 40 minutes longer. The creation/animation of this movie is a triumph, but honestly, it doesn't earn a lot of it's major plot points. It probably would have delayed the movie's already long production time, but I would have loved to sit with and learn about the key characters longer than we did.", "I've been hyped about this movie since I saw its poster 1 year ago. \n\nIt exceeded my expectations so much. My favorite part was just the art itself. It was a beautiful movie, and I couldn't take my eyes away. \n\nThe action was incredible, and captivating, and I loved how the movie didn't need the characters to verbally describe what was happening, the implied stuff was subtle but not too vague. \n\nIt even got a slight emotional response from me, with the story.\n\nAt first I didn't like how Grandpa Moon dude just turned into a normal guy, but after thinking about it, it was good, because Kubo didn't need to kill him, and he was able to help him in the end,. It was wonderful how the town told his story and memories as a good man instead of Mr Evil.\n\nThe stop motion was incredible, and it mixed flawlessly with the CGI. The sisters were creepy, too.\n\n\nFantastic movie, 100% recommend", "I really enjoyed this film. I was surprised at how good McConaughey was. Like he was fantastic in this film. The only issue I have is that I wish they had explained where Kubo's mother came from and more about her magic. But it still was fantastic ", "I was ready to absolutely fall in love with this movie after his mother's sacrifice. There was a great mystery behind why his family became so divided, why his eye matters so much, and why his mother had fled. It had all of the elements of a great story waiting to be told: a great thematic setup, a wondrous artistic backdrop and a clear end goal to work towards, but Kubo and the Two Strings complete fumbles it. It's shocking to me how poorly written the middle and end sections of this movie are when the beginning is so well done. \n\nKubo has an interesting story setup as it\u2019s a clear Hero's Journey narrative (He's literally in the belly of a whale at one point) but with the Hero entirely aware that he is the Hero because he is a storyteller himself, and aware of how the story ought to go. This is a great setup for a subversion of the Hero's Journey when things don't go according as planned. \n\nThe problem with the middle parts of this movie is the three trials in this movie don't follow the Hero's Journey in revealing Kubo's character nor are they a subversion of the trials that makes the Hero self-reflect on what he should be learning. They just exist as action set pieces and mediocre joke setups that don't fit tonally with the rest of the movie. The first trial is literally just a giant skeleton that serves no characterization purposes. The second trial is explained as the trial that tempts the heart of the hero, but it did nothing of the sort except to reveal that the Monkey was his mother. \n\nThe reveal that his mother was not only alive, but also his nagging over-protective companion had little emotional impact on Kubo other than relief; when it should have been a crowning dramatic moment where Kubo reconciles with the fact that mother\u2019s character isn\u2019t as he expected. The third trial relies on Kubo being incredibly dense as he follows the advice of his evil grandfather, the Moon King, in a dream and goes straight into a trap. And it wasn't as if the Moon King tricked Kubo, he told Kubo who he was and Kubo still fell for it. Neither his father, nor mother, nor the origami Hanzo who guided them to the two other sacred armor pieces, questions the idea of following Kubo's dream.\n\nThe third trial\u2019s execution is bizarre to watch. His goofy stag beetle companion is revealed to be his father whom he has admired for his entire life, vows to protect Kubo, and then just dies without consequence. And his mother is then murdered for the second time in front of Kubo. We should be feeling the extent of Kubo's loss here, but we aren't given the emotional space to feel it. The movie instead goes straight into the next action scene. The reveal that the helmet was where his home village was, isn't set up enough to be meaningful. Was this done by his mother before her amnesia? Is there a reason it was the sunset bell that called Kubo home before dark? And more importantly, why is there a magical set of armor in this story in the first place?\n\nThe overall world of Kubo is not fleshed out enough. We are told that the Gods sent Kubo's mother and her sisters to kill anyone who tried to complete the set of magical armor as they would become too powerful. But what does the armor do? The armor isn't completely worthless as they clearly are magical, so it\u2019s not a subversion of the Hero\u2019s Journey; nor are they the key to defeating the Moon King as that was the Two Strings that Kubo use to re-string his Shamisen. They are neither useful nor useless which makes them just a MacGuffin to pad out the story. \n\n\nThe motivation of the Moon King is comically one dimensional. He hates humans and that's about it. What exactly separates him from humans is meant to be explained by him wanting to take Kubo's remaining eye, but I didn't hear a satisfactory reason as to why sight was key to the condition of humanity. Thematically, Kubo's main problem is that it is simultaneously anvilicious with its main message yet it also feels muddled when you look at the action leading up to that message. I\u2019m sure the writers intended to have a message beyond \"the dead live on within you\" but can\u2019t justify it with enough evidence within the movie. It's also annoying to have both of his parents literally explain that \"the dead live on within you\" to Kubo in the middle of the movie and then have no nuance added through action by the end of the movie. \n\nI do see flashes of great story in here though. When Kubo prays to his parents, we see the part of the story that was heavily under-utilized in this movie; that Kubo is a storyteller that is aware that he is the hero in a story. Kubo laments that while this is a good ending overall, he can't help but feel sorrow as both his parents are still dead after he finally got to know them. Kubo in the beginning of the movie wanted to know more about his father, not just his deeds but his personality as well. And his father was surprisingly not a stern samurai, but a lovable goofball. Kubo in the beginning of the movie never truly had a mother, as he was the caretaker of his mother who fed her and made a living for their family. He finally gets a lucid version of his mother, and she nags him and is over protective. He finally gets to know and love these real versions of his parents and then they are suddenly taken away from him again. These are great subversions of his expectations of a Hero's Journey that aren't fully explored enough. This movie was begging for a bittersweet ending instead of the happy one that it got with the literal spirits of his parents watching over him.\n\nIn my opinion, the correct ending for Kubo is dead obvious. Kubo's prayers aren't met and he doesn't see his parent's spirits. Later, Kubo is in the market square again, finally performing the ending of his play for the villagers. Except this time, he talks about the personalities of his heroes instead of their deeds. He immortalizes his parent's spirit through his actions because they are truly gone. His stories have changed because he's lived through them and he's matured as a storyteller. He finally knows how stories end; bittersweet.\n\n", "Went to Universal Studios in California a few days ago and my girlfriend and I saw an exhibit for Laika films. We went in and were privileged enough to see original sets from their movies. From the pink mansion in Coraline, to Normans bedroom (including his monster slippers) from Paranorman, to where the Box Trolls slept. The most impressive set however was the large paper mache/origami orange boat from the movie Kubo. The amount of detail put into this was amazing.

The trailers were nothing short of amazing ([the third one in particular still gives me chills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9tDqmOPmto)) and the story promised to be mature, epic and breathtaking. To say the least, I was fucking pumped for this movie.\n\nSo I went and saw it last night, and had a complete blast. Is it a perfect film? No. Were my expectations set way too high? Probably. But it's still an excellent film (especially in terms of its story, characters, and animation) and one of the best movies of the year so far without a doubt. And for that, I strongly recommend it.\n\nBut just as important, I urge everyone to go see this movie not just because it's an awesome movie but to support animation like this. There seriously needs to be more animated films like this in the West.", "I liked that they didn't just resort to getting revenge and ending it there.", "As if the movie wasn't spectacular enough, here come the credits.

Goatee, ponytail and everything, and when he was Beetle, he was masterful at bow and arrow!\n", "I went to an advance screening. My expectations were low, but they shouldn't have been. This is a masterfully made film with some of the best stop motion, a great cast, brilliant score and story that echos Pixar's finest. Best of all, it's highly enjoyable for adults and has a truly meaningful message. The movie is quite dark tonally though, so it may be suited for slightly older audiences.

The animation was phenomenal and creative, the characters especially Monkey was extremely expressive, the story for the majority was good and the attention to detail in Japanese aesthetics was refreshing. I highly recommend Kubo and the Two Strings and the other films LAIKA has produced over the years. \n\nSome other random thoughts:\n\n\u2022 The movie takes place and was released during the Obon season. I wonder if it was intentional or just coincidence? I'm also quite pleased how well they described what Obon is....Though I don't remember if they even say the word.\n\n\n\u2022 Its nice that the depiction of Japanese culture is more or less immersive and not just a backdrop.\n\n\n\u2022 I heard that Kubo's mother's hair style and clothing were based on Heian period court attire. I wonder if she is also a subtle nod to the character Princess Kaguya? The tale of the bamboo cutter takes place during the Heian period and Kaguya herself was from the moon.\n\n\n\u2022Since rabbits and the moon go hand in hand in Japanese culture I felt they kind of missed an opportunity in not adding any as some sort of spy. But I understand the man in the moon is more relatable to it's intended audience than rabbits.\n\n\n[Spoiler](#s \"  The foreshadowing of both Kubo's parents is interesting. Origami Hanzo leads Kubo and Monkey; the reincarnation of Kubo's mother to Beetle who later is revealed to be the real Hanzo/ Kubo's father. It's even more interesting if not bittersweet that Beetle's immediate attraction to Monkey is similar to the time they first met as humans.\")\n\n\n\u2022 Kubo's grandfather's name is Raiden who is the god of thunder and lighting. He is also associated with the tomoe/drum symbol which now makes sense why the two aunts would have the crest on their chest armor.", "Great movie. Way better than I thought it would be.\n\nPros:\n\n- The first act is just fantastic. Surprisingly slow, subtle, and emotional.\n\n- Beautiful to look at. There are CG backgrounds, but almost everything else is legitimate stop-motion. I was never uncertain as to what was real or not.\n\n- Great soundtrack. I especially loved the track that played during Monkey's story. And of course the credits song.\n\n- The second act is really funny. It made me laugh a lot, and all the jokes landed.\n\n- The ending is very emotional and somber, which is admirable for this kind of movie.\n\nCons:\n\n- The second act is honestly TOO funny. The humor doesn't play to the strengths of the movie. The first act does a fantastic job of getting you invested, so the rest of the movie is certainly engaging, but the movie would have been a lot better without so many jokes.\n\n- There are some parts toward the end that are pretty over-dramatic and corny. But this is kind of a nitpick.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this movie. It feels very different from most animated movies. The first act alone makes the whole thing worth it.", "This film is honestly one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The animation, to the cinematography, and the music (my god that end credits song) are breathtaking. I have been anticipating this movie since I saw a trailer in theaters months ago, and even with all the positive reviews and the 96% on RT, I was still blown away after seeing it. The story was great imo, certainly held up to it's beautiful animation and there was nothing I could dislike.\n\n[Spoiler](/s \"The enemies were terrifying. I didn't know the sisters had masks until one broke towards the end, so I thought they were just speaking without moving their lips! (Yikes)...The skeleton and the underwater eyes were also horrifying, and I can't imagine not being terrified if I was a child haha. (goddamn that skeleton rig they showed during the credits...insane).\")\n\nI loved all the choices for the voices, Matthew McConaughey was hilarious, I also didn't realize the one villager was George Takei until he said \"Oh myy!\" and I audibly gasped in the theater.\n\nTLDR; this movie is 1000% worth seeing in theaters, and sit through some of the credits just to hear that lovely cover of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\"", "This was the best animated film I think I've ever seen.  My wife and I took our niece to see it.  I didn't know anything about it, we went in blind debating whether to go to Pete the Dragon or Kubo.  Thank goodness we chose Kubo.  I was blown away from the opening scene to the closing scene.  It is a beautiful movie and it has soul and a great story.  \n\nOne thing I would be a little careful of is how old your child is. Our niece is four and she was fine with the movie but I kept looking down at her to make sure she wasn't getting scared because when you meet the sisters they scared me!  But when I looked down at my nieces face she just had her furrowed brow going and was ready to fight with Kubo and she loved it.\n\nWhen we got home my niece and I played a new game called Kubo.  We both have three string mandolins and have adventures going across the sea of snakes (kitchen hardwood floor), to the mountains of the king ogre (stairs), to the cave of Giant ravens (a spare room) that we get a treasure from.  When my wife came in and asked what we were doing my niece called her a witch and to be careful as the witch could cause us to turn to stone. (Wife rolls eyes here). Luckily we put on magic wings for one another and flew away before the witch caught us!  :)\n\nGreat movie, I would say if your child scares easily be wary as this movie was captivating as an adult and has some scary parts. I liked this better than How to catch a dragon, Up,   Incredibles, pretty much all my top animated movies.  Great job to the people who worked on it.", "Ohhhh boy this is not going to make me popular but I had major issues with the emotional beats in the story. I saw it on a whim tonight after seeing the good reviews.\n\n{Spoilers}\n\nFirst off, none of this criticism reflects the visuals or sound/music work. They were fucking incredible and I recommend the movie on them alone. This was just a beautiful, beautiful movie. \n\nThe story though fails at crucial junctures, which is shocking for a movie about storytellers. Kubo is clearly playing to classic hero's journey archetypes but fails to either fulfill the narrative or reject it (it just sort of... happens). In short, Kubo gets a call of adventure, finds two mentors (who happen to be his parents in disguise), loses them, and... tries to fight a dragon/fish/moon thing? Uh.. here is how it should have happened.\n\nSo the movie is great until his mother sacrifices herself 15 or so minutes in, ignites his magic robe, and he flees to safety. Wakes up to Monkey. Finds out she is his guardian and he must find the magic armor of his father to protect himself from the Moon King. Good so far.\n\nExcept, in the hero's journey, Kubo has to REJECT the call to adventure. And it makes perfect sense why. He just lost his mom! Like, the one person he cared and loved in the entire world. He has to actually miss her (which he never actually does in the movie bizarrely) which will make Monkey's later reveal that much more meaningful. \n\nOk so Kubo rejects the call, something attacks them, action sequence, he uses his power of his strings to fight it off and finds a clue about his father. This ties it back into the themes of parents in the movie and gives an emotional connection back to the film - his mother may be gone but his father might still be alive! The little origami Hanzo guy arrives and we're back on track. \n\nMovie back on same track. Meet Beetle, playful Beetle to Monkey banter, fight skeleton, pull out sword. Good. Go out to the lake. Bonding moment with all three eating fish (which was good in film as is). They see underwater armor. Beetle goes in. Does NOT get confused (which was stupid) but gets hypnotized. Kubo goes in to save him, Monkey fights her sister, same same, Kubo gets the armor on and Beetle wakes up and saves him. Monkey kills sister but is badly injured. Kubo DOES NOT realize she is his mother (too early). Instead, when hypnotized, he has a vision sent by the Moon King to to his father's castle where his father is waiting. \n\nThe three continue on, have the discussion about the golden condors (another beautiful sequence as is), with the dying Monkey being very wistful. They reach the ruined castle, and it's a trap! Second sister arrives, gives Monkey a fatal wound, then SHE reveals BOTH PARENTS at once. Bam, you have a double impact. The family he thought was lost and was searching for was with him all along. Beetle, knowing he is Hanzo and wanting to protect his son, sacrifices himself to kill the second sister. Both give their tearful goodbye, and die. Kubo is alone.\n\n**This is the key to the entire film. Kubo has to feel those loses once and for all. He had already started to accept them, given in to hope at least his father still lived, then lost them for good just as they were found. He has lost everything, and is vulnerable to the Moon King's temptations now.**\n\nThis is important. In the movie as is he is never really tempted by his grandfather (which misses the entire internal arc of the character!) and never shows any real pain or lose for his parents, even temporarily. If he feels that pain it makes more sense for him to see the location of the helmet back in his old village as the hell and want to finish the mission for them. \n\nHe returns to the village, dons the helmet, and his armor set is complete. The Moon King arrives, and sees a silly little boy in a suit of ill fitting armor. He laughs, knocking Kubo around. The armor has no power at all. Everything his parents told him was a lie. Now the Moon King can tempt him fully. Wouldn't it be great to feel no pain? No anguish at death? Feel nothing at all? Give up his other eye and join him in the heavens. Leave the humans to their messy, stupid lives and deaths.\n\n*And Kubo actually considers it. Feeling nothing would be better than the pain in his heart.*\n\n**But then he sees the two strings around his wrist - his mother's hair and father's bow string. And he knows they aren't dead, because nothing ever really dies. It just becomes something else. He learns that crucial lesson from his parents talk about the golden condors.**\n\nNow he is ready to become a hero in his own right. His mother killed one sister. His father the one. He'll have to defeat his grandfather alone. He grabs his instrument, re-strings it with those two strings and his own, and plays. The ancestors from the village return, and push back against the Moon King. His armor lights up. The power was in him all along not in the armor, yada yada. \n\nThe Moon King is worried as he is beaten back by the strings. The Kubo plays one last time, and his parents return at last in their true forms. They defeat the Moon King together. Before they fade they tell him they love him and that he'll grow into the armor soon. Then they fade into the morning light. The end.\n\nSame basic movie structure, just with the character beats in more emotional areas. I'll point out that Pixar/Disney has become a master at figuring out those sort of story beats (which is why their movies are so fucking good lately and tear inducing). Kubo got close, but the script let those amazing visuals down in the end for me. ", "Brilliant.  I hope it wins best picture", "I think the biggest thing I noticed was how well the movie was lit.  Most animated movies end up with super flat, blown out lighting, even with advances in CG.  It may be because it was stop-motion and used actual lighting setups but the movie was never afraid to go dark (visually and with the story).  The late afternoon sunsets were stunning too.  Probably the best lit animated movie I've seen in a while.  Up there with the How to Train Your Dragon films. ", "Why did the Kubo's grandfather become human and lose his memory? I didn't understand that part.", "The animation in this was beyond fantastic. Really one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.\n\nBut the story was very lacking. The first part was fine, but it started to fall apart when his mother gives him wings. Why wouldn't one of the aunts fly after him instead of both going for the mom? And if she just used *all* her magic, it should have been easy to defeat her then go after him. \n\nAnd then there's one of my biggest problems: Origami Hanzo. There was no rhyme or reason for him. We were going off the idea that this was Kubo's father's spirit come to guide him. But then we learn that Hanzo isn't dead. So what on earth was that origami Hanzo and how did it know where to go? That was poorly done.\n\nThis brings us to Beetle. This world is so underdeveloped. Apparently Kubo's father was just a quick little flight away the whole time. Kubo's random flight path brought him to a snowy mountain where his father just so happened to be living. And what's more is that they bump into each other and decide to team up. All of that is extremely tenuous and unbelievable.\n\nThe Moon God was hardly developed at all, but his redemption was the resolution of the whole film. It wasn't fitting. Much better would have been he becomes mortal but keeps his memory. It was also dumb how the armor was lauded as being able to make a man stronger than the gods, but when Kubo gets the armor the Moon God brushes it off with a finger. That one swoop essentially made 80% of the movie irrelevant.\n\nAll the locations are so close to each other. Travel time is a joke. When they park the boat, it stays there seemingly for hours without an anchor.\n\nI appreciated the poignancy of the part where Kubo restrings the shamisen, but it made me feel like none of these people have ever played a stringed instrument. Everyone knows that (her) hair is neither long, thick, nor sturdy enough to string up a guitar with.\n\nI enjoyed the film because of the visuals, but the story left much lacking.", "Just got out of this. On one hand, I really enjoyed watching it. The character interactions were absolutely amazing, the visuals were splendid, and the soundtrack was an absolute treat. The subjects tackled in the production, let alone the level of maturity that they're dealt with, is something that you don't really see in animated films too often.\n\nAt the same time, however, I felt that the plot moved along a little too briskly. Really, this is a common issue with animated movies across every studio, but I felt that this film really needed to be longer, moreso than other movies in recent memory due to just how many moving parts there were in the plot. I think, because of how much was going on, it felt like it hit its plot points a little too quickly or that certain elements of foreshadowing just went by way too quickly. I also felt that Kubo himself was somewhat of a flat character - his growth, if any, didn't really feel organic and he was more of a vessel to tell the story. Things just kind of...happened.\n\nEven still, I think this is the kind of movie that will probably get better upon multiple viewings and I want to see it again to pick up on things I may have missed.", "I'm so damn conflicted about this movie. On one hand, I absolutely LOVE the message they were going for and the themes about loss and memory that they string (no pun intended) throughout the film. That third act is pretty great.\n\nBut on the other hand...it all feels so rushed! The story moves way too fast, and some of the plot points barely make sense. For example: making Monkey and Beetle actual, reincarnated versions of his parents fits thematically, but plot-wise it feels like too much of a leap. Once we're given that information, we aren't given enough time to process it before moving on to the next big plot point!\n\nI really want to love this movie, but the story problems keep getting in the way. I feel like an extra 20 minutes could have given the story a lot more room to breathe, but I know that's a lot to ask when the animation is so intensive.\n\nAnd my god, that animation!", "I feel conflicted. There is undeniable artistry in both the visuals and the music. Voice acting was solid. However, the plot left me unsatisfied. Spoilers. \n\nFirst, the three items were basically useless for the \"boss fight\" for which they were needed. The movie also glossed over too quickly at the loss of major characters. Finally, the final act was disjointed. Nonetheless, it was beautiful to look and the skill of the crew is undeniable. And the Regina Spektor rendition at the closing credits was sublime.

I loved the amount of detail and work that went into making this movie.  That alone is worth the price of admission.  However, the ending didn't sit well with me; the Moon King needed to be developed more to earn that type of an ending for him.  Additionally they could've had Kubo tell a longer story incorporating the back stories of the legendary sword, armor, and how the helmet all ended up in those particular \"places\".  Overall this movie will leave you wanting more when you leave the theatre, which isn't a bad thing.  I'd give it a 6.5 out of 10.", "Lovely film. Has to be one of my favourites of this year.

Perhaps someone else can clear things up for me?\n\n* Why did the mother sit and stare all day and only mentally wake for a couple of hours at night?\n* Why did she choose to become a monkey? And when, given we saw her fighting her sisters as he flew away?\n* Why was she so much more lucid as a monkey?\n* Why did Kubo not recognise his mother's voice immediately?\n* Why did she lie to Kubo so extensively, and how can the \"trust in your parents\" theme be used when this occurs?\n\nI really liked the mirroring of his parents relationship in their second meeting to their first, the gradual thawing of relations.\n\nI found the climax was particularly heavy-handed and really came out of left field. His realisation of why his grandfather wanted his eyes was fairly nonsensical without the fairly large logic jump that his quest was about the journey, not the armour. But there's so much positive storyline imbued in the armour that I find this hard to reconcile. \n\nThe very end was ashes in my mouth; the blatant religious overtones in what could easily have been left alone. It really, really bugs me when people make up stories to make themselves feel better, when the truth would have served so much better. It would have been a much stronger conclusion and a lesson not to lie to your children; they are stronger than you believe.", "Went with my two kids (6 and 7).

My daughter is a stop motion fanatic, and she had been going crazy over it since the first trailer was released. We went yesterday afternoon and I am so sad that we were the ONLY people inside the theater. It really drove home how little attention Kubo is getting. And our theater is shiny and new and usually packed with advanced seating required. Even for the most lame movies. It was a wonderful film that we all enjoyed, although it stuck to a pretty familiar story line.

Loved it!", "[removed]", "That was probably the most creative and interesting story I've seen in an \"animated kids movie\" in a long time.

The graphics were amazing and the background breathtaking. The story on the other hand, not so much.\n\nI loved that this entire movie was implied to be a story told by Kubo, since in the movie it was said that Monkey, or rather, Mother's story would never die since it would be told by Kubo to others who would then tell it again and again and again.\n\nApart from that, I found the second half lacking in the story department because of the lack of smooth transition. When Kubo arrived at the village and I saw the villagers hiding, I thought they weren't real and were an illusion because, why are they still there? Shouldn't they have run away already? Didn't two or three days, if not more pass when Kubo and his parents were in the Farlands? They should have been gone...or dead.\n\nAnyways, then the ending with the lanterns and Raiden's redemption got me by surprise. I did not expect his redemption at all, since the sisters were killed. The ending felt really off with no main focus, as if they had no idea how to end the story. Then, Kubo with the lanterns and his parents made me confused again, because I had no clear idea of the timeframe. He was talking to them and then the next scene was just the end. If they had managed to expand on the ending, I think this movie would have been perfect. \n\nIn conclusion, the graphics were amazing, the story faltered in the second half and the ending was meh. In addition, the music was above average as well. The title of the movie was very symbolic and fitting.

Throughout the movie they made the typically brave choices I'd expect from this studio. Monkey & Beetle died and the film moved onward. Kubo's mother died and he didn't grieve much (almost to a fault). Point being, it wasn't like the occasional unearned Pixar death. However, the ending felt cliched and contrived for me. From the old passed peoples manifesting as orange glowing silhouettes, to Kubo's parents just showing up next to him at the end, it felt a little cheap. It took away from the realities of death and the importance of stories living on, and replaced it with more of \"everything will be okay\" than a meaningful lesson learned. I would have been fine with the lanterns lighting up only; that would have kept with the theme and stayed away from the odd and occasionally confusing ending. Furthermore, the second act had too many jokes; Kubo's mother died essentially fighting away his grave fate and there was no sign of safety, yet the jokes piled on and on. I understand that since children are part of the target audience it is necessary to lighten the mood, but it was at odds with the rest of the movie. That being said,\") the animation was absolutely breathtaking and the music throughout was impeccable. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to someone on that basis alone. The beginning of the film was excellent, and there was no shortage of great set pieces. ", "My 11 year old daughter enjoyed the movie very much, it was a bit too scary for my 6 year old. I found the movie somewhat confusing, frustrating to watch. The dialogue was a struggle for me, I found the convo between Monkey and Beetle very unnatural and not one bit entertaining. But the biggest problem I had was the actual story. **Spoiler Alert** Why would the Mom have a baby with this warrior guy when she fully understood the consequences. I mean, she was supposed to kill the guy, right? He is like the worst enemy of the family. Through her actions and decisions, she got herself killed, her husband killed, and caused her son to suffer the loss of an eye in addition to being in constant danger for the rest of his life. Seems the Mom is the stupid one in the movie, her actions causing a wave of destruction to herself and everyone she loved including her future son. Why would a women do that to herself and future family... for love? Was the love really worth dying for and her son to lose and eye and suffer all his life? I don't get that part of the story which was not elaborated on at all. The problem is that this movie is an animation with some very serious themes of life and death which are far too complex for kids to understand. It's far too scary for very young kids. My 6 year old was almost in tears.  Great visuals. But who is the intended audience? It's an animation only adults would fully understand.. and I don't know many adults that want to watch an animated movie to learn about life lessons through the eye of a 10 year old kid whose harrowing situation is caused by parents who either can't control their emotions or don't fully understand the consequences of their actions. Is love what saves Kubo? No, it's love that caused him to lose his eye and to be in constant danger all his life.

Turning the Moon King mortal and giving him amnesia felt so sudden and unexplained and it felt....really fucked up the villagers feed him lies. It didn't feel like much of a victory.

Get on it, Netflix!", "As some other people have noted, this film is a flawed masterpiece. It's truly a beautiful movie that tries to tackle timeless and very difficult themes, sometimes managing to do so well, sometimes missing the mark. Overall I thought it was fantastically well made, especially the beginning and end. The middle is kind of weak for me, and some things aren't explained terribly well. \n\nBig spoilers... \n\n\n\n\nThey don't explain how or why the pieces of armor got to where they found them. They don't explain why Kubo's mother turned into the monkey or his father turned into Beetle, specifically - the obvious explanation is that Moon Kingdom magic is involved, from the mother and her sisters, but not why those specific animals are chosen for those characters. They don't even explain why Kubo has the power over paper, or why his mother could do that, but the Moon King and the moon-Sisters couldn't. Overall I felt like this is a movie that needed to maybe have another act added in the middle of it to flesh out some of the world and to do more stuff with the characters. For how few characters are in this movie - it's basically Kubo, Monkey, and Beetle for most of it - we don't see a ton of development from any of these characters. One common criticism of the film is that Kubo has no real development as a character because he has no flaws. I definitely felt like they could have shown him frustrated over his lot in life a bit, and in a place where he needs to come to terms with the more unfortunate parts of his story - I mean he's only got one eye, he's basically been orphaned after the start of the movie only to find out his traveling companions are his reincarnated parents only to have them immediately ripped away - but they were maybe too scared of making the character whiny and annoying, alienating audiences. Perhaps one of the best elements of this movie is the way it's self-aware that it's dealing with the nature of story-telling as one of its themes, and you see little nods in the film to the audience that don't break the fourth-wall but that certainly seem to say \"yeah, this is about the movie you're currently watching,\" which I thought was nice. I think I'll have more thoughts on this in the future, especially after a second screening.)", "This movie was almost devoid of humor, or if something was funny, it was more wry than slapsticky...I think that's pretty ballsy, especially in an animated film intended for children.

Character designs, music, world design, animation, action. It felt like the video game 'Okami' - I loved the action sequences involving the giant skeleton and the boat. \n\nBut man, that screenplay was rubbish. Just as things get really interesting with the sisters and the death of the mother, the film grinds to a halt and just dawdles around as the Monkey and the Beetle get introduced. Why was so much time spent on Kubo and Monkey just bickering and messing about?? It really slowed the movie down and became boring. For some reason the monkey character acts hostile to everyone, and they need to get these three plot things, just 'cause? Then it turns out those three things didn't matter, and they just needed the power of love. The villain doesn't get introduced until very late in the plot, and then his motivations are jumbled and inconsistent. We only hear about him in vague terms, when the film should have depicted him in a prologue or something. And then when they defeat him, he turns into a man and they start lying to him about his life. What? And what was with the dialogue about stories, and \"NO! Every story has an end!\" What was that?? That whole exchange made ZERO sense. And they said something about people living on in stories and memories, but then they live on in lanterns and the spirit realm as well, so not sure what was happening there. This film was just confusing af - like they had all these different themes and symbols and motifs they wanted to portray, but had no idea how to tie them together in a coherent narrative.

The pacing was ploddingly simple, rotating between Exposition Scene and Action Scene without any kind of deviation, and to make it more pronounced every single scene was uniform in length; they could have been in a different order without disrupting very much.\n\nThe main character is Kubo, but as the secondary characters appear he has less and less to do, until he's merely luggage to be transported until the very end.\n\nThe imagery was great.

Snow, water, grass... it was all perfect, and visually it was a joy to watch. \n\nCons: given the animation style, close up shots of the characters led to some awkward facial patterns. The beginning was a bit slow, and I felt that maybe the movie went a bit too deep with the ancient Japanese symbolisms. I felt like they kept trying to shove them down my throat. The magical guitar isn't really consistent.

There were no iPhones or laptops or really anything that gave this movie a specific time frame. \n\n-DID THEY SHOW A KID PICKING AND EATING WILD MUSHROOMS IN A MOVIE FOR KIDS? \n\n-Elliot was beautifully done and I'm so thrilled they didn't do some Game Of Thrones / Reign Of Fire type dragon and instead went with something so lovable and warm. Elliot was a giant dog with wings. \n\n-Karl Urban's character was probably the most difficult to swallow in this movie, he stretches the whole range of character emotions only to give us that knowing nod and smile at the end on the bridge... (I don't think this is Urban's fault, more so the fault of the script). \n\n-Loved how the movie went full circle, opening with Pete's parents tragedy in the car and ending with Pete's new family going on an adventure. \n\n-Thrilled they had Oona sing (Natalie), she starred in Matilda on Broadway and has a gorgeous voice. \n\n-Oakes was a great Pete and really helped to make the movie so great. \n\n-I felt like there were more to certain characters sub plots but they were left on the cutting room floor. \n\n", "This is how all remakes should be. Take an absolute garbage movie from the past with an interesting premise and turn it into a great movie. Take notes Sony.", "Pete's Dragon  \nSausage Party  \n\nGreat weekend to watch a couple movies about dicks. ", "Man this movie is just so...optimistic? There isn't a cynical bone in its body.\n\nI really, *really* liked this. Definitely teared up a few times.\n\nThe pros: \n\n* Loved the design of Elliot. The idea to go fur instead of scales helped him immediately stand apart from a large canon of dragons (especially kids dragons). It made it a bit more believable that he's basically a giant dog. \n\n* Some people are citing bad CGI but I thought it ranged from \"Acceptable\" to \"Great\". Never once lost immersion from the special effects.\n\n* Solid acting, especially from the young boy who plays Pete. Just like in this year's \"The Jungle Book\" this movie could have been absolutely sunk by a bad lead, since so much of the movie just features only him (well, and Elliot). I'd even go so far to say that he was better than the three adult leads of Howard, Urban, and Bentley (through no fault of their own). Redford was really great though. His little speech about magic in the middle of the movie could ha e very easily come across as cheesy, trite nonsense. His performance there is so genuine though.\n\n* I liked the touch of timelessness in the movie. It's pretty hard to really pinpoint when the movie takes place, except that it's pre cell phone. And even then, if the characters did have cell phones, the story would pretty much still stand.\n\n* I think I liked the subtlety of the environmentalism theme. I was worried it was going to be a bit heavy handed when I learned that Howard is a park ranger and Urban was the miller and shaping up to be the antagonist. It would have been neat to see a little bit of exploration of that dichotomy, but it wasn't too bad. I loved the shot of that big fat old af tree getting torn down in the fight to capture Elliot. \n\nThe cons\n\n * It drags a touch in the second act. It felt like there were a few extra scenes know the cutting room floor, as the three adult leads felt a bit flat. I feel like the aforementioned tension between BDH and Urban should have been more explored, as well as the relationship between the two brothers. There is clear symmetry between BDH and Pete, SS they both lost their mothers when they were 5. And Natalie was without a mother. I just feel like there are some really cool things *just* outside of the scope of this story.\n\n* I think that editing undercut the characters of the three main adults. Karl Urban was a bit all over the place, and he's a good actor. I don't think that was his fault. Bentleys character was barely even a character, he just sort of existed to bridge relationships between Urban, BDH, and Natalie.\n\n* The action wasn't the most exciting. I know you can't really have a ton of peril in your action of you're aiming to make a movie that five year olds can enjoy. So I don't really know how they could ha e done it better.\n\nOverall, I really liked the movie.", "I was never a fan of the original, but I really liked this one. Sweet and heartfelt, but in a way that's genuine and not artificial. The score and production values are both top-notch and the performances were great (Oakes Fegley was really good as Pete). I loved the effects for Elliott.", "This movie was beautiful.", "I was very reluctant to watch this movie. But thankfully the family wanted to go so I said \"Why not?\".\n\nI loved it. I *love* Elliott! I love his design and his overall personality. It was a really cute and heartfelt movie. It far exceeded my expectations. I'm glad I got to see this.\n\nBut what confused me is how he doesn't know what a window/ballon is and had a Tarzan-esque attitude. He was 4/5 years old when he entered the forest right? I would assume a 5 year old would remember balloons. But that's just me being my cynical self.", "I liked it! This is coming from someone who has never seen the original, so no nostalgia or anti-nostalgia from me.\n\nCons\n\n- Why the hell did the kid not know what a sandwich, balloon, phone, or dog was? They made him out to be a kid Tarzan\n\n-Lots of dumb kid movie moments, like the complete lack of peripheral vision when the Dragon is literally right outside the window or above them\n\n-Cheesy ending, but it was cute\n\n-Same dumbed down feeling that kid movies used to have. With stuff like Inside-Out and Zootopia, I guess I forgot that kid movies can be this shallow\n\nPros\n\n-Pretty good CGI on the Dragon\n\n-Cute story that was fairly entertaining, actually liked it better than Finding Dory or Secret Life of Pets\n\n-I thought the bridge scene was legitimately bad-ass, I actually forgot that Dragons breathe fire, so it was a nice twist I suppose\n\n-Kid actors were not bad at all, I thought they did a good job\n\nIt was better than Suicide Squad, if you have a sibling, child, etc. I think they will love it like my brother and sister did.

I watched both D&D movies because they had dragons in them (Don't act like you don't watch shitty movies that have actors you like in them). The last dragon I saw in the theaters was Eragon. Yeah, lucky me huh? By chance I was in the US when it premiered nationally. So I went because I wastes gonna cheat myself out of seeing a dragon movie in the big screen because \"its for children\" like I did in 2010. So yeah, it was good. The kid actor did a great job, good child actors are few-and-far-between. Elliot was a lot easier to take seriously now that he's not a caricature (Literal, go watch the 1977 version). The score was nice, although at times it seemed to blend into the background. A solid watch, go take your kids to see it. Its just a wholesome movie, inoffensive but not bland. If you're a weirdo like me the dragon wont disappoint.", "It was good, for what it was. \n\nRobert Redford did a far better job than he had too--not much gruffness, and a lot of heart. \n\nOakes Fegley and Oona Laurence did surprisingly decent jobs for newcomers--Fegley in particular impressed me. \n\nBut I wasn't particularly impressed with any of the other adults. There was a level of flatness there. True the adults weren't cartoony, but there wasn't much depth to them either. The rivalry between Jack and Gavin could have been interesting but might as well not have been there.\n\nThe sets were good--which gives the story a timeless feel, despite it likely being a timepiece. That is definitely a nod in its favor.\n\nElliott's visual effects were impressive. It wasn't as photo-realistic as Pixar or Jungle Book, but it still works fine. Better even, Elliott is a bit more muted, which fits the forest he lives in well. \n\nIt definitely isn't worth the 3-D, but it's still a nice, little film.", "This movie was great. I cried so much.

It was OK, maybe worth a few laughs. I'll hate a little here--with honesty at least--and say the dialogue was horribly repetitive, almost ostentatious. That being said, the story line was decent but also slightly lackluster in certain areas. It wasn't funny to watch innocent unearned deaths from the various foods (including one of the main characters, Carl) but it was funny to watch them engage in crude, vulgar dialog--to an extent. \n\nAll in all, if you like sex jokes and vulgarity, you'll probably be happy you watched Sausage Party, but also get a little fed up halfway through.

I knew going into it that there was going to be a lot of raunchy humor so it wasn't like I didn't know what I was getting into or was offended, I just found it really boring. They kept recycling some of the same jokes (like the \"just the tip\" joke) that just weren't funny in the first place and that got pretty annoying. The novelty of animated food products swearing and making raunchy jokes wore off fairly early and it just felt so overdone by the end of the movie. To be fair there were a few parts I liked. I thought the gum was pretty funny as well as the scene parodying Saving Private Ryan but most of the jokes I just met with a blank face. I'll admit the orgy scene definitely caught me off guard and I  found it funny at first, but it just kept dragging on and by the end I just wanted it to be over so the movie could just end. Overall I expected Sausage Party to be a movie that would make me genuinely laugh out loud but only gave a me a few small chuckles and a lot of jokes that just weren't funny.", "No film since \"Team America: World Police\" has been this fucking *insane*.

Idk if it's me getting older or what but I just couldn't force myself to like this movie.", "This movie puts me in a very unusual position, as I enjoyed the film immensely but can't think of a single person I would recommend it to. I went into this movie expecting to see shocking images and racy jokes, and at least for me, it delivered. In particular, the food orgy and Stephen Hawking gum character had me in fits. It's clear that Rogen and Goldberg invested a lot of time in the douche character, but I thought the way he kept draining other bottles and growing progressively more terrifying was really cool to watch. This is the first movie this summer to completely deliver on the hype for me, and give me a pretty strong pro-atheist message to boot.\n\nHowever, I can totally understand why some, or even most, people might not enjoy the movie. It does rely heavily on the \"isn't it crazy we're showing this in an animated movie\" schtick, and if you're not a fan of racist stereotypical humor, I can easily see how you would be put off by large portions of this film. \n\nUltimately, I rate this movie highly because the humor works for me, and because the idea is undeniably original.

Some of y'all are so offended at it's appeal to lowbrow humor and ankle deep satire that you can't appreciate it for what it is. It's a well made film. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's a pretty good one anyhow. I can't think of a single moment where the film felt like it was dragging for me. There are a lot of true classics that can't claim that. Is this movie an award winner? No. But did I find myself suspending my disbelief and caring about the characters and Frank's odyssey? Yes, yes I did, and any film that can do that and keep me there for the entire ride is, in my book, a good movie. The orgy payoff was, yes, cringey (my GF held her eyes shut for most of it), but it was entertaining precisely because the main characters had some personality to them, and the themes of sexual tension, temptation, and religious chastity are brought up throughout the film. Seth Rogen basically made a textbook by the numbers film and did a marvelous job executing it. You might not LIKE the movie, but I feel the mechanics of the thing are sound.", "I liked it. It entertained me and I enjoy the fact that it offends people who I think should be offended.

I guess a lot of Seth Rogan movies are sort of like this, but this one just felt really, really not funny.\n\nMost of the humor, like 80% is based on racial stereotypes. Like, the movie is so fucking racist and bad, the kind of jokes kids who go to all white schools and have never met any minority group in person kind of jokes. There was even a part where the fruits were fighting a black guy and legit got out a FUCKING LYNCH... they used it on his feet but even still. Oh, and I guess nazi jokes are still a thing. \n\nAlso there are several rape jokes and even rape... scenes??? Like one where a character literally forces himself on the juice box with a rip shaped like a vagina, sucks out the juices, then kills him and says if anyone asks he'll deny it. He also I guess attempts to rape the hot dog bun, makes several rape like comments, and he also shoves himself up that kids ass while saying \"a hole's a hole\" and saying \"You know we both want it\". And these scenes are supposed to be laughed at I guess? It made me cringe so bad. There was lots of sexual humor, which didn't really make me laugh at all but I guess I'm not as annoyed at that because we all knew it was gonna be that way from the trailer. The ending orgy scene was the one part that did make me laugh.\n\nThe story and plot was boring and uninteresting, and really really fucking slow. Lots of anti religion jokes that seemed unnecessary and weren't funny anyway (and I am an atheist).\n\nThe art too was just not good. There was no textures on anything. It looked like a cheap cg movie, like the ones that show up in redbox meant to mimic popular releases. Every character was very smooth. The hot dog bun and the bagel both were super smooth with a very dull shine. At the very least add some fucking texture to the main characters. They make fun of Pixar at a point by having a bumper sticker that says Dixar, you can't really make fun of them though when your movie looks so so low budget...\n\nAnyone ever heard of the movie Food Fight? Sausage Party reminded me so much of that movie in a really really bad way.\n\nEDIT: Throwing this in because a few have mentioned this in comments... I'm not saying that black comedies are not my thing. My issue is more the jokes on race being so uncreative and uninteresting, hence why I said it reminded me of white kids who've never met any non white kids writing the jokes.

Society has a lot of rules on what makes someone \"successful\" and \"functional,\" and that's shown with the neighborhood's/mother's attitude to the Aviator, who is actually a happy, reflective man despite hints of mental illness (hoarding, delusions, reclusive). In fact you could even argue the film portrays society excluding him *because of his mental illness/PTSD.   \nI can understand how some people didn't like the third act. But IMO, it depicts dealing with grief and loss. Violet finds herself literally seeing all of these characters her friend devised because she wanted to finish his story. She couldn't deal with the open-endedness of death. She couldn't imagine the prince just going into the sky and being gone forever and her fantasy was her only way of finding closure. Again, something I'm personally struggling with.  \nAll in all. I adored the animation despite it being kind of robotic looking at times. But the soundtrack was where this movie really shined.

Thankfully not long after Netflix said they'd take it and handle that part, so I finally got to experience it, and I felt it was phenomenal. I never actually read the story, so I didn't have much in the way of a springboard for expectations, but the animation was clean, characters were fine, separation of art styles was amazing, and plot was adorable. Everything about it was a positive. For me, anyway.", "I saw this last year and I cried thrice.

It's also a lovely story, and done really beautifully on the screen, particularly the scenes from the classic story.

The motion of the characters are realistic and the \"performance\" of the character of the little girl is amazing. Also there are wonderful old school stop-motion scenes that are visually stunning. Although there are some shots that could have worked better if done otherwise, the direction is beautiful and committed (you can tell that they really wanted to produce a great movie)\n\nAs for the voice work is also great, I was impressed for the voice acting of Mackenzie Foy, I think she showcased more her talent in Interstellar but you can explore more of it in this movie, in my case I really believed she was that character. Rachel McAdams also did an great work and Needless to say of the work of Jeff Bridges, he did a truly wonderful performance as the Aviator. The rest of the cast was great... too bad some of them had little dialogue such as Marion Cotillard and James Franco. I loved Ricky Gervais as The Conceited man, he was born for that role!\n\nA.

Also [the song composed for the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFpvu8EG-kQ) is really beautiful and fits to the theme, and I didn't know it was the same singer (Camille) who sang \"Le Festin\" in Ratatouille.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this movie, you don't need to read the books or know the story to understand it. \n\nI'd like to add that this movie is not only for children, Indeed is not even a comedy, but a drama (with comic elements obviously) but really no movie has touched my heart like this movie did since Hugo.\n\nThe only cons I could say is that sometimes it feels a little uneven, but also it's unexpected, just like in life.\n\nAnd I'd like to believe the girl really went to that adult planet.\n\nHope you enjoy it!", "I saw the reviews and saw you guys raving about it and went in not knowing a thing.

To be honest, I could relate to the little girl in almost every way (as someone with Asian parents and straight A's in high school), and in particular I'm the kind of personality that very much understands the vain struggle  find a neat conclusion or definite meaning, even when something is obviously meant to be senseless or open-ended. Also, I absolutely adored almost all the animation involving the stuffed fox, and really loved Paul Rudd as Mr. Prince, so I might be a little biased. :)\n\nIn any case, it's a movie with an incredible amount of heart and clearly had a lot of love, attention, and polish put into every minute of it.

I did NOT feel it was a good movie, or even average movie. I knew very little about the characters before the movie and very little after the movie was over, save their names.  When the movie started, I was blown away by the visuals.  Absolutely the best part of the movie.\n\nBut during their introduction to the characters, I felt it was too exposition heavy and still did not really understand what their powers were.  Does harley quinn have super human powers?  Is she a skilled hand-to-hand fighter?  Why is she important to the group.  Why did they put killer croc in a sewer?  I don't understand.  When did villains get to make requests about what kind of cell they're put in.\n\nIt went from cool to starting to feel a late 90s vibe of comic book movies like \"Batman Forever\" .\n\nNone of the relationships felt earned.  I did not care about flagg or june moon.  The second she went rogue Waller should have just set her heart on fire and killed her.  I do not understand why the heart thing worked, but then it didn't work, but then it worked again.  He could have killed her in the beginning, which apparently has no affect on Moon at all. Like What? LOL  Why didn't the enchantress release her brother at the beginning after she possessed Moon?  Why wait until years later?\n\nI do not even understand Flagg's appeal in the group at all.  He was constantly getting overrun and captured by the bubble-head monsters.  He served no purpose other than trying to get his girlfriend back, which was a weak backstory.  He's like a super soldier or something?  Why does Waller want him?  He seemed like your standard soldier extra, to be honest.\n\nI did not care about the relationship quinn had with the joker and it did not feel real to me. It felt like I was watching some high school drama with the insecure girl who wanted to piss her parents off by hooking up with the school bad boy.  The joker seemed like your standard street thug #10 in another movie, but with makeup and annoying grunts and laughs.  The scene with him laying down in a room with the ornate knife decoration thing ruined him for me.  Who actually does that.  How is that an actual trait anyone would have in the real world, insane or otherwise?  I thought the DCEU was supposed to be gritty and realistic.\n\nI liked El Diablo, but his character should have been explored more.  He was the only believable guy to me.  The other \"bad guys\" were not internally consistent with their supposed beliefs.  They could have easily broken a cell phone.  Hell, deadshot could have destroyed it with one shot while it was sitting in her pocket.\n\nAbout halfway in, the visuals couldn't salvage it anymore for me.  I was totally bored and wanting it to be over.  So apparently their mission was to rescue Waller from one room in the building and escort her to the roof where some other team was going to evac her out?  LOL wut?  Then, after sharing almost no chemistry, the group decides to take on an outmatched set of villians who are susceptible to small bombs?  Boys, we have missles that can do that.  And if a bomb could stop her machine (one that needed to be triggered by a bullet? LOL), we have missles for that too. \n\nIn fact, where was the military during all that?  At the very least you would have the type of military presence we saw in Godzilla.  But they were like, \"Nope. Waller, if you say a guy with a boomerang and another guy with ropes can fix this, we won't even try.\"\n\nNo Wonder Woman?  No Flash?  Hundreds of people dying and no response from anyone.

He laughs sometimes, but doesn't crack wise, and seems to be unable to take a joke. It's a little too far in the other direction from Ledger, Hamill, and Nicholson. Joker is supposed to be funny. Even if it's not funny to us it should be funny to HIM. \n\n3. The Suicide Squad (and DC films in general) needed a smaller, scaled back, more localized threat. Not another \"world ending machine muahahaha!\" Enchantress was a bad choice of villain for their first (and maybe last) outing.\n\n4. Dialogue was very stilted in a lot of scenes, leading to bad delivery from good actors.\n\n5. Croc's voice was TOO filtered and inhuman.

No you aren't friends and no you aren't family actually you're all supposed to be evil villians except the most evil person in the movie was Waller.

This movie felt too campy also cutting away from the gore and murder just to keep it pg-13 when the movie would have been so much better as a R rating. If they wanted a good example of bad, evil men working together they should have looked at The Usual Suspects for some motivation. None of the suicide squad was selfish or necessarily bad.

He had some good dialogue (not a lot of that otherwise), cool scenes and a proper backstory. We get to know him and understand his motivations, even if they\u2019re shoehorned down our throats at points. (We get it, he\u2019s doing it for his daughter)  \n- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She puts in a good performance with a shitty script and she\u2019s interesting. However it feels a bit too much like she was written to become a \u201cclassic portrayal\u201d. As if the WB execs demanded she be memorable by adding as many quirky lines and scenes as possible. Even before the movie came out people were proclaiming that \u201cI can tell her performance will be remembered for a long time\u201d. Overall good but could have been so much better.  \n- Jai Courtney as Boomerang. Supporting role fit him really well. Good comedic relief but he should have been the only one. Instead every character had to have a few one-liners to make the movie \u201cfunnier\u201d.  \n- Amanda Waller. Best parts were unfortunately in the trailers but she was still convincing as the \u201cevil\u201d commander doing whatever is necessary.   \n\n\n**The Bad**  \n- Extremely sloppy editing. Scenes felt like they were thrown together at random at times. Sudden cuts to flashbacks and tonal shifts made for a jerky a experience.  \n- The team becoming friends did not feel earned. Diablo sacrificed himself for his \u201cnew family\u201d and Quinn killed Enchantress because she messed with her friends. Where did all of that come from? Was it all because of that very forced bar scene that came out of nowhere?  \n- Joker was interesting but needed way more screentime or none at all. This in-between with random scenes could not establish the character properly. Like Harley Quinn he seemed to be written to be memorable, without earning it, by combining crazy outfits, tattoos, sets and dialogue along with sporadic laughing. His relationship with Quinn was also very underdeveloped and didn\u2019t explain why she loved him so much after he tortured her. Had some very cool visuals, like his ring of weapons or with Quinn in the bath, but they had no narrative backing.  \n- Why was Katana working with Waller and Flag? Very lazy flashback to establish her character!  \n- Killer Croc needed more screentime or should have been left out. Suffered from too many side characters.  \n- Diablo was cool but his best scene was shown in the trailer when he finally used his powers. Had a backstory that was suppose to be emotional but again the flashback didn\u2019t really fit in. At the end he had some kind of connection to Enchantress and Incubus but it wasn\u2019t explained. His \u201csuper skeleton form\u201d looked like really bad CGI.  \n- Enchantress was interesting in the beginning but not as the villain. Why did Waller just have her brother lying around? What was her plan, something about creating a machine? Why did they alter her voice so much? Why get such an inexperienced actress for the main villain?  \n- The idea of Batman arresting the villains was cool. But if they already had Batman and the Flash, why did they need a team of villains? Also the Flash has still not been introduced properly but shows up randomly yet again.  \n- In BvS Batman finds files about all the future Justice League members on a computer. At least that was used as foreshadowing for future movies, in this one that\u2019s how all the characters were introduced. Instead of introducing them in separate movies or showing us who they are, let\u2019s just have someone literally read a list with all their names and explain who they are to the audience.  \n- They needed the \u201cmetahumans\u201d to fight \u201cthe wars\u201d. What wars? Who were they fighting, Incubus only showed up after they were approved. Waller even called it WW3 but never explained what that was?\n- Also turns out everything could be fixed with explosives anyways. The Joker and Quinn escaping? Just shoot down their helicopter. (They survived but Waller seemed happy with it). Incubus messing you up? Just blow him up. Big generic light pillar destroying shit? Just blow it up!  \n- Who shot down their helicopter at the beginning? How did they survive without seatbelts and flipping over fifteen times?  \n- How did Waller survive her helicopter crash? How did she survive Enchantress tentacle things and show up just fine two minutes later?  \n- Why did they need to go rescue Waller in the first place? Why was she in a random room in the middle of the city when all the other military people were fine in their room somewhere else?  \n- As Boomerang said, why would any of them care about 10 years off their sentence?  \n- What happened to the \u201cmean guard\u201d?  \n- Why didn\u2019t the Joker just break into the prison from the start to get Quinn if he could do it at the end?\n- Deadshot and Quinn agreed to kill Flag and his men to escape. Two minutes later when Flag is getting killed by the monsters Deadshot tells Quinn to save him because \u201cif he dies we all die\u201d. But that was your plan just moments ago???  \n- The city setting was very bland and boring and it was so obvious they had removed all the people not to get flak like they did for MoS.  \n- The soundtrack had good songs but quite a few felt like they were just thrown in randomly. Gave me the feeling they were trying to do what Guardians of the Galaxy did so well with using established songs along with an orchestral score, so they just had to cram in enough pop songs for a full album into the movie.  \n- They honestly didn\u2019t really feel like villains. People kept telling us they were villains and the characters themselves loved reminding us about it but they never really showed it.", "For a movie where the characters kept saying they're the bad guys they really didn't show them do anything bad. \n\nIt's barely an ensemble movie. Harley, Deadshot and Flagg are the team. Diablo gets his scene or two even though the final fight was just a CG piece of shit. Katana, Boomerang and Killer Croc were entirely pointless and should have never been in the movie.\n\nEnchantress' dance moves are going to be a meme for the next week.\n\nWhy didn't they just make Joker the main villain?

Nobody cared about Diablo's sacrifice even though the movie tried to make it a big deal, but this soldier guy knowingly sacrificed himself by putting the bomb without guarantee that it would kill Enchantress' brother. And if I recall correctly it wasn't just a guy, it was like a whole team of soldiers. Was it the same guys that were traveling with them during the zombie ridden adventure quest to rescue the boss lady? I would've preferred to watch a movie about them and their story. It would have ended in a tragic sacrifice for humanity. And something that really bothered me was the scene in which Diablo is thinking back to when he killed his wife and children, he's holding his wife in his arms and crying. She's perfectly fine! Like, no burns or dirt or whatever from the fire. And then suddenly she just bursts into ashes just like that. Wtf? It was just something that really bothered me.

I LOVE comic book movies, and understand that there is absolutely nothing wrong being a \"mindless\" action movie. However, there comes a point where we have to stop supporting this... This movie is so remarkably lazy. Lazy editing, lazy script, lazy cinematography. I will admit that the actors (or most of the actors) were giving their best efforts.\n\nI didn't find any scene in this movie particular memorable. Also, I didn't really understand any character's motivations. Viola Davis, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were the obvious highlights. To me, Leto's Joker came off as a love-sick petulant child trying to prove how crazy he is. That's not a knock on his performance, but just a reminder that a good actor can only make so much of a mediocre script. Also, Cara Delevingne was truly awful.\n\nTo me, the worst aspect of the movie was that so much was built around the assumption that the squad bonded as a team and truly cared about each other (For example, Diablo's family comment), but nothing in the movie showed them developing this bond. Once again, it was just lazy.\n\nHonestly, I'm just afraid if we keep supporting these idiotic-poorly-made-comic book movies, our recent comic book renaissance will revert to the debacle that was the comic book movies of the early 2000's (Looking at you Catwoman).\n\nFans deserve better than this...", "Just saw it.

So good. And his lines were like, so funny, like, the one in the beginning, I don't really remember what it was, but it was totally awesome, and the one near the end, where I was like \"Wow, this is so funny, I totally see why he is in the movie!\", and then, when they are in the bar, and Rick Flag says they are free to go, and he IMMEDIATELY stands up und leaves, and I thought \"Yeah, that makes totally sense for him to do, because he was just trying to survive and get away for the whole time\", but then in the next shot he is again there with the team on their suicide mission, which was so surprising, I totally did not see that coming, and I was immediately wondering what secret motivations he could have that had been hidden from us in all the scenes we have seen before - he has to have them, otherwise this would just make no sense at all and would just be dumb. So good. ", "My thoughts on the movie: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/Nyj9cWz.gifv\n\nMy thoughts on the soundtrack:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gVUYqto.gifv", "I really wanted to like this movie *WAYYYY* more than I actually did.  By the time the second trailer came out, I was convinced that this would blow Batman vs Superman out of the water.  Everyone seemed to have the potential to really bring these characters to life and it looked like Warner Brothers finally made a DC movie showing they understood the source material and could stand up to any of the Marvel movies.\n\nWhile not a train wreck, I think most of us can agree that there are plenty of things in this film that could have been VASTLY improved on.\n\nFirst off, it really only felt like the movie was about four people: Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Rick Flag, El Diablo.  Everyone else?  Stuck with throw away lines, spouting exposition and being nearby to pose with the Squad or toss around bad guys.  I definitely didn't get a sense of camaraderie from them working together nor feel they were like a family that El Diablo claimed he didn't want to lose.  \n\nHowever, Viola Davis as Waller kicked ass and it felt like she actually understood her character in and out.  And while I appreciate seeing a new spin on the Joker rather than trying to simply follow in the footsteps of Ledger, Nicholson, or even Hamill, I don't like gangsta Joker.  It felt weird to see him covered in bling and the tattoos still leave a bad taste in my mouth.  Leto did good considering what he had to work with and the performances he will be compared to, but I think an issue with why it wasn't that great is the same problem as to why the film wasn't that great.  The pacing.  \n\nWhen Joker first showed up on screen, i thought \"Oh cool!  There's our new Joker!\"  And then I thought, \"Why is this so underwhelming?\"  And it hit me.  There was no build-up.  It was just another thing thrown in to appease the comic book crowd.\n\nRemember the tension of the opening bank robbery in the Dark Knight?  Most people knew the Joker would show up, but Nolan let the suspense build and build until finally we can't take it anymore and then *BOOM!* Holy shit.  Joker.  This dude is up to no good.  A character like the Joker needs an intro like that to remind people he is dangerous through and through.  Even Burton knew this with his Batman film, keeping Nicholson covered in darkness until he finally reveals himself and begins to shoot a mob boss to death to creepy carnival music.  Instead, we get Leto in a straight jacket out of nowhere.  No buildup.  Just there to be there.  \n\nNothing in this film felt like it was building up to any real payoff.  Not the reveal of the Joker, not the initial attack in the subway by the Enchantress's brother, not when Slipknot dies (someone smartly pointed this out earlier on in the thread), not when El Diablo was finally coerced into using his powers, not the scene when Flag comes forward with what the squad is really up against, nor the final battle against Enchantress to save the world.  Everything just kinda kept happening, not slowing down to give the audience a chance to see for themselves certain things.  Like the real threat of Enchantress's master weapon or the motivation or desires of ALL the Suicide Squad members.\n\nThere is so much more I could whine about like the overuse of music (Don't even get me started about the music they used when Harley threw herself into the vat of acid and Joker chased after her), or how unoriginal most of the set pieces were, or how cliche and stereotypical a lot of the dialogue was. But, I still had fun at some parts.  It wasn't terrible, which is good (I guess) but it was about as plain as a comic book movie can get.  \n\nFrom here on out though, I can't trust Warner Brothers/DC trailers to mean anything anymore.  Batman vs Superman had great ones and...that speaks of itself.  Suicide Squad had great trailers and this definitely has a long way to go before I would call this movie \"good\".  If Wonder Woman turns out to be a disappointment too, I'll just assume that these movies are simply cash-n-grab franchises, not films for fans.", "...and that's why you don't let the trailer makers edit your film", "The worst thing about this movie is definitely Enchantress. As soon as the idea was pitched, anyone with half a brain would know an audience aren't going to be interested in that villain/plot. Really surprised that wasn't shot down. And if you can manage to get past the fact they included the shitest villain ever - Why was Cara Delevingne given a really central role in a huge block buster? She isn't an actress. She's a model who's acted in maybe one other film? That's a serious risk! And it fell flat on it's face.", "Didn't expect to see the Flash! Happy unexpected surprise.\n\nEdit: Everyone hating on the soundtrack for using good (and not to mention popular) songs is ridiculous. Quit nit picking and just admit that this is the best movie DC has made since the Nolan Batman trilogy.", "I thought the theatrical cut of BvS was OK at best but actually enjoyed that more than Suicide Squad, albeit not by much. Whoever is cutting trailers for Warner needs a goddamn raise.\n\nTHE PROS:\n\n+ Performances. Smith, Robbie, Davis, Hernandez and Kinnaman in particular were really good.\n\n+ Visuals.

Not too surprising as Ayer has a lot of experience with that sorta thing.\n\n+ Random Flash cameo. Really didn't expect that.\n\n+ Jai Courtney finally gives a performance that didn't make me feel like I had cancer.\n\nTHE CONS:\n\n- The plot was total dogshit. It's not surprising they left it out of the trailers because it's immensely forgettable. The problem is this makes it hard to get invested in the suicide mission.\n\n- The opening is really messy. It's basically Viola sitting at a table reeling off expository back stories and is basically the laziest way to introduce characters imaginable. The super-choppy editing is also quite unpleasant.\n\n- Pandering overuse of pop music is total overkill and really took me out of a few scenes. Quite a few of them would've been more effective with no music at all.\n\n- Cara Delevingne was fucking ATROCIOUS in this. Honestly I believe she deserves a Razzie, mainly for her part in the third act of the film where she's jolting around spasmodically and talking with a hammy accent (I know it's closer to her native accent). I laughed every time she was on screen and not in a good way. It probably didn't help that all the CGI looked so shitty too.\n\n- Pretty much anytime the film tried to be super-serious and emotional it fell flat, namely Deadshot and his daughter and Flagg and Enchantress. I really didn't give a shit about the latter yet it sucked up so much screen time.\n\n- The villains were SHIT. Enchantress' brother looked like something out of Gods of Egypt.\n\n- Generic CGI overkill finale. Just didn't give a fuck about it.\n\n- Leto's Joker didn't really touch the sides. He seemed game but the script just wasn't strong enough and he didn't get any big iconic moments.\n\n- Action sequences are mostly anonymous and I don't really remember much about them.\n\n- That random shot of Flagg destroying a chicken drumstick. Seriously, why the fuck was that even in the film?\n\n- Slipknot has about a minute of screen time.\n\n- The \"Noooooooo!\" in El Diablo's flashback was hilariously corny. Jesus.\n\n- Poor character balancing. Some of the squad disappear for ages and are largely underdeveloped.", "This didn't deserve the ratings it got. Had low expectations and came out surprised.\n\nEdit: Could someone explain the ending scene to me? I didn't get the credit part with the one director and Batman.", "I left Batman v Superman thinking that I had no faith in DC movies directed by Snyder being good, but was hopeful that a different, more talented director could do something good in the DC Cinematic Universe.\n\nI left Suicide Squad with no faith in the DC Cinematic Universe, regardless of who directs the movie. And as someone who has loved DC comics since I was eight, that is painful for me to say.", "All the Fantastic Four comparisons are just silly. This was by no means a great movie but I didn't regret watching it. Disappointed it didn't live up to the hype but it was fun nonetheless. Side note: what are the constraints on Katana's sword?

I wasn't bored at any point throughout, the characters were entertaining, and the soundtrack was great.  I thought it was a great action flick with good comedic relief.

It's hard to not compare it against BvS, but I think this was definitely better.\n\nWill Smith played Floyd \"Will 'Deadshot' Smith\" Lawton, but I thought it actually really worked. His emotional arc was one of the few (maybe even the only I cared about) and he was pretty funny.\n\nMargot Robbie was pretty awesome as Harley, but I feel all of her moments were spoiled in the trailers. I think her best moment is on the car after the helicopter crash in the rain. She showed real vulnerability.\n\nI liked Leto, but felt like we either needed more of him or less of him. I liked that his character was kind of a throwback to classic mobsters who 'run the town'. I can see how his portrayal isn't for everyone though.\n\nWaller was a fucking badass.\n\nThis is really a case of poor script, good performances. Poorly paced, weird creative decisions and too many flashbacks. Also, how many fucking times can we see the villain using a 'weapon' that shoots a bright light into the sky? I'm so fucking over that. \n\nOverall I give it a 6/10, but that's probably generous.", "I had a lot of fun. Sure, it had it's faults but I'd definitely put it above BvS and I would love to see a sequel. I hope it at least makes enough money to warrant one.

It's a meh/10 for me. Here are some quick bullet points of what I liked and didn't like: \n\nLIKE: \nHarley Quinn nails the role \n\nViola Davis is a fucking badass \n\nDISLIKE: \nThe Plot is ridiculous, I would have loved for it to be more a small mission without fireworks and saving the world. \n\nI didn't buy Will smith as a villain. But that is just Will smith always playing good guys. He just doesn't fit the bad guy role. \n \nLeto seems to be playing a Guy who is trying to impersonate the Joker and not the Joker himself. But after Jack Nicholson and Ledgers  jokers... the bar was set high. \n\nFinal battle of the two giant dudes wrestling... well, should I say more? \n\n------\n\nI was very exited for the movie because I thought it was not going to be another super hero movie.... but it is. \nIts a good popcorn movie and there are a few laughs but it's disappointing for us who thought it was going to be something else... ", "Just saw the movie, and I was pleasantly surprised! I was expecting a complete waste of a movie, a la *Fant4stic*, but it was pretty okay! Jared Leto was a bit meh as the Joker, but it's balanced out by the fact that he's only in roughy 10-15 minutes. It seemed that he showed up every half-hour, so at least you could keep track of the running time.\n\nWill Smith Will Smiths it up, but at least he's somewhat sincere. Deadshot is basically a more world-weary, cynical version of his character in *ID4*. Margot Robbie is pretty good as Harley Quinn, though her emotional storyline is a little confused (since it's unclear if she wants to stop being a supervillain or not). Jai Courtney is a blast as Boomerang, but is sadly underused. Same for El Diablo, who is the heart and soul of the movie despite doing some heinous stuff. \n\nBut the real MVP of the movie is Amanda Waller, since Viola Davis knocks it out of the park! Everyone else acts in the movie, but she gives a performance. It was electrifying to see \"The Wall\" leap from page to screen. \n\nThe story was kinda meh, especially the big blue space laser shooting into the sky, but I didn't mind it because the characters were the main draw. Enchantress is a nothing villain as well, but at least she looks cool. And it was kinda obvious that there were reshoots, but there was only one glaring hint of it. Captain Boomerang ditches the group, only to show up a moment later to join in the final battle, which was pretty lame. I'd rather have him serve as a B-plot, trying to escape the team but eventually being forced into the final fight. \n\nAs a movie I'll see once, it was much better than expected. I'm sure if I watched it twice I'd see a lot more flaws, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. Here's hoping *Justice League* and *Wonder Woman* will be improvements on this.", "Just saw it. Boy, where to start?\n\nMajor spoilers ahead:\n\nThe editing in this movie is a mess. Like a real, serious mess. I knew they had to do reshoots to try to spice up the comedy and the dialogue, but man did they force the jokes early and they really felt flat. There was very little set up for the \"funny\" dialogue or quips. Also most of the jokes seemed based on Harley Quinn saying something zany or crazy and the joke always seemed to be about them being \"bad guys\" or her being insane. It sank into predictability pretty quickly and suffered from bad comedic timing as a result of rushed editing.\n\nThe characterization was also really poorly done. The movie violates the rule of \"show, don't tell\" a lot early on. There's a ton of exposition over Deadshot's and Harley's backstory, but the others, except, oddly, Enchantress, who has a larger role in the movie than I'd expected, get glossed over fairly quickly. Deadshot is basically hitman Will Smith (there's a ton of those trademark quips and jokes from Smith that reminds me of too many other characters he's played) and Killer Crock talks like a New York gangbanger for some reason (he calls Harley Quinn \"shorty\" at one very painful point). \n\nA large part of this movie is spent trying to shove scenes that make these characters more sympathetic down our throats, but the movie also has to constantly remind us the characters are \"bad guys.\" The movie probably uses the phrase \"bad guys\" more than any film in recent memory, as if it's constantly trying to remind the audience of who these people are. Anyway, the character development feels clunky and forced and the story really features a gross overabundance of flashbacks in trying to flesh out its characters, which screws with the pacing.\n\nThe Joker does basically nothing in this film and Jared Leto is certainly crazy, manic, and deranged, but he's also not very interesting as far as his character goes. He doesn't seem to have much purpose in the story except as a centerpiece for the glut of Harley Quinn flashbacks the film forces on the audience. \n\nUltimately, the story is just an uninteresting mess. An ensemble cast like this would really benefit from a more linear story and far fewer flashbacks. The threat at the heart of the movie is as convoluted and poorly developed as the characters and the film just shoves sentimentality down our throats in a desperate attempt to try and make these villains more heroic than they really need to be. ", "All I keep hearing from people who saw this is \"It actually wasn't that bad at all\". DC and WB are doomed with this kind of reaction.  Not very encouraging. I want to hear \"It was amazing, go see it!!\"  I guess they'll just reboot the entire thing in about a decade or so anyway.", "Anyone else thrown off by the soundtrack and placement of songs? I fee like this movie was trying wayyyyy too hard to have a memorable soundtrack like guardians of the Galaxy. Guardians of the galaxy's soundtrack tied into the movie and was there for a reason. I enjoyed that this movie had no product placement but I feel like the soundtrack alone was a type of product placement trying to get people to buy their soundtrack. \n\nOther complaints: 3 helicopters crash and no significant characters die.\n\nNo one really cares that Diablo literally saved everyone and sacrificed himself\n\nJoker is not so much a psychopath but more of a weird fetish type of dude. Anyone can be into weird things but I feel like every flash back scene with him in it was sexual. \n\nThe movie felt like it was trying too hard. The squad was trying to be a group of witty misfits rather than bad ass villains.\n\nAnyone else have trouble taking Diablo seriously with his Mexican cholo accent? \n\nKiller croc turned out to be a stereotypical hood ass black dude. \n\nThat scene in the end when they pull the witches heart out. \"Her heart is out she's weak get her!\" So corny... Way to state the obvious like we didn't know that her heart was her main power source.\n\nI absolutely hate repetitive enemies. Age of ultron and transformers did the same thing by making one CG character model and producing them on a massive scale to be the baddies that they fight off in a \"bad ass way\" \n\n\nI can go on but fuck this movie did not appeal to me.", "Will Smith played the father from the Pursuit of Happiness but in this universe he couldn't sell the medical device and turned to killing people.  Why did El Diablo kill all those people during that riot when no one was within 15 feet from him?  Why did he turn into a flaming Side Show Bob at the end?  Why was The Enchantress Shakira dancing in the last 30 minutes of the movie?  Why did she sound like an elderly English lady but she was a South American spirit entity?  Bullets against magic... that's just dumb and makes ZERO SENSE.  Why did Rick Flag have Deadshot's daughter's letters with him?  BET?  I mean... seriously... what the hell is going on? It wasn't unwatchable but damn it really missed the mark.  I felt like it was directed by 5 different directors.  I agree with what the other redditor said... it needed to be Rated-R, brutal and merciless.  Not quite \"The Raid\" but enough to remind you that these are fucking evil crazy bastards.

As it is, you can swap out any of the Suicide Squad with generic hero number five and get the same result: hero with superpower fights hordes of faceless alien robot things and saves the day. \n\nHeroes are limited by their own personal morality, and bad guys aren't. That means bad guys can do things that heroes can't. We needed to see that movie.\n\nImagine if instead of faceless alien henchmen, we had the Suicide Squad fighting real people. Terrorists, a private army, a collection of nasty people who do nasty things, whatever. And instead of going through the motions of killing or subduing them like any other hero would, lets take advantage of the fact that our guys are sadistic bastards.\n\nWhat if Killer Croc bites a guys head off. Blood sprays everywhere, gets in drunk Captain Boomerang's eyes and he starts flailing around blindly, killing some goons and accidentally chopping off Rick Flag's hand. Rick Flag tries to blow him up with his phone death app, but pushes the wrong button and Slipknot explodes instead.

This movie is better than [Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice](http://manapop.com/film/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-2016-review/) but not by a lot.\n\n**Random Thoughts:**\n\n* Waller makes Deadshot give her a marksmanship demonstration to see how good he really is even though he is known to be the best shot on the planet. Dumb and unnecessary.\n\n* Joker keeps popping in and out of this movie but has no bearing on the plot whatsoever.\n\n* We are introduced to squad member Slipknot without any backstory or explanation of his abilities. He is there simply to demonstrate the effectiveness of the nano-bombs placed in their necks.\n\n* Amanda Waller murders her people in cold blood because they weren\u2019t \u201ccleared\u201d for what they witnessed. Why the fuck was her staff not cleared? This is some Bond villain level bullshit.\n\n* Captain Boomerang carries around a pink plush horse toy. No explanation given.

He considers this group of murderers he\u2019s known for a whole of twenty minutes family?\n", "I'll start off by saying I enjoyed the movie. It's not great but I don't think it is 27% bad. I could have used more Joker and less Enchantress. I thought Will Smith was decent and he got the meatier back story but he didn't do much to make the character his own. Which I think really could have helped this movie. I tend to turn my brain off when it comes to comic movies and just enjoy the spectacle. But even doing that I did notice the glaring editing issues and tonal issues. Even noticing those though I can see the potential for a much better sequel if that gets green lit. I would give it a 6 out of 10. It really could have used more breathing room with the introductions and less time spend on a villain that was way too powerful for the team. If there was a lower stakes villain I think it would have helped rather than hurt the movie. But all and all it is a good popcorn flick and I look forward to seeing where the characters go in the future.  ", "Even if you didn't know about the reshoots already, you'd be able to tell how chopped up this movie has been. Character arcs head nowhere, plot points can be dropped on a dime. The entire film, but especially the opening, looks like it was edited by someone suffering a seizure. The opening tries to pass it off as a stylistic choice, but (and I swear I don't mean this as elitist, you'll feel the exact same for yourself) you can sense the desperation behind it to clean up this mess they've made of B-roll on the floor. Flashback scenes are clearly meant to have more happen in them, but they've got to hurry to the next scene with this villain that I don't give a shit about so those flashbacks get culled.\n\nThe three performances that people seem unanimous on are Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis. They're right. I liked Jared Leto's Joker, even though his character's involvement seems butchered the worst in all this. If he would've organically only had eight or so minutes in the film, that wouldn't be a fault. After all, Hannibal Lecter and Pinhead are both especially iconic villains and they only appear in a few minutes of their respective films. But you watch Suicide Squad and each scene with him seems like it was meant to have more attached to it originally. Critics mention that he doesn't have a memorable scene that matches Heath Ledger. Hell, I would be willing to believe that scene was snipped out because it didn't fit into this \"we edit our movies on meth\" dynamic that DC seems stuck to. \n\nAlso, I loved Diablo. He was shafted into a smaller role but there is still enough here to make him a character I want to see more of. There is one scene (that is shown somewhat in the trailer) with Joker and Quinn that I think is exceptional. I love the dialogue, I love the music choice for it (thank God they didn't ruin this one by choosing some ironic top 40 tune), I love that DC almost lets the moment breathe before strangling it and moving on to the next shoot-out that seriously looks like it belongs on a straight-to-DVD Woody Harrelson crime thriller. \n\nI like Jai Courtney. Never thought I would say that. He doesn't seem to have much to do here and again, that is likely the fault of the studio filleting this finished product. \n\nDavid Ayers seems so uninspired here. There were more than a handful of scenes that I thought, \"If only the direction had a little interest in being less 'shoot-by-numbers', it would make this bit so much better.\" I haven't seen End of Watch. I haven't seen Fury. But I remember Training Day as a movie where talented actors manage to make a damn decent film out of an average script that would've been forgettable without them.\n\nDo I want another Suicide Squad? Yes. I want this cast, including Leto as Joker. Bring in Edgar Wright, like you're snatching up Marvel's ex-girlfriend. Start some beef. Then give him full creative control. Just do better than this.

I'd watch a movie that was just Harley Quinn\n\n* I actually really liked Will Smith too.

Sorceress activated the charge and peaced out of there, but everyone was just fine and dandy.

So instead of properly teaching me about these characters and how they came about and letting the movie breathe, I was treated with FLASHCARDS on descriptions of these characters. Literally WHAT does that have to do in context with the film?? NOTHING. It is just in context with the promotion of the movie, meaning it DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.\n\nJared Leto's Joker was nice. What was not nice was his relationship with Harley Quinn. BRUSHED OVER. Not explained. Simply told to us quickly. I don't see why Harley would fall in love with this man. I was TOLD that she did via VOICEOVER. Literally WHAT IS THIS MESS? This relationship was absolutely slaughtered. I am certain there was lots of improv cut from the movie, and even if it was bad, they should have kept it in. Why? Because scenes were not scenes. Scenes were reduced to short CLIPS, GLIMPSES of what possibly could have been beautiful storytelling.\n\nI am frustrated with the first 40 minutes of this movie. From then on, it improves with some action, but of course, we do not get to see much shining from characters here. What was the action? Shooting guns. That's it. I never thought I'd ever say this, but I am: I actually wanted EXPLOSIONS in this movie. The characters did not show enough personality, creativity or uniqueness during the action. Spice Harley up! Let her bounce off the walls with her gymnastic abilities! Let Katana go wild with her sword!\n\nWhy were the cast able to do lots of their stunts? Because there are barely any stunts. Harley Quinn running up the walls and across the roof of an elevator was the most impressive stunt in this movie. There is a lack of danger, quickly introducing the creepy minions, but soon brushing over them. Instead of the disturbing brainwashed aliens that they were when first introduced, they simply become punching bags. While it was fun and chaotic, it was lacking any sort of suspense. Who cared what was going to happen next? I knew they were just going to take down the minions and move to the next location.\n\nCharacters like Katana and the crocodile guy, what's the point? They were both awesome, but both heavily underused. Heck, the least they could have done was done even A LITTLE BIT with Slipknot before they blew his head off in an anti-climactic manner.\n\nEnchantress, no. She was pretty cool in her first form but - once again - bad story structure and pacing made her an underwhelming villain. In her second form, ridiculous. Maybe I would have appreciated her jellyfish wobbling more if A. they didn't plop some random bimbo's voice over Cara's, B. covered Cara's face more to hide her weak acting expressions and C. made her more evil. However, I did like the silhouette shots we got of her witch form being shadowy in the light. Her weird minotaur looking minion? No. Just no. He looked like he was ripped out of Percy Jackson.\n\nWho is the focus on? Deadshot? Harley? Joker? They should have picked Harley and Joker and ran with it. Of course, despite Will Smith's good performance and line delivery, he requires the most attention. In consequence, the crammed plot suffered.\n\nMy final complaint: editing. Oh boy... The editing team is in deep trouble. I'm not even going to go into specifics, but all I'm going to say is that I was frowning a lot after certain shots. \n\nI sound so pissed, right? Yeah, because I'm frustrated that this movie was rushed and not as good as it could have been. Even underneath all the mess, you have a fun decent action movie. Set the bar very low going in and do not take the movie seriously. You will probably enjoy your time.\n\nAlso, the 3D: kind of underutilized. The only parts in the movie that are honestly great in 3D are literally one or two shots of the minions being smashed apart and flying off the screen. Not to mention that it darkens the movie a lot and it became particularly hard to see what was happening during some of the action. Watch in standard 2D. \n\nRant over.\n\n5.5/10.\n\nTL;DR: Poor editing, messy script, Harley and Joker origin story should have been developed more, other origins should have been kept for another movie or characters should have been completely gone, fun but basic action, mediocre rental movie.", "I really hope I'm not the only person who died of laughter watching Killer Croc crawl into the sewer with the Navy Seals.

I kept staring at all of Tommy Lee Jones's wrinkles and was confused with Alicia Vikander's character's motives and what not. \n\nOverall, this was a solid entry. If you're looking for an action film, then you'll be satisfied. 6/10", "I just saw it and here are my thoughts.\n\nC+ if I had to give it a grade.\n\nThe movie was a dumbed down version of the trilogy. I knew as soon as Nikki was on that bike and the Asset was setting up a sniping position that she was dead. Why? Because they did the exact same thing in the second movie. I should have been surprised by her survival. I had hoped some environmental factor would have obstructed his shot given the rioting, but I guess they wanted Julia Stiles gone. Her death was handled disrespectfully in terms of her contributions to the series. She might as well have been one of the Alpha or Bravo teams that gets dispatched with contemptuous ease.\n\nBourne was aimless as a character. What does he want? What does his life look like without the CIA? Aimless drifter, bare knuckle fighting for a living? If he doesn't want to be a killer then what hobby interest or passion does he have? Or is he still struggling with his government programming? If Bourne isn't going to say hardly anything he should be expressing to us through his actions. Him trying art classes or yoga or wood working or something to give us an idea that he is a person, not a plot device. \n\nIf the movie wanted to explore Bourne returning to the CIA they should have given him a compelling reason. Like how about a terrorist attack purposefully or accidentally takes out CIA assets in an area where Bourne happens to be. CIA Has been keeping distant surveillance on him because they can never truly leave a rogue asset alone. So after the attack Bourne is now the only one close enough to take out this clear and present danger. A legit national threat appeals to his patriotism. And then the twist the whole thing was contrived to get him back into the open to either kill him or bring him back into the fold. Anything other than this silly Facebook plot. \n\nHow about we start exploring Bournes future rather than his past. His past was explored enough in the trilogy. \n\nWay too much shakey cam. \nSince when do American police lose track of suspects during a vehicle pursuit with a helicopter present? \nAll the classified file stuff they had us read could have been dialogue between Nikki and Bourne. \n\nCIA knows Bourne is a master of spycraft yet they try the same tactics over and over again to try and apprehend or kill him. Why?\n\nI feel like this is a classic example of a movie that wanted to play it safe by rehashing the same formula. ", "boring. uninspired. felt too much like a board of suits said \"make it as Bourne(tm) as possible and fuck good plot devices\"", "The movie was a big meh for me, but one thing I need to get off my chest is Vikander's awful accent. I love Alicia and she did a fine job in the film overall, especially in her silent moments and reactions. But her American accent is one of the most noticeable fake accents I've seen in a long time. It really sounded like her natural voice was trying to fight through every moment. It was all over the place and would've been much less distracting just to have her ditch the American accent and make her character someone who came over from another country. She didn't need to be American for her role to work.", "Matt Damon got lucky and grabbed the only dodge charger in the area that had disabled airbags. ", "As has been said here already. Not bad, not great. *Good*", "[deleted]", "Oceans 13.5. Toulour is tired of Linus punking him all the time.", "First of all: I'm the biggest fan of the Bourne trilogy. When they announced this movie I was absolutely ecstatic. I watched every trailer and every clip before its release. I had absolutely high hopes for this movie in every way.  I sat down and watched it yesterday (I RARELY bother to go to a movie on its opening day). My opinion is that Jason Bourne had almost all of the things that made the first 3 movies excellent. The one thing that was missed however... Was a tightly knit, coherent, and compelling story.\n\nSo many things bothered me about this movie when you compare it to Supremacy and Ultimatum. I had kind of hoped it was going to open with a scene of Bourne escaping New York in 2004, like the way Ultimatum started right off with him escaping Moscow. Picked up right where we left off. Instead they had to fill it with flashbacks to explain the setup to the newcomers.... And suddenly we're in Greece.  \n\nThe next thing, quite painful, is how Bourne's reappearance \"back on the grid\" is so anticlimactic. The first CIA scene basically has Heather in the conference room with Dewey saying \"Nicky hacked us, we already have a fix on her travel patterns, and she's probably on her way to go meet up with Bourne right now. So let's go get them both\".  That really deflated this fucking movie.  In 2 & 3, Bourne's popping up back on the grid came as a shock and surprise in superlative timing. In this installment, it just kind of came as a yawn. \n\nNext, we are offered zero explanation of how Nicky is able to find Bourne so easily in Athens. To my knowledge they haven't seen each other since Tangier.  Their dialogue indicates they might've had some sort of contact since, but again.... Their reunion is totally anticlimactic.  He's like \"what's wrong?\".  I was expecting him to say \"why are you here?\" Or \"how did you find me?\" or something like that.  Those two had real chemistry towards the end of Ultimatum, and their dialogue and chemistry here just fell flat.  With Nicky dying really conjured the scene of Marie dying in Goa, but didn't nearly contain the raw emotion of that event... even though it clearly was intended to.\n\nThe subplot of the tech/social media mogul being bought and manipulated by the CIA was relevant to current events (FBI trying to persuade Apple), but was entirely unnecessary to this movie and should've been left out entirely. It has nothing to do with Bourne's character.\n\nWe get brought back to London and Berlin.  C'mon... We've already been to both. \n\nAlicia Vikander's character doesn't nearly stack up to Joan Allen's performance in the similar role.\n\nThe real sticking point in this film is the connection between Bourne's father and Treadstone. That should've been 90% of the movie's plot focus.\n\nAfter the big final showdown, we don't get nearly a fraction of the sense of empathy that we got at the end of Supremacy.... When he risks it all just to go to Moscow, to apologize to the girl who's parents he killed, Marie's death avenged, and walks away in the snow by himself looking broken.  \n\nThe ending sequence of Jason Bourne bothers me the most. All 3 of the trilogy had an awesome ending, especially #2. (\"Get some rest Pam, you look tired...\") I'm wondering what the fuck is Bourne doing out in the middle of DC in broad daylight talking to Heather in a park when everyone is still after him. \n\nOn a positive note... The ending definitely told me they intend to make another one. They definitely can't leave the whole franchise on that ending, no way.\n\nI was kind of expecting something to happen in this movie like the CIA gets backed into a corner and some serious threat is in play, and they reluctantly have to ask Bourne to help them stop it. Bourne saves world, gets exonerated, a full presidential pardon, gets debriefed, and is allowed to return to a normal life. The movie could end with him going home to his family or something. I don't know, maybe that's what happens in the next one...\n\nAnd I hope there's a next one.  I really do.", "just watched this movie. my advice, don't watch it. just pretend it's a spin-off series and you'll be fine. Otherwise the Bourne series will be forever ruined in your mind. My contentions with the movie:\n\n1. A lot of wasted lines, technobabble notwithstanding. (If u ever watch the original series, most of the lines were on point.)\n2. Questionable motives for all parties involved. Nikki Parson's hacking for some nobody. Like wtf? In her exile and living off the grid she's turned into some ideologue? This is my main contention because I think it was so out of character for her. The whole movie started on this shaky premise where she stupidly decided to hack the Agency whereas as a former agent, she should've known better. \n3. Very artificial and tenuous subplot where Bourne found out his father's involvement in the agency. If u wanna go that far, might as well involve his nanny and his kindergarten teacher too. And why didn't Pamela Landy told him this? And where is she now btw? She should at least make some (token) appearance.\n4. A lack of intelligence and indescreet behaviours for the supposed intelligence agents. Like planning an assassination on a tech panel in Vegas!! (haha not so clandestine at all), or commandering a SWAT vehicle in an attempt to evade the authority, the director dismissing security details and waited in his suite alone, the director meeting a tech startup CEO in a public restaurant , Bourne entering the hacker's place ignoring the fact that the windows are all wide and the blinds up...\n5. The overdone car chase sequence that ought to belong in the Fast Furious series. \n6. The final fight scene which gives you tunnel vision and possibly vomitory(not a real word) response.\n7. There was also a scene where Bourne nicked all those nifty spy-gadgets. But minus Q. This scene irritates me because as we know, Bourne is a resourceful person. He always comes prepared and he plans 50 steps ahead. In this movie, he's all reactionary - which makes this movie the least Bournesque movie of them all.\n8. [Enhance!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uoM5kfZIQ0)\n9. The overly used social media vs privacy and snowdengate trope - which does not tie to Bourne at all as he has no stake whatsoever in this. \n10. The asset killed his father too. Wow, what a coincidence!\n11. Don't know how nikki found Bourne when he's supposedly off the grid and left him a scrap paper note. This is also the worst violation because in Bourne movies, you don't find him. He finds you.\n12. I didn't know u can hack a power station of a foreign country remotely nor did I know you can hack a laptop through your mobile phone. This is like skynet level tech. Can you hack my ipad through my hair dryer too? I thought the Bourne series prides itself on a relative sense of realism?\n13. I thought the movie would be better if it ended with the director's demise and the asset not being his father's killer- Bourne then would decline the offer of going back in and give a final warning to that overly ambitious girl about the consequences of hunting him. Bourne walks away nonchalantly and then the extreme would play. With the asset still at large, possibly going rogue with unknown motives, this would at least set up nicely for the coming sequels if there's any.  \n\nOverall, it's a shitty tribute movie, not unlike the Legacy. The best bit in this movie is Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, the Greek riots and the way he set off those sounds alarms in the surrounding buildings (which is the only faithful homage to the Bourne series).\n\n4/10", "[deleted]", "I enjoyed the movie.

Could have cut it short.

He should have been way more injured than he was when his car crashed at the end. \n* 4 I wish Matt had more lines. A week or so ago I read he only had about 25 lines. Sure enough, he had hardly any.

It's not like he talked excessively in other movies to begin with...", "Spoilers ahead.\n\nIt was better than I thought it would be, but I'm still soured on how it basically ruined the ending of Ultimatum. I wanted the Bourne character to have a semi-happy conclusion, and Ultimatum was as good as it was going to get. Plus it bookended the trilogy perfectly. 'Jason Bourne' just felt tacked on, especially bringing his father into everything. Bourne's story was done. He got away and he won. He didn't have to deal with the CIA anymore. He was free. Then Nicky brought Bourne back in, which was odd, considering how much she knew he wanted to be left alone. She must have known doing so would end in tragedy for either her or him. \n\nIt did have the best action out of all of them though. And the new characters were decent, especially Vincent Cassel, who isn't just a generic bad guy, he actually has a motive. I wasn't particularly fond of the 'Deep Dream' storyline though. The Bourne series has always felt more intimate in scale compared to the typical Hollywood action fest that most of these movies are. Bringing in another organization to deal with was a bit too grandiose I thought. \n\nThere wasn't much new brought to the table, and anything that was didn't work enough to convince me that a sequel was necessary. It almost felt like I was watching a condensed version of the trilogy - Bourne's lady friend dies, old CIA guy doesn't trust the CIA woman's handling of Bourne, CIA woman helps Bourne, car chase ensues, bad guy dies. It was very much a retread of what made the trilogy successful. But you can only get so much mileage out of a good story. There's really no need to rehash what we've already seen.

It's hard to imagine Dassault, the hacker, would so carelessly stick a thumb drive into a computer with internet access.  Did he forget about stuxnet?  This stuck out to me and broke the immersion.  \nOne thing I liked about the bourne trilogy is that hollywood-tier hacking was only limited to the government agencies.  I never read the books so I'm not sure if that's true, but in my mind keeping to that rule maintains a suspension of belief in the trilogy.\n2. The scene where Lee, the CIA cyber-ops woman, shoots Tommy Lee Jones.  Bourne says something like \"you were never here\" to Lee.  \nOh come on.  \nKeep in mind, the movie had scenes where the authorities were watching hotel security cam feeds, so is the viewer supposed to believe that Ms. CIA is a visually stunning yet cold-blooded killer that got away with murder?

And this is coming from a hard-core Jason Bourne fan.  The whole movie seemed pointless. It felt like one single continuous and tedious scene rather than a series of scenes put together to tell a compelling story. And the movie is completely dumbed down.  Gone are the days of feeling like you are seeing the tricks of the trade of a CIA-trained assassin. There are no clever evasive tactics, no cool spy gadgets in use, nothing to make the audience feel like they are seeing some kind of forbidden knowledge of how things work behind the curtain.  Everything is dumbed down to the point where \"hacking\" takes the form of blinking lights on the screen stating \"the virus has been planted.\"  Gone are the days of well-choreographed fight scenes and in replacement is some kind of wrestling where adversaries clumsily try to use some sort of Jiu-Jitsu choke-hold to incapacitate the other. There is no clever dialogue but rather a repeating pattern of one character suggesting a course of action and the other character reminding the first that they are dealing with Jason Bourne.  But the ultimate failing of the movie is that there is no point. The character is just aimlessly roaming the world without purpose and the story line does not give Jason any purpose for doing what he does in the film. Aside from the story, the production value seemed lacking. I seriously thought I was watching something that could have been made in the 1980's or 1990's.  The colors were not vibrant, the soundtrack was boring, and the effects were ho-hum.  We've seen 10 minute car chases countless times.And if you are going to see the film do not waste your money on the RPX if your theater has one.

The plot is bad; the attempt to combine cultural buzzwords (Wikileaks/social media privacy) was clunky and there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense when you think about it. It was frustrating how they just reused set pieces from earlier films without grounding it in any emotional significance. Like, Nicky's death should've been a way bigger deal. By the time it's all over the only thing that's happened is the series has been set up for another sequel.\n\nAlso: maybe it's just because everyone else around her looks super haggard, but Alicia Vikander is almost distractingly youthful in the movie.

It's a multi-million dollar spy movie, you could at least run this shit by one of your IT guys and see if he laughs before filming.    \n    \nIt checks the right boxes for action and \"Oh god it's Jason Bourne\" suspense, but there's no story there and no performances worth watching. The best part about Bourne was his humanity in the earlier movies, and this one goes out of its way to just be a generic action movie with a mostly silent badass whose motivation in the entire thing is questionable at best.    \n    \n If they stuck with the naming convention of the original three films they'd have called this one the Bourne Paycheck. There's no story worth telling here, nothing to be invested in or desire a resolution for, nothing to fill in the gaps since the last films and no closure to tie the series up. It's pointless.", "My response to this movie was so visceral that this comment may be my \"War and Peace\". Settle in.\n\nTl;dr: this was 2 hours of shaky cam, terrible acting, and putrid plot. It is basically an Edward Snowden wet dream. \n- A quick note on shaky cam: if you haven't seen [Tony Zhou's Every Frame a Painting about David Fincher](https://youtu.be/QPAloq5MCUA) illustrates just how lazy using a shaky cam for the entire movie really is.\n\nWe meet Jason Bourne as he is involved in doing some sort of bare-knuckle boxing. Why? It's never really made clear, but apparently it's some sort of globally organized series of events that pays nothing. In Supremacy at least, the context of Damon running on the beach was that he was living off the grid trying to stay low. Nicky Parsons tries to explain it a bit later in the film that he is still punishing himself for whatever reason, but cripes, bare-knuckle boxing was the best activity they could come up with? So the writers said, \"Ok, this guy is a tortured soul. What could he do to demonstrate that?\" \"How about if he literally tortures himself?\" \"Done!\" Matt Damon runs a real-life charity for God's sake. Couldn't Bourne punish himself by trying to solve problems for the poor? Like the A Team? Bare-knuckle boxing makes absolutely ZERO sense in the context of the film except to get Bourne to Iceland. \n\nMeanwhile, we get re-introduced to Nicky Parsons who we learn is, in a way doing what I would hope: she is still trying to fight the unjust programs of the CIA. However, whatever positive that is generated in learning that is immediately destroyed by the absolutely ridiculous tech-speak that is used during her opening scene. I'm not especially technical, but even I know that a hacker saying the line \"Use SQL to corrupt their databases\" is like saying \"Use a car to drive.\" I feel like it's important to note that this was said in a subtitle, which meant that someone wrote it down in the script, possibly translated it into whatever language was spoken, and then written into the subtitles. And no one during that whole process said, \"Uh, is this a totally idiotic statement?\" Once I saw that, I knew that this movie was in trouble, and this was like, 5 minutes in. Anyway, Parsons hacks into the CIA database using a \"predictive algorithm\" which I didn't even catch because of the goddamned SQL line. Again, no one even did a LITTLE bit of research of what hackers actually do. They just crapped some technical words onto the script and called it good. She grabs a bunch of files.\n\nBack at CIA headquarters, we are also introduced during this sequence to Heather Lee, played by Alicia Vikander. I must admit that I had never seen anything she had starred in, so perhaps her acting on the whole isn't as bad as it was in this film, but dang, it is bad. So anyway, the CIA figures out that someone is hacking into their classified files. Lee is somehow able to plant some malware in Parsons\u2019 computer, and the CIA is able to shut off the power to the building in which Parsons is working. This is the first of many technological skills the CIA will forget they have over the course of this film.\n\nAlright, so the CIA quickly identifies that Parsons is behind the hack. They use facial recognition to quickly identify which country Parsons has travelled to, and she has found Bourne at his fighting venue where he is badly overacting how he is torturing himself by getting punched a lot. Then, upon seeing Parsons in the crowd, he quickly dispatches his opponent. They leave and are quickly spotted during a riot by CIA operatives, and an admittedly fairly cool set piece allows them to escape after they split up.\n\nThe CIA uses closed circuit cameras to search for Parsons, and Heather Lee realizes that a blur could be her, so they back the video up 20 seconds, enhance a blob, and BINGO! Bourne meets up with her and escape on a motorcycle. But wait, the CIA has an \"Asset\" in the area and they know exactly where Bourne and Parsons are going to go and when they'll arrive, so the Asset goes up to the top of a building where he'll have a vantage point to snipe them.\n\nIt's at this point where I want to take a moment to note how horrible the writing is related to the Asset. He is a CIA operative as far as I understand. There's some backstory to him, but the point is that he is supposed to be working for the USA, and the USA is supposed to be mostly good. Anyway, he climbs to the top of a building and casually shoots 3 civilian rioters so that he can shoot Bourne and Parsons. What the fuck is this? The Bourne movies have had their share of violence to non-combatants, but the victims were all in the game in some way. Sure, Simon Ross from the Ultimatum was just a reporter, but he was playing with dangerous information, and killing him showed how far the CIA would go to keep the information secret, so he played a valuable plot point. In this world, the rioters are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So it's just violence to violence's sake as far as I can tell, and it only escalates from here. At least in the Ultimatum, there was a somber tone at the CIA when Ross was shot by an Asset. This time, no one in the control center seems to give two shits when someone gets killed.\n\nAlright, so the CIA track Bourne and Parsons on a motorcycle down to the foot, predict their path, and the Asset predictably shoots Parsons off the motorcycle just as they're about to escape. Parsons with her last breath tosses a locker key to Bourne.\n\nFast forward past more overacting among the CIA Director (Tommy Lee Jones), the National Intelligence Director (Scott Shepherd), and Heather Lee, and we end up in London with Bourne again who is trying to track down the hacker that Parsons was working with to decrypt the files that she downloaded. Remember that malware? As soon as Bourne connects the USB drive to the hacker's computer, it activates and the CIA knows where he is. Uh, remember that facial recognition software that the CIA used to identify Parsons? Yeah, doesn't work in London. Remember that technology that they used to shut off the power to the building? Doesn't work in London. You know what does work? Hacking a fucking phone that is sitting on the desk next to the computer. Again, I'm not super technical, but this struck me as being the most ridiculous thing I can remember seeing in a movie. They just invent some garbage to move the plot along. Alright, so the CIA deletes the files, but Bourne escapes after finding the name of a guy that worked on the project.\n\nSo Bourne has the guy arrange to meet him (\"You come alone!\"). At this point, we encounter the SECOND horrifying violence in this scene. Heather Lee wants to use the meeting to bring Bourne in, and Dewey wants Bourne dead, so Dewey sets up an arrangement with the guy and the Asset to kill Bourne. Lee's plan is to tail the guy with CIA operatives, but for Dewey's plan to work, there can't be any witnesses. So the Asset follows the guy and starts killing CIA operatives willy nilly. THE CIA DIRECTOR IS KILLING HIS OWN MEN. Bourne figures everything out, of course, and gets to the guy by creating a diversion, learns some more information, and the Asset comes along and kills the guy and Bourne escapes, meets up with Heather Lee, and they hatch a plan to take down the system.\n\nOh by the way, there is some absolutely ludicrous story about a fake Facebook and the CIA working with the fake Mark Zuckerberg played by Riz Ahmed. Again, terrible acting. I had absolutely no interest in this story line at all because the acting made me want every character involved to die.\n\nNow the characters are converging in Vegas where there is a security conference. The fake Mark Zuckerberg will be with Dewey at a forum discussing privacy, but wait, fake Mark Zuckerberg is going to out the CIA for helping create fake Facebook! So Dewey now has to kill THIS GUY now. Dewey sets the Asset on fake Mark Zuckerberg. Meanwhile, Bourne is browsing around the security conference and the CIA can't find him because there are no cameras ANYWHERE in Vegas, you know? And Bourne is wearing a hat. Anyway, he MacGyver's a bunch of security toys for use later. He gets wind of the plot to kill fake Zuckerberg (I can't recall how exactly), and swoops in to save the day by blinding the sniper with a spotlight and shooting a bunch into the vent where the Asset here. Then Bourne pursues Dewey up to his hotel room where they exchange some idiotic dialog, and then Dewey is killed by Lee when Dewey is about to kill Bourne. Bourne takes the guns so Lee isn't implicated because he's a good guy, but it's important to point out that he would be responsible for killing a CIA agent AND THE FUCKING CIA DIRECTOR at this point. But let's not worry about that because he's Jason Bourne.\n\nNow comes our final pursuit in which the Asset kills TWO MORE law enforcement guys (one security guy at the hotel and a policeman guarding a SWAT team van). The latter guy gets his throat cut. That is grim for just about any movie, but for a Bourne movie to do it is such a departure that it is hard to describe. The chase scene through Vegas is ridiculous, and if you were already aware of the shaky cam, this chase scene could have made you nauseous. The final kill scene is basically a carbon copy of the scene from the Ultimatum but in the dark and hard to make out the characters half the time.\n\nSo now everything wraps up. Bourne demonstrates that he\u2019s again one step ahead of the CIA and the music starts up.\n\nI could not have been more disgusted by this movie. It was Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls level bad compared to the trilogy. There wasn't one interesting aspect to it. I think everyone must have been saying, \"Don't worry about any of the plot holes or whatever, people totally believe that the government is watching us, so we'll shoot a bunch of scenes about that, PLUS we're shooting a chase scene in VEGAS BABY VEGAS!\" and that was it.", "I watched the first three this week prior to a Thursday night opening show and, man, was I disappointed. Bourne rides a motorcycle on stairs like in Ultimatum, he goes to Berlin like in Supremacy, people at the CIA are looking for him. I thought the Facebook-like subplot didn't add much and Bourne's motivation for pursuing the asset at the end didn't make sense to me, since the Bourne movies are more about the evil of institutions and the corruption of low-level managers within them.\n\n**Best thing about it:** Greece chase had tension and surprising ending\n\n**Worst thing about it:** Bourne's ability to quickly assess his tools  was missing! (Because he's old?) He never looked at a map once even though the CIA had a nifty map adjusted in real time for police blockades.\n\nIt's not a bad movie but falls short of the high bar of the trilogy.", "Saw it last night and I left the theatre feeling...nothing really. I'm a huge fan of Matt's and I'd say I watched the film more for him than for the franchise. I have to agree with some people calling it a \"meh\" movie though. The story wasn't gripping enough that I had to shut everything out and just focus on it for however long it runs (hopefully I'm not the only one who does this lol) and I didn't feel enough of Jason Bourne for a Jason Bourne film. I didn't hate nor love it. It was something that took two hours of my time on a Friday night and that's that.", "Why did they use so much shaky cam? It just makes it seem lazy. Not only that, but it is hard to focus on what is going on. Even the texts and computer screens shook and zoomed. Why? We have action movies like The Raid now, with amazing fight scenes and little shaky cam, so that you can see the fights clearly. More movies should take cues from that.\n\nAlso, the close up of everyone's faces was extremely annoying. It is almost like they could have filmed the whole movie with the main actors in the same room only three or four times throughout the entire movie. The closeups would be cool for a few scenes, but not every scene. Especially not long dialogue.\n\nFinally, and this was a little less annoying, the CIA girl (I can't even remember her name at this point) had the worst American accent I've ever heard. You could hear her regular accent coming through in almost every sentence.\n\nThese three things kept me from enjoying what should have been a fun movie. My opinion: go rent \"The Raid: Redemption\" if you want an amazing action movie, and wait for Jason Bourne to come out on DVD and Blu-Ray. \n\nEdit: Switched a couple words around. It wasn't reading right.", "The hacker dude was such a stupid character. He looked like your typical hacker villain from a videogame. I swear I've seen his character model somewhere before. But seriously, how did he not have any sort of high tech security system in his place? I deliver packages to houses with motion censors and cameras everywhere and they're just regular people living in the suburbs. ", "I liked it but the plot was just the same as before. It made me think about the alternate ending they filmed but never used for the Bourne Identity. After the filming was largely completed but before it was released in theaters, the 9/11 attacks happened. The producers apparently realized this would herald a sea-change in US foreign policy, and potentially domestic attitudes as well. Suddenly, the idea of a highly trained government assassin might not seem like a bad thing. So the alternate ending is Jason Bourne waking up from a fainting spell in Greece, after surprising Marie at her sea-side shop. He looks over and sees Brian Cox sitting next to him. Brian explains, referring to the terror attacks, that 'it's a different world now'. He tells him the CIA is no longer interested in neutralizing him as a threat, and instead could use his services. But no pressure, and no strings.\n\nObviously they didn't go with this, and I think the original suits the story better. But after seeing Jason Bourne, I kept wondering what it could have been like. Instead of each movie being a repeat of the last--perfectly corrupt top officials lacking any instinct or insight other than \"it's Jason Bourne we gotta get him this time!\"--it could explore the grey areas. Not just \"Jason Bourne vs ISIS\" (although who wouldn't watch that), but Jason Bourne working out for himself where he fits in this new world.\n\nThat's probably my biggest issue with this final film. Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel are just too easy to hate, from an audience's perspective. Tommy Lee has his own guys killed off and stages the assassination of a Mark Zuckerberg type (in front of a global conference? really?) so that he can hack into everybody's computers to seemingly watch everyone all the time with no checks or oversight. Obviously we're supposed to hate him. And Vincent Cassel not only murders EVERYONE who poses the slightest inconvenience to him, he does so with no precision or finesse. I kept hearing Chris Cooper's line from Identity in my head: \"Jesus, what is the French word for 'stakeout'?\" when he sees the French police make a huge spectacle of their presence and effectively warn Jason. Like, Jesus Vincent Cassel, keep a fucking lid on it sometimes. He also killed Jason's father. What a terrible person, of course I want Jason to take him down. I never felt like that with the prior assets, exept for Carl Urban in Supremacy. Even there, he presented a \"this is business and it's the life we chose, deal with it Jason\" attitude. And Clive Owen in the first... miles away. He wasn't a bad guy any more than Jason was, and that made his death scene that much more powerful.\n\nAlso, the shaky cam seemed shakier than ever in this one. I loved the fight choreography of the first three, even with shaky cam they still had a great sense of flow to them. This was just choppy.\n\nWith all that said, I'm still glad I saw it and I did enjoy it. I just didn't love it like I did the first three. Overall, 3/5.", "Would you some what agree though, that Heather Lee (Alicia) may have had good intentions, but the reason she said that in the car was to cover up because she really wasn't supposed to tell anybody about what happened? She can't just say she thinks Jason Bourne is good. They all think Jason killed the director. She wouldn't just end up telling everyone she killed the director? \nWhat do you think?\n\n", "Just got out of the theatre for this one. It certainly wasn't a bad film, but while watching I couldn't shake the feeling that it was just completely unnecessary and more of the same. Bourne gets dragged back, again. A lady friend of his gets involved and gets shot while with Bourne in a vehicle, again. Bourne discovers his past, again. It feels like anyone could have wrote this movie by just looking at the previous films.\n\nThere were also some cliche parts, like the whole \"enhance\" and very basic depictions of hacking. Overall the film didn't feel as sharp as the original trilogy.\n\nI did like the last act more, it felt pretty \"Bourne\" and the car chase was intense, if over the top. But overall the film just felt like a retread. Even Legacy tried to do new stuff.", "Jason 'The Walking' Bourne.\n\nOf the 4 Damon Bourne movies I'd rank it at the bottom.", "Am I the only one who is pissed they didn't develope the potential romance with Nicky? \n\nUltimatum made it seem like they had a history together, then she's killed off in the first 15 minutes...disappointing", "Oh look a bowl of free tracking devices. Oh look another bowl of free stealth microphones.\n\nLaziest writing ever.", "They cut the \"Jesus Christ it's Jason Bourne\" line in the final cut I'm very salty", "Bourne felt like an amateur in this movie.\nSecret memory-stick?

Yeah, let's take over the phone and we can delete the files on the stick \u00d4o", "I feel like I watched a different movie compared to most here. \n\nThat whole Greek Riot sequence was awesome. ", "It was good, not great. Miles better than Legacy was, but not as good as the original trilogy. I thought it could have been a lot better if they removed the side plot with knock off Mark Zuckerberg. That whole side plot was very unnecessary. Take that out, add a little bit more of the main plot, and I think the movie would have been much better for it. That being said, the performances were all great, and the action was top notch. It was good seeing Damon and Greengrass together again. 7.5/10", "Saw it the other night. Kinda meh but still entertaining.  At first I thought it was a Fight Club crossover..  Matt and Julia definitely looked a lot older, but I guess it's been nearly 10 years since the last Matt Damon Bourne movie.\n\nNicky's death seemed a bit pointless, I thought in one of the earlier movies they implied a bit more history between the two of them but they didn't go into that.\n\n", "I still think it should have been called \"The Rebourne Identity\", it just makes so much sense.", "Purely from an action film standpoint, I'd say the movie was great.  The pace is brisk, the music never stops adding to the sense of urgency and anticipation, and overall it has some decent set pieces.  The scenes out of Greece and Vegas are great.  Very much a grand scale to much of the action.\n\nHowever, as a Bourne film, it is definitely a step back.  Honestly I found Bourne to be more of a supporting character in this movie rather than the focal point.  In general terms of plot points, and of course this is riddled with spoilers, there's only so much past-digging they can do with Bourne.  This movie became about Bourne's father and his ultimate demise, but honestly it seemed like flimsy motivation for Nicky to bring Bourne back into the CIA's purview.  Out of everyone she should have known Bourne wanted left alone.  It all seemed resolved after Ultimatum.  I think she should have known her actions would attract attention.\n\nI also didn't fully understand Nicky's relationship with the hacker character Christian.  Was it a mutual interest in bringing down the corrupt CIA?  That was the hacker's motivation, as he outright stated it when he was with Bourne.  I guess Nicky was just wanting to out \"Iron Hand\" that she discovered either before or after hacking the CIA.  I'm not entirely sure.  I suppose these things can be explained in the end, it just didn't feel quite as crisp as the original movies.  Then the hacker attacks Bourne, and for what reason?  That seemed unnecessary.\n\nNext we have the CIA/Deep Dream side-plot that didn't involve Bourne at all, lending credence to the idea that he was more of a support character in this film.  If they had found a way to tie Bourne into that it would have worked better, but instead it seemed more about setting up the CIA director (Tommy Lee Jones) as an evil man that needed to be exterminated.  Again, as an action film it wasn't all bad, but this had nothing to do with the Bourne character.\n\nA lot of the \"techno-babble\" was immersion-killing.  It was really lazy writing.  These are decade-old tropes being trotted out in the movie to either simplify things or otherwise cut corners and I did not like those aspects of the movie.  I'm not sure what they were going for there.  Same with our intro to Deep Dream.  Why is everyone giving a guy a standing ovation for saying, \"you're not being spied on!\"  As if he can't lie to all of them.  Again, sort of killed the immersion.  Some of other issues involving Bourne again felt really simplified for the sake of time and/or effort (the Vegas convention immediately comes to mind).\n\nI didn't have too much problem with the asset looking for revenge.  Being captured and tortured for two years would leave most people pretty angry at the responsible party.  It was a stretch to see him as the assassin in the past, but even that I can deal with to an extent.  His presence was largely the thing to bring the two opposing plots to a head.  I feel like it would have made more sense for the CIA to try and frame Bourne at the end, though, instead of some random invented \"Iraqi National.\"\n\nI do miss the camera work from the first film.  The \"shaky cam\" got progressively worse as the series went on, culminating in Ultimatum's \"can't tell what's happening\" fight scenes.  I feel as though the shaky cam was a bit less severe in this, but it was still quite bad.  Unfortunately I guess if you have not-so-good fight choreography, this is how you mask it.  I have been spoiled growing up and watching Jackie Chan and other non-American movies.\n\nOverall:  I think the movie does well as an action film, but is not necessarily much of a *Bourne* movie.  It only tangentially fits in with the rest of them.  Matt Damon felt relegated to a supporting role; as has been pointed out he had fairly limited dialogue.  The writing was absolutely the weakest of all the films.  I will say the movie was entertaining, it is just unfortunate that the movie is better the *less* you think about it.\n\nI would rate this movie higher as an action film than a *Bourne* film.  For the latter, I'd say this is the worst of the original trilogy but better than Legacy, which I just couldn't get into for whatever reason.\n\nIf they end up making another one, which wouldn't surprise me, I'd really like to see a return to what made the first three movies great, including making Bourne the focus, but they can't keep digging into his past.  They have to find another direction to go.", "I was confused as fuck why at the end, the other  director guy said heathers plan was an interesting one. That was the same plan they just had.", "Bourne participating in underground Fight Clubs was a super lame way to burnish his tough guy cred. \n\nThe hacking/technology in this movie was bad even for hollywood.\n\nThe Heather Lee character was pretty interesting.\n\nThe fight scenes and chase scenes were pretty cool.\n\n7/10", "It's an alright movie but not nearly as good as the original trilogy. The first warning sign was when Nicki left Bourne a note about meeting her at the protest....whyy?? Why not just wait 2 min and talk to him right then and there at his bloodsport get-together? And that's another thing..why would Bourne be spending his time street fighting for a couple of bucks? I would think he's had enough of that by the end of the 3rd movie and would've had a quiet job on a farm or something. And it would have taken something extraordinary to bring him back into the spotlight....not some murky plot about his spy dad and social media...\n\nI had a big problem with the direction they took the character, as well as the character not behaving the way we expect him to behave. Was it just me or did anyone else think that Bourne get seemed bloated, confused, and unusually emotional about things he's had a decade to figure out? He wasn't he intense, calculating, force of nature I remember.... the original films had a certain intensity, momentum, and rhythm that was mostly missing here... it's hard to think that Tony gilroy made such a difference...esp since legacy was also disappointing...\n\nBut some things that I liked and see potential in are the chase sequences and Alicia vikander (although her characters motivations at the end were confusing...making the 'extreme ways' song totally unearned). Hopefully the next one will be better", "I have to say I'm really surprised at all the positive comments about Alicia Vikander. This is unlikely but the wording almost makes me wonder if PR is writing some of these comments. Or this sub has an irrational love for her like they did of JLaw and will eventually start tearing her down. \n\nFor me, she was one of the worst parts of the film. So expressionless and robotic, her voice was grating and don't even get me started on the accent. Not even good eye candy. \n\nUsing SQL to hack things? Cringe. You would think a film of this caliber would do a better job of things like this but no. So amateurish. ", "Wow, this movie was incredibly disappointing. Bourne had seemingly no motivation, killing Nicky made no sense, the hacking stuff was incredibly contrived and just plain stupid. The script was also really weak, it felt so incredibly clich\u00e9 in some spots. Essentially none of the plot points were resolved. ", "Tommy Lee Jones was hilarious in this movie. That bit in the restaurant where he just stops mid-conversation and stares at the guys walking past......did he think the scene had ended? ", "I rather liked it. It's not my favorite Bourne movie, but it's miles better than Legacy and stands tall among the original trilogy.", "If you didn't watch the previous movies, then this felt like a long and shitty DLC where the developers did nothing to add to the Bourne plot albeit insufferable camera work and the blandest characters you've ever seen.", "It wasn't amazing but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Them enhancing that picture really bothered me though.", "Am I the only one confused about what Bourne was actually after in the movie? Initially he's just following the trail of breadcrumbs that Nicky left him and finds out his dad started the program and was assassinated, but then what's his goal after that when he goes for the CIA director? Was it really just to kill him? Because he doesn't even do that, and it didn't seem like he was going to before he got interrupted by the agents, and that conversation he had with the director didn't clear anything up, so what was he actually trying to accomplish? ", "How are people not saying this isn't a bad movie? Worst bourne yet. At least tied at the bottom with Legacy. Jesus there was no fucking storyline at all. ", "Seems like I'm in the minority, but I thought Legacy was better. This movie is ok, but nothing sticks out. Legacy at least had some moments such as the cabin with Oscar Issac, Renner climbing the house, the Manila factory, etc. It also had genuinely interesting story elements. I think one of the staples of the series is the discussions that the CIA and top level guys have between themselves when dealing with Bourne. In this movie these scenes have such generic dialogue and the only interesting thing they mention is Iron Hand which turns out to be some boring surveillance program.", "So many jump cuts couldn't tell shit", "I know we're beating a dead horse by now, but the shaky cam ruined my entire experience. Granted, I get motion sickness quite easily and I did experience it watching the first Bourne film on TV, but I've since watched all three Bourne movies 30+ times and have been fine. I'm such a huge fan, I figured that I'd be okay seeing this installment in theaters. Man, what a mistake, halfway through I was so sick and wanted to upchuck a couple of times, but seeing as I was already halfway invested, I didn't want to leave. I had to shut my eyes for last third of the film and really wanted to get up and leave during the last car chase but didn't want to ruin anyone else's experience during the chase. I tried watching the few moments of dialogue where I hoped there wouldn't be so much shaky cam but I was infuriated when **every** single moment involved shaky cam - Tommy Lee Jones having a conversation on the phone, Alicia Vikander standing still at the park, someone reading a text message! I mean, why?!? I won't get into a number of other criticisms I had of the film, since it's been well covered here, but I'll leave it as a fairly disappointing experience. ", "Oh god here comes a very nasty review:\n\nI think the plot was extremely flimsy. The acting was subpar. There were far too many conveniences and coincidences for me to take seriously.\n\nSo you have Nikki who is \"tech savvy\" who needs to get information to Bourne. Upon meeting him, instead of just telling him what she knows, she tells him to meet in the middle of a riot. This is all convenient to the plot to set up the idea of the Greek government putting up a parameter and getting her to her very predictable character death. A character death that was treated very briefly and unceremoniously for Nikki, despite her being involved in the last three films and also hinted at having had a past with Bourne. To be tossed aside so quickly seemed unfair. Oh and her last action is to throw her thumb drive at him. The one that says \"ENCRYPTED\" on it so no one gets confused.\n\nCan't forget the made-for-TV technobabble like the \"SQL to corrupt their database\" in the beginning, the infamous \"Enhance\", hacking a laptop because there is a cell phone nearby. For a spy movie in a franchise that readily has people use information warfare and tracking in various ways the characters seem very incapable when all it would take to get them off your back is to just turning off the wifi/internet and they couldn't even do that. Is this a crossover movie with NCIS? \n\nWhat chance did the skinny computer hacktivist think he had in attacking Bourne? That guy was so cheesy. \n\nSo while travelling Bourne gets on the internet and sees Heather has a quote in a publication that basically says \"I am a good guy\", so he now he trusts her and even takes a phone from her even tho that's how he has been tracked the whole time anyways.\n\nBourne conveniently starts having new flashbacks for plot.. reasons. They're about his dad! His dad conveniently started this whole mess. So in the next movie expect Bourne to have more flashbacks but about his mother. She might also have once been the chairman of the NSA or something.\n\nLets not gloss over the Asset who gets assigned to this mission. These spy programs have been going on a while now and we know that they have lots of Assets(4 in Identity I think, 1 in Supremacy, 2 or 3 in Ultimatum maybe) so they have options surely! Wait, this is also the guy who happened to kill his dad maybe 25 years ago? What are the odds! I guess this is a revenge movie now. But he has beef with Bourne because Bourne betrayed America, so I guess that makes it OK to shoot 4 of his fellow CIA guys in the back of the head just to show how serious he is.\n\nThey then go to a tech convention which happens to have unguarded \"Real Time Tracking Devices\" and \"Hidden Cameras\" for Bourne to take. Wait why are they at a tech convention? Oh yea they shoe-horned in this diverging subplot about a social media service so they can get some kind of social commentary into the movie, but we spend so much time with this separate plotline that you'd think Bourne is the sub-plot. Also why did the CIA director and the media guy not want to be seen together, but then they go to a public restaurant?\n\nAt the end, the Asset gets hurt and is outed by security, so being the subtle assassin he is, he proceeds to kill a SWAT guy in a crowd and steals the SWAT truck(even tho there are probably a thousand other cars or escape routes possible), and demolishes traffic in the middle of bustling Vegas. The chase scene proceeds as he smashes his way through at least 15-20 multi-ton cars only to come to and end when his wrecking ball of destruction gets impeded by an immovable row of slot machines.\n\nHeather's motivation was not really clear. She wants to help Bourne because he seemed like he wasn't acting like he was trying to bring down the CIA, but then she may have been helping so she can stop Tommy Lee Jones because he sabotages her field mission(and who would think she is qualified to be in the field to track a super spy anyways?), and then she kills him so she can move from working the tech department to being CIA chairman. But Bourne telling her that he'll think about it queue's the credits theme like its some super clever victory. But really we were never really invested in how it might be a victory because her motivations really weren't as clear as the movie thinks they are. \n\nTommy Lee Jones was phoning it in. \n\nAlicia Vikander's accent was all over the place.\n\nThe fight scene with the spot light was cool tho. The set pieces were nice. I didn't hate the camera work. What little we got of Bourne doing his thing was good. The movie in which these things inhabit was a dud. Wait for it to come on TV and watch it while you're doing something else. 4/10\n\nI love the original trilogy, but this seemed so dumbed down. It was like they ran out of ideas. All of the world they had built in the previous 3 installments created a sense of realism and grittiness that made it cool. The camera style gave them an almost documentary like feeling. That level of verisimilitude was entirely lost on the new film and Legacy(lets not get into that and its super soldier candy).", "I find it hard to believe that this was the best story they could come up with. I seem to remember Damon and Greengrass saying they would only do another Bourne if the script was good. Well, guys, it wasn't. The whole movie felt like an over-the-top season of Homeland.\n\nI hated the new backstory. Why did they have to shoehorn David Webb's father into this and make him the creator of the Treadstone program? They couldn't come up with a bigger cliche even if they tried. Ok, so Webb was practically destined to become Bourne? What bullshit. Why couldn't they just keep things simple and make him be one of many in the program? One of the myriad assets they seem to have in every European city? I find that much more interesting.\n\nThe best part of the movie was the Greek riot sequence. Riveting stuff. The rest was just meh and I was even greatly disappointed by Vikander.", "Saw it yesterday with my girlfriend.\n\nWe both thought it was pretty bad. I felt as though the action scenes were lame - lots of camera shake / camera changing in order to hide the tired / old Matt Damon and poor fight choreography. Also the main car chase scene near the end was incredibly drawn out in order to show how awesome the dodge was, even though the scene itself felt slow or low speed / boring because of poor editing (tons of camera shake to make it look tense, which made it even more annoying).\n\nMy girlfriend didn't like it because the plot was just plain weak, which I completely agree. There wasn't really a purpose for Matt Damon's character to reappear. It should have been \"we have a great story that we should bring Matt Damon back for,\" but instead it was \"let's just bring Matt Damon back for another movie.\"\n\nAlso\n\n\"Use SQL to corrupt the database\"\n\n\"enhance\"\n\nLet's be connected to the internet when we look at these files so the CIA can find us!\n\nLet's kill off a past character in order to bring in someone younger with perkier tits\n\nLet's have the asset kill random people for no reason\n\nLet's go where there is a huge riot, police, and cameras to talk about the CIA files I stole! \n\nYeah, disappointing all around\n", "Enjoyed it a lot. Damon is excellent as always and it was great to see him back in this role, Tommy Lee Jones is the perfect mean old prick, Alicia Vikander was terrific and it was also nice to see Julia Stiles as Nicky again.\n\nI liked how they went further into Bourne's past in away that didn't feel unnecessary like it did in Spectre, Nicky getting killed caught me off guard, in a good way, and the action is some of the most exciting I've seen in a while. The Athens chase is spectacular and the final car chase/hand to hand fight had me on the edge of my seat. I also didn't feel like they didn't overload it with action, as after the Athens scene it feels like a more gradual build up to the finale. Bourne and Heather had a good 'sort of but not really trusting each other' relationship that I enjoyed, as well as how that worked with the Tommy Lee Jones plot.\n\nWhile I did really like that they gave the asset in this one a backstory involving the events of Ultimatum, I thought it was a bit too much of a coincidence that he was also the one who killed Bourne's dad. That reveal just fell for me. I also found that there were quite a few leaps in logic, such as when Heather deleted files from the laptop by hacking into a phone that was in the same room as the laptop. Now I don't know much about hacking but that seemed like total nonsense to me. There was also a scene in the Vegas part where Bourne just happened to come across two useful gadgets that he needs for the plot to move along, which had helpful signs to tell him exactly where to find them. Small moment but it just felt like a lazy way to keep the plot moving along and it works against the idea that Bourne is highly capable and can improvise with anything, when he just happens to come across handy spy gadgets. I didn't feel that the subplot with Aaron Kallor deviated too much from the main plot, although I guess it could have been trimmed a little bit.\n\nYeah I really enjoyed it, its not without flaws but as a solid action movie with an intriguing story it worked very well for me. A worthy entrance to the series that left me wanting to see where these characters could go next.", "Didn't like it all that much. It's just a boring, uninspired retread of Greengrass' other two Bourne films. The writing of Tony Gilroy is sorely missed.", "This movie was so disappointing. It wasn't even bad. It was just boring? It felt like it had nothing to say. No real, proper 'fuck yeah' Bourne moments until the end when it just felt sorta half assed. Vikander was great, but Damon felt like he was coasting a bit. Tommy Lee Jones did a decent job though as well as Vincent Cassel.\n\nI guess in the end I just didn't believe that Bourne would get roped back into all this so easily. I have a weird suspicion though that this might be a movie I reevaluate when/if another comes out though. ", "Wow shocked lots of people are disappointed in it I liked it thought. It didn't add any valuable information but the riot scenes were great fight scene were awesome too. I didn't think it was good as the second ", "Unfortunately, this film suffers from zoomed in shots, CONSTANT EDITS, (we don't need 5 per second during a fight), and stale dialogue/performances from certain people(Nikki and Tommy Lee Jones). However Alicia Vikander and Matt Damon did a great job. Sad how it turned out as I love the original trilogy. Action scenes are rushed and it's difficult to tell what is going on. Please let the franchise end here. 5/10", "The Good:\n\n- When it comes to action, Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon make a great team, and it's once again evident here through superb action sequences and some of the best action set pieces in recent memory. There's a tension in every fight, a raw brutality that Greengrass captures perfectly, even if shakily (as is his style).\n\n- Music is great\n\n- Cast is well assembled and mostly fair well.\n\n- Pacing is quick, yet plot gets a good amount of time.\n\n- Has themes topical today\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The plot may get focus, but I don't think it shines. I don't find the story particularly engaging or justifies its existence after a pretty tight trilogy.\n\n- Killing off Nicky felt unnecessary as there was more potential for her character (such as her prior relationship with Bourne) and her death seemed like a typical \"Woman in the fridge\" moment.\n\n- Alicia Vikander, while I like her, seemed a bit out of her element. I couldn't quite deduce what she was going for.\n\n- The dialogue seemed very generic, especially for a Bourne film. \n\n- Dewey came across as mustache twirlingly evil in some scenes, vs the moral ambiguity of other Bourne villains IMO.\n\n- The action sequences towards the end began to lose a lot of the realistic grounding of the series.\n\n- The movie as a whole followed the Bourne formula a bit too closely\n\n- Bourne would have benefited from more dialogue, as it could make scenes such as his father's death more impactful imo\n\nAll in all: Jason Bourne suffers from many writing problems. Whether it's the absence of Gilroy or a book to at least partially build the foundation on, I can't quite tell. I'm not adverse to another Bourne, but better writing is needed. 5/10\n\nFor Comparison:\n\nThe Bourne Identity: 8/10\n\nThe Bourne Supremacy: 9/10\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum: 10/10\n\nHaven't watched Legacy yet, intend to soon.\n", "It's hilarious that they basically did this movie out of spite from the series attempting to continue with Bourne Legacy and the movie sucks, possibly more than Legacy which could have been redeemed a bit through a proper sequel.", "Really looking forward to this one, despite the bad reviews.

Bring on the new one!", "[deleted]", "Surprised at how dull Alicia Vikander was here. She had one facial expression and sounded like a dispassionate drone the whole time. \n\nI did like the twist where she ended up being the secret villain though; I thought she'd just let Bourne get away like everyone else.\n\nAlso I genuinely found myself wondering why Vincent Cassel went on a rampage all over Vegas at the end. Was he trying to lure Bourne? If he genuinely wanted to escape, killing a SWAT guy and stealing his truck was a terrible idea with all the regular people around.\n\nGenerally the film felt far more reliant on contrivance than the prior ones. I loved the idea of Cassel being mad for having his cover blown as it makes the film feel more politically balanced, but throwing in him killing Bourne's dad just felt very convenient and soap operaish.", "Not getting all the hate this movie is getting...like holy shit its not even fresh on RT..

Clearly sort of depressed at the start of the movie and overall sort of a little lost and questioning things. \n- Adapted nicely to modern times. Everyone is a little scared these days of big data collection, surveillance by the government in cooperation with social media companies, etc.\n- Darker and practically dystopian vision of the US government's surveillance etc. The entire program seemed practically out of control with people within the agency backstabbing each other, innocents getting liberally killed by unstable agents, etc.\n- Crazy fake terrorist attack conspiracy theory subplots fit in well with the dystopian world.\n- awesome final act, loved the tension leading up to the assassination attempt, thought the car chase was beautiful, nice and brutal final brawl. \n- the fact that Bourne was sort of being outsmarted by modern tech made a lot of sense to me. An interesting new development to have the CIA be tracking him so closely without him having any clue. \n- pacing was satisfying, better than supremacy in that area I think. Nice opening action, then a steady and interesting buildup to a wild finale.\n\nThings I didn't like - \n\n- The fact that the rival agent just so happens to have been the one to kill Bourne's father felt contrived.\n- leaving the ending so ambiguous felt like a mistake.

After the disappointment of Legacy, my dad and I were anxious for a return of Matt Damon as Bourne and when we heard that he was to return with Paul Greengrass we were excited. Naturally, we went to see it yestserday night and we were not dissapointed! Even with the social media subplot being kind of out of place, everything else was just what I wanted out of a Bourne film.

I get that people were hoping for a fresh air after all these years without Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass in control (not to mention the fact that, again, The Bourne Legacy was an actual letdown even though Jeremy Renners did an impressive work). And I get how people might've felt about the movie basically being the same thing we've seen in the others (Bourne gets chased by CIA, he discovers secrets of his past, big man in suit wants him dead, etc), but the thing that's bothering me a lot is how many people are shitting on this movie because it's the same formula as The Bourne Trilogy, but they were the ones that glorified Star Wars: The Force Awakens even though they rehashed the plot of A New Hope.

It's about two guys who have 'One bad day' and through it they turn into The Batman and The Joker. The Joker believes that everyone has their limit -  a breaking point -  while Batman believes in Law and Justice. What 'The Killing Joke' comic does is test once and for all if their rivalry truly is an immovable object meeting an unstoppable force, Batman starts to think the unthinkable and contemplates killing The Joker, while the Joker conceives of a crime that he thinks will prove his world view right once and for all.\n\nIt is the ultimate clash of beliefs that climaxes in one of the best cliffhangers in comics.\n\nThe comic is fundamentally a summation of the relationship between Batman and The Joker but they made this whole movie about Batgirl - it was the parts of the movie referencing 'The Killing Joke' comic that ended up feeling out of place. \n\nBruce Timm knows all of this so I can't fathom why he chose to make a movie about Batgirl instead, he knew this comic had the same reverence amongst fans like the 'Watchmen' comics have so why couldn't he approach this in the same way Zack Snyder (Whatever his other faults) did with his adaption?\n\nIf you want to make a Batgirl movie then pick a Batgirl comic, this comic was about The Joker and The Batman pushing each other to their very limits.", "I was looking forward to the Batgirl prologue thinking it would be about 5 minutes, but it going on for half an hour was beyond tedious. I don't even hate Barbara and Bruce having roof sex because it wasn't in the comic but more for how it completely changes Batman's motivation to go after the Joker, reduces her character to a spurned lover who spends half of the prologue moping because Batman won't call her first and it puts an uncomfortable spin on Batman's friendship with Jim Gordon. The prologue is also just way too long and not nearly interesting enough to justify it. All I could think about was when The Killing Joke was actually going to start.\n\nOn the other hand everything regarding the Joker is absolutely incredible, I really think this is Mark Hamill's best Joker performance. He completely knocks it out of the park, be it the quieter parts of the flashbacks or the torturing of Gordon, along with the song that rides the line so perfectly between dark and funny. \n\nThe shift from the prologue to the main story was jarring but once it settles into it, its a lot better. Joker shooting Barbara and taking the photos is appropriately disturbing, as is the carnival scene towards the end. As I said I really take issue with the fact that Batman's motivations for going after the Joker change from being angry over his friends being hurt to him doing it because he maybe has feelings for Barbara. I don't know, it just kinda adds weird implications to his motivations. Also as great as the final confrontation is, something about the very end felt really off to me. Something about the transition from page to animation just didn't quite work there. I loved the joke and Batman laughing but it kinda messed with the ambiguous nature of the comic's ending.\n\nThe animation, while not as bad as the trailer suggested, does look like it could have done with some more work on it, although some of the fights do look decent.\n\nThe parts that work do really work and if you're a fan of the comic then I would maybe recommend watching for that stuff, but overall I was quite disappointed with this. The prologue should have been a quick 5 minutes to add more to Barbara's character, instead of half an hour to show her as a character that's only as important as the men in her life. Batman also comes off very odd here, with his relationships to both of the Gordon's being twisted into something rather uncomfortable. Its always great to have Hamill, Conroy and Strong reprising their animated series roles and Hamill is particularly terrific here, especially in his musical number. I can't really imagine going back to this like I have with other DC animated films, unless its without the first 30 minutes. Although even then I'd be better off just reading the comic again, which makes this feel a bit redundant, apart from getting to hear Hamill do his thing. This really should have been amazing, but somehow they managed to balls it up with a disappointing and disjointed adaptation. Also the after credits scene feels completely out of place.", "Saw a screening about thirty minutes ago. Disappointed. Batman and Batgirl's pointless hook up is pointless. Gay character is stereotypically gay and cringy. I've just now realised that The Paris Francis villain or whatever his name was serves no purpose to the story.

It had a WHOLE LOT going for it: Conroy, Hammil, and Strong reprising their roles, Azaarello of \"Joker\" fame writing the script, Batman: TAS brainchild Bruce Timm producing. With that kind of talent involved, the resulting product is almost inexcusable.\n\nAll the actual \"Killing Joke\" stuff is fine. It's not mind-blowingly great, it's not the definitive Joker film we all wanted to see from the definitive Joker story, but it's fine. Conroy and Hammil are masters of their craft, and finally hearing the speeches from the graphic novel coming out of Hammil's mouth was great. What little they changed wasn't hyper distracting, although I'd argue it also didn't add much. I would've preferred a funhouse mirror fight to (inexplicably I might add) being in Joker's apartment, I would've preferred the ending have the police sirens and the light in the puddle and it being less obvious that they were taking the side of \"Batman kills Joker in the end\", but like I said, it wasn't egregious.\n\nEverything else was absolutely terrible. Everything they added was so disconnected and irrelevant to the story of the Killing Joke, I almost half expected to watch the whole thing and realize I'd accidentally picked up the wrong movie. For reasons that have already been discussed to death, I HATED the introduction of a sexual relationship between Batman and Batgirl. This isn't only something that has only been done, like, once in like seventy years of both these characters existing, it's something that doesn't add anything to how the story progresses. They could have cut that scene and everything would have been the same. I genuinely don't understand why they did that.\n\nThe gay character. What the fuck was that? Did I hop in a time machine and accidentally start watching a raunchy comedy from 2004? Because what in the ever-living fuck was that? I'm 1000% all for getting more LGBTQ characters in movies, but I'm pretty against inserting it only when we need a \"gossipy bitch\" character. Every line out of him made me cringe because it felt like Azzarello had never actually met a gay man before and had only heard about them through shitty comedies from ten years ago.\n\nThe \"villain\", Paris Franz or whatever the fuck dumbass name they gave him, was garbage. His story wasn't compelling, his lines were all generic, but they were presenting him as if he was like this manipulative evil that broke Batgirl, when in reality, I could see his lines and his attitude coming from half the \"thug\" side characters in TAS or the Arkham games. And if you're doing a story where the Joker cripples and sexually assaults Barbara and shows the photos to her father, you can't have another \"totally messed up\" character, because he's just gonna be seen as lame by comparison. His whole plan and the whole first half hour just felt like a really misguided and unnecessarily gross episode of the Animated Series. And then WHAM! The Killing Joke starts. It's jarring. It wasn't necessary. Shoulda just been a 20 minute short.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's watchable, but temper your expectations. The animation is painfully average (seriously, watch Flashpoint Paradox and then this and it looks like they made this ten years prior), the added story is two parts baffling one part boring, and the actual Killing Joke material seemed like a paint-by-the-numbers film instead of the passionate homage it could have been.\n\n4/10", "First of all, you must know that The Killing Joke is my favourite comic book of all time. However, I wasn't on the edge of my seat waiting for this movie. I was stoked when it was announced, but in time I became just moderately curious.\n\nAlso, I swear that my issues with the movie are not due to the \"it's not identical to the comic\" syndrome. I am open minded, I think. I am ok with change if it is done with purpose and it is interesting, positive or smart.\n\nI honestly hated this movie. I was shocked by the end. I was not expecting this movie to be so bad. I thought that the worst they could do is downgrade it to \"pretty good\", but I never thought that they could actually make it terrible.\n\nI'll go in depth for this, because I want to explain exactly what I think is wrong with it and I don't want you to think I just dimissed it without giving it a chance or analysing it.\n\nThe pros:\n\n- The animation is fine, it's competent. The trailers were poorly done and made it look choppy. It's pretty fluid and stylized. It is not the best of DC, but it's fine.\n\n- I liked the idea (conceptually) of Batman fearing that Barbara will be stuck in a destructive relationship with a sociopath, just like he is stuck in one with Joker. But it was poorly developed. Also, it's the kind of story you do on its own, rather than sticking it in the first act of another story.\n\n- Voice acting was great (duh). We all love these people.\n\n- Some added details were neat, like the creepy grinning corpses. Nothing new or necesssary, but I love me some creepy Joker murders.\n\n- It is nice to see some things taken straight from the comic and done fairly loyally; I liked the flashback scene when Joker sees himself for the first time, the \"one bad day\" monologue the final laughter together and hearing Hamill and Conroy say some lines that I always loved. It was also clever how they kept the ambiguity of the ending by having Joker stop laughing as Batman keeps going. Kudos.\n\n- I liked the easter eggs, especially the references to more recent Joker stories (as seen on the Batcomputer).\n\n- I thought Joker's song was handled pretty well. Not as great and creepy as I imagined it, but maybe nothing can meet those expectations and I want to be fair; it was good.\n\n- I like the design of the factory where Joker falls into the acid. It's different from the comics, it's taller and spookier. Nice.\n\nNow the cons. Be warned, I have many gripes with this movie:\n\n- The actual Killing Joke starts after half an hour of another story centered around Barbara. The idea of making her a central character is something I understand and can respect if it comes from good intentions. However, The Killing Joke is about Batman and Joker and the only result, by adding this whole new story, is that they had two under-developed stories, rather than one great one.\n\n- The idea of making Batman and Barbara be lovers is in and of itself pretty bad, imo. But it was handled horribly either way. FOr one, I find it creepy that Batman would have sex with someone whom he instructed and who he taught to. Sorry, but I do. It's like a college teacher having sex with one of his students. Yeah, it's legal. But it's also sleazy. I also hated hearing Barbara say she likes a controlling guy in a relationship. Seriously? Barbara fucking Gordon? One of the strongest female characters out there? Screw you, movie.\n\n- I hated how much of a dick Batman was in the first act. I know what they were going for; the classic \"Batman keeps people away by trying to protect them\" thing. Fine. But he just came off as a douche. I also hated how having sex ruins their relationship and how weak of a character Barbara was; needing to prove herself to him, be desired by him and venting with her coworker in a manner that's more fitting to a sitcom.\n\n- Let's just say it; her co-worker was a gay stereotype. Talked like a stereotype, only talked about men, had no personality beyond \"gay\" and it was honestly unbeliavably awful and offensive. To common decency, to gay people and to those of us who do not like lazy writing.\n\n- The secondary villain, the guy who is attracted by Barbara, was awful and so was everything revolving around him. Yeah, I really needed to see a guy pay a prostitute to wear a Batgirl mask in The Killing Joke. Great job. And his motivation and criminal misdeeds were boring, boring, boring. It felt like lazy and kind of gross filler.\n\n- Stupid fan service. I'm not a fan of fan service; but it is less obnoxious in stories that are more action-driven or cheesy. In The Killing Joke, it just sticks out like a sore thunb. In the comic, Barbara was dignified. Here, they miss no chance to show her ass, her boobs, her panties, her bra. It was pathetic. In the original story she was a victim, yes, but she was treated with dignity. Here she goes from weak character that is exposed to get 12 year olds horny to victim and then we never see again. You see, while I think The Killing Joke is not the place to give Barbara a story about her as a strong female character, I can respect the intention. And maybe some people would argue that I dislike the movie because it's about her. But the problem is 1) that it's really not, after the first act, it feels really tacked on 2) if you want to write a story about female empowerment, you don't do everything you can to show the character's ass and boobs and have her be the appendix of the male characters. This was all filler, nothing else.\n\n- I was not fond of the music. I had high hopes for it. DC often has terrific music and this story is perfect from some awesome music. I was hoping for something on par with Christopher Drake's The Dark KNight Returns OST. It was dull and forgettable.\n\n- The visuals and graphic, excluding a few shots, were mostl bland and boring. They didn't even give a different look to most of the flashbacks (which is a great detail in the comic). It felt paint-by-numbers in most parts.\n\n- They gave it to Brian azzarello. I do not hate the guy, but he uses the same style with everything he writes and his noir style does not go well with everything. And he had previously done a terrible job with Alan Moore's world when he wrote Before Watchmen. He tries hard to be gritty, hard-boiled and violent but it's mostly awful here. \nHaving Joker be a frequent customer of prostitutes? What? Not to mention the various instances where he re-wrote Alan Moore-s words in his own style, making them worse. And not to mention all the other things I mentioned and I will mention, regarding the story.\n\n- They took out the awesome monologue about the deformity of the average man and instead added Batman punching around the circus guys. Riveting. Because that's what people love about TKJ, they love the punching scenes.\n\n- The movie is so filled with padding and new, useless stuff, that the central themes of the movie and the core emotions are lost of almot lost. The comic is about people's breaking point, chance and chaos, good and evil. It asks why we become who we are, whether we can choose to be different and whether we can control anything about our life or who we are. All this has little space in the movie and it made me really sad.\n\n- Untill the final confrontation, I was mostly uninterested in Batman and Joker. My two favourite characters of all time. I don't know how that's even possible, but the movie just made me bored and uninterested in them.\n\n- The death of Joker's wife is handled really poorly. No emotion, no music, almost no decent lines. In the comic, it hits you hard. And they took out the powerfully effective shot of Joker, crippled with pain, among the drunk people in the bar. It just comes and goes.\n\n- The dialogues, when not taken from the comic, were laughable or horrid, most of the time. The secondary villain tells Barbara \"must be that time of the month\". Seriously? And Batman's monologue about the void and the loss of hope was cringe-worthy. The concept was fine and appropriate, but it was put in such a silly, simplistic way. As if Azzarello did not understand it.\n\n- So much padding. Any chance they got.\n\n- The idea of putting Gordon to trial was recycled from BTAS, it took time away from better moments that are actually in the comic and it was the wrong theme. Joker trying to prove that Batman is a criminal and Gordon is a hypocrite has nothing to do with the themes of the story. It's about proving that we can all break, not about undermining Batman's credibility or Gordon's. It's not that superficial.\n\n- The final joke is told really quickly, almost as if they were eager to end it. It was weird, I always thought the joke was supposed to be told slowly and passionately, like a good comedian would. Also, no music or anything to make the moment more powerful.\n\n- Having the dumb first act ruined the circular structure of the story, with the rain opening and closing the tale.\n\nThey had a perfect story and they blew it. It's a 4/10 for me. I am amazed, I didn't think it was possible to make The Killing Joke into a bad story. I would be very surprised if someone who has not read the comic will love this movie and feel it's deep or compelling. I expect most new fans to think it's, at best, fun. And wonder why the comic is praised as high art.\n\nI think it's a bad adaptation, a bad stand alone story and a waste of potential.\n\nIf someone who likes it reads this, please don't be offended. I'm happy that you do. This is just my opinion.\n\nBut I really, really hated this. I wasn't even that hyped for it in the end and it still let me down a lot.", "I liked it", "They were always going to get a lot of mixed opinions when making this movie due to how important it is. It started with the art style and when the movie officially comes out I can see there being more problems that people have. I don't think it was awful, but I don't think it was great either. I think it's just a very underwhelming adaption of an iconic novel, where instead of sticking to it in the way that they should (story, style and so on), they try and spice things up a bit, and largely for the worse.\n\n* The opening 30-40 minutes is a Barbara Gordon story. Personally I found it incredibly boring, so thankfully the cut off point for this story is pretty obvious so if I want to rewatch it I know where I can cut off. The Killing Joke is all about Batman and the Joker, and the stuff we see in this opening is largely irrelevant, and feels made to pad out the length because it'd be risky to release a 45 minute movie or something.\n\n* Barbara is handled poorly, with a lot of her scenes being about her slight obsession with Batman, and there's an incredibly out of place sex scene between her and Batman on a rooftop that just doesn't work because of what we've seen so far. Nothing to do with age, it just doesn't work the way it was intended in my opinion due to the character we see on screen and the situation going on at the time. She feels very much like an infatuated schoolgirl ala Annie in the early seasons of Community. Considering Barbara is largely irrelevant to The Killing Joke, this just makes her even more of a pain to watch.\n\n* I have my issues with the art style, but it is absolutely a scene breaker during the flashbacks, particularly the first one during what is meant to be an emotional scene between Joker and his wife. It just looks terrible, his emotions aren't properly shown and these scenes are so bloody iconic and I was bored out of my mind due to the bland direction and the animations. Hamill tries his best but everything else about the scene just falls flat.\n\n* The art style/direction also fail to bring out some of the iconic images from the comic. For example the Joker reveal, or the shot of the fairground seller up close after he's been killed, they even fucking butchered the final shot! Just so frustrating and I found myself shaking my head. Major, major cock up here.\n\n* The flashbacks really affected the pacing. I just don't think they were implemented as well as they could have, with jarring scene transitions that don't feel like they aid the narrative as well as they should. Joker's origin scene is also rushed, he falls into the vat of chemicals and ends up out of the sewage pipe within about 5 seconds. I don't know, maybe it's just me but for something quite iconic for the character I was hoping we'd see a bit of his desperation as he's drowning in the water or something. \n\nOverall, yeah i'm pretty disappointed. I feel there's some good here in the voice acting, and I think Conroy is at his best here for sure, and do I really need to say how great Hamill is? It's just a shame the two iconic voices aren't supported by a great movie, because there was so much potential here that has just been butchered due to the changes in the story or some of the shots, and quite mediocre direction which has led to iconic scenes feeling both jarring and emotionless.\n\nI think it'll get a lot of criticism and continues DC's current trend of disappointing animated movies. I think that the R rating cost them big time in terms of what they were able to convey through animations and art style, but I just wish instead of spending time on the tacked on Batgirl opening, they instead polished The Killing Joke 45 minutes to the best it could be. I know that would have been a hard sell, a 45 minute direct to DVD movie, but still.\n\nTL;DR: The Killing Joke is a disappointing adaption of an iconic graphic novel with some solid voice acting, which is let down due to it's story additions, direction and art style.", "Huge fan of the original graphic novel. Was bored out of my mind during the movie and creeped out at the sexualization of Barbara during some scenes.", "I felt like the main problem with the Batgirl prologue, more so than all the problems others have mentioned, was that when the Killing Joke story actually kicked in, it became completely irrelevant. Batman didn't really act any different with the added backstory or seem like it affected him at all once the Joker came into the story.\n\nI see where they were going with it, but it didn't quite work. I wonder if the problems with the prologue could have been fixed by a little editing. Maybe trimming some of the less relevant inter workings of whatever that crime family was and the library stuff, and intertwining that prologue story as a flashback of Batman's from his perspective to more parallel the Joker's flashbacks and kinda keep it more on the \"one bad day\" theme. Or adding a bit more emotion in the hospital scene to show that the prologue actually has some consequence on the rest of his actions thought the story. \n\nObviously there were a lot of other things that weren't working, but It would have helped I think to have taken a different approach to that particular idea.", "[deleted]", "The whole point of the first act is to mirror the last one. Bruce Wayne experiences a psychological trauma that causes him to become Batman. The Joker experiences psychological trauma that turns him into the Joker. Barbara Gordon, on the other hand, is still Barbara Gordon. Her identity isn't Batgirl, it's a role she plays at night. She's good at it, but makes mistakes because it's not who she is. When she does experience some kind of psychological trauma from watching Batman possibly die, her identity doesn't fundamentally change. She resumes her life as Barbara Gordon. Batman is uniquely Batman.\n\nThe last act we see the same type of arc play out with Commissioner Gordon. The Joker breaks him down psychologically, but he doesn't fundamentally change who Gordon is.

WB would probably not be willing to fund an animated short, they required it be feature length to sell it better. They probably also rushed it to get it out in time to coincide with Suicide Squad's release which would explain the low quality animation but that's another matter. So they had to add stuff to reach feature length, but the last thing they wanted to do was change or add anything to the actual Killing Joke material as that would be sacrilege. Their solution was to do 30 minutes of completely unrelated stuff in the beginning so Killing Joke could go unaltered. I can respect that, in a way. It certainly wasn't good by any means, but at least they refrained form messing with the Killing Joke stuff too much to pad the length.\n\nBut I absolutely can not understand what in the world they were thinking with that sex scene.

The ending and Jokers story are done so matter of the fact you can blink and they're over.\n\nIMO this was a comic that should not have been adapted, it's just too psychological and therefore doesn't translate to animation. This seemed like unnecessary fanservice just so Hamill could read the famous Joker dialogue.\n\nAnimaton quality was garbage as well IMO.  Just like BvS, they turned what was supposed to be a culmination and celebration of these characters and put out a disposable piece of work.\n\nSeems like everything WB touches turns to shit.", "People are being very, very hard on this movie when in reality it's a pretty good adaptation. The Barbara prologue was long but not very problematic, it actually was pretty fun. \n\nThings taken from the graphic novel were pitch perfect. Mark Hamill is a fantastic actor, and he sold the whole thing. I'm a bit tired so I kind of zoned out of the story, but I have the book so I can just look through that for it to hit me. \n\nThere are two problems for me, and time will tell if they're big or small.\n\n* Batman/Batgirl sex scene. Completely unneeded, poorly executed, kind of weird/gross. You can outright ignore it, just say Batman cares a lot for her and she has a dumb crush and it doesn't change the prologue (and the story we paid for) at all.

They give her a half hour story arc that's totally disconnected from The Killing Joke material, both thematically and plot-wise, then a pointless post-credits scene, but more screentime doesn't mean anything if there's no substance to it. Batgirl has a voiceover at the beginning of the movie where she essentially apologizes to the audience for being there instead of what we came to see. It's like the creative team knew it was a mistake, but they went through with it anyway.\n\nMaking a full on musical number out of the Joker's song doesn't work at all. The sequence with Batman fighting the freaks at the carnival is closer to something out of The Animated Series.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the character designs are mostly terrible, and the animation looks cheap, so it doesn't even have compelling visuals to enjoy.", "This was absolutely terrible. Hammil and Conroy were good. The writing was abysmal. The stuff with Batgirl is disgusting.

The long Batgirl prologue, the over sexualization of Barbra, the non emotional backstory of the Joker, etc.  But if I may attempt to defend the film for a moment, seeing as I think I enjoyed it more then anyone else here.\n\nThe Killing Joke is not the incredibly climactic showdown between these two characters.  It doesn't end in one or both of their deaths, it's not the Joker trying to blow up Gotham, or anything else that we are used to seeing.  The original purpose of the graphic novel was to demonstrate just how similar Batman and the Joker are to one another.  Both are so set in their ideals, their beliefs, and they both form from such similar backgrounds.  The whole \"one bad day\" speech is as close to a climax as the story gets.  \n\nIn order to appreciate this one off, you have to already have an appreciation for both of these characters.  The story serves to deepen an already well established universe and nothing more.  It's a look into the psyche of these two titans of good and evil, and while not perfect, I think the film explored that incredibly well.  \n\nThere's a fear batman has that one day he'll snap and kill the Joker.  We see that in this film.  There's the Joker's foundation for his chaos, his belief that he's not all that special, everyone's crazy.  \n\nThis film is far more then just a fist fight between nemeses, it's a battle of ideals, and it was refreshing to experience something so much simpler in the middle of films like BvS, Apocalypse, Civil War, Deadpool, etc.  \n\nIs the film flawed, of course, I have a lot of gripes with it, but don't hold it to a standard it cannot achieve.  Appreciate it for what it did.", "Copying and pasting from the old thread earlier today, if that's alright:\n\nNot good. Really *really* not good.\n\nI figured the animation quality was going to be its weakest part, but I was very wrong. It's definitely the least of its issues, but it's still important to address. \n\nI've seen comments across the web that have said, \"Yeah, but they're just going for a tweaked BTAS look!\" I really don't buy that. Yes, the character designs are very Bruce Timm, and that's absolutely fine -- in fact, they're pleasantly nostalgic. But that isn't the issue. It's the total lack of atmosphere thanks to the awful art direction.\n\nBATS was so good because it made great use of shadow, and had absolutely stunning background art. They made a point to draw on black paper to achieve this in many cases. It helped add texture to the image and create an interesting visual direction that was seldom found in cartoons at the time. This movie doesn't have any of that. It doesn't use shadow properly. It's flat, it's lifeless, and doesn't convey the mood this movie desperately needs. On only a few occasions where they're actively mimicking the comic do they do that, but seldom outside of it. The background art is equally as boring, and in some cases, actually really badly drawn. \n\nMost critically, and it's something they absolutely *had* to nail was the character acting. If you can't make these characters emote convincingly on top of the voice work, then what makes this better than reading the comic with some voices attached? The character animation is stiff, the fight scenes are badly storyboarded, and the reliance on CG is unpleasant, to say the least. They blew it. They really did.\n\nMoving on to the plot: I understand what they were going for, and building up a character before killing her off isn't a bad idea on paper, but I think the way they went about it was 1) horribly incongruous with the one of the rest of the film, and 2) totally misses the point of the comic. \n\nThe first half feels like an average BTAS episode. It's nostalgic, if a little uninspired. But then they throw in the sex scene between Batman and Batgirl and it totally changes the context of their relationship for when they eventually move into The Killing Joke's story. \n\nBatman and Jim Gordon are supposed to mirror one another in the comic. They've both been through hell thanks to the Joker, and the fact that they both play father figures to Barbara is a *huge* deal. Despite everything Jim went through, he still says to Batman, \"By the book!\" when it comes to apprehending the Joker. When you change Batman's role to a lover, you lose that essential image there. It was just a really lazy way of trying to tie in their prologue with the rest of the narrative to give Batman an obvious reason for being pushed over the edge.\n\nThat lack of subtlety extends much further than that, though. The lines from the hookers make it sound as though Joker *absolutely* raped Barbara. The hall of mirrors scene in the comic that was so visually interesting and important to the story's theme is altered so that it takes place in Joker's old apartment. The ending of the film has Joker stop laughing while Batman continues, which heavily implies Batman killed him. It just feels so on the nose. \n\nI think the performances themselves were quite good, though it definitely became apparent that the dialogue in the comic is very unnatural when read aloud. I wasn't sure whether that was simply the comic's fault or whether the director missed a trick there, but it occasionally felt a little awkward. Other than that, it was great. Mark Hamill was outstanding, and really showed some great range as a pre-Joker Joker. Impressive stuff.\n\nI just feel really let down on the whole, though. I wish I could just say, \"Hey, just start 30 minutes in and you'll have a great adaptation!\", but I can't. The aforementioned animation issues leave no sense of atmosphere, the changes to the story feel hamfisted, and the lack of subtlety kills so much of the magic of the comic. Really did not enjoy it, I'm afraid.

I suppose the reason the concept worked so well in the short film was that it wasn't stretched out to the length of a feature film. The concept was simple, you've got a monster that can't hurt you in the light, but the intensity isn't dragged out and is used to good effect in the short. After the first few scares in this however, I was more or less over the monster.

Teresa Palmer did a good job (particularly during an emotional scene right at the tail end of the film), Gabriel Bateman really surprised me as Martin. I thought he really sold his character. Brett (Alexander DiPersia) also really surprised me as he sort of broke the mould of the boyfriend archetype in horror films, which brings me to my next point; The characters, for once, aren't written as bland and lifeless people without a clue.

Id give 7/10", "Just saw it, the only downside was that I was a bit disappointed with the looks of Diana's face and the short run time.   Otherwise the tension and build up to the scares were top notch, some of the effects and ideas were cool and the character development and acting was great.  8/10, would see it again and recommend it to others.  ", "This movie was pretty decent. I thought the characters and performances of said characters were a lot more believable, grounded, and fleshed out than the average horror movie. One thing I also thought was fun was how physical they made Diana. As opposed to the more typical \"disembodied ghoul\" \"doors-closing-in-the-middle-of-the-night\" horror that's much more common today, Diana is a monster. She has a form, she's limited not just by light but by walls, doors, etc, and she scratches floors and people up. She's real. She's also of course a metaphor and I think the metaphor was carried out very clumsily due to the rather troubling implications it carries, but the extents to which the film goes to literalize Diana do, to their credit, soften that blow a bit. Mostly I think the impression it left me with is that I'm looking forward to the director's next picture. If there's one thing I have no gripes about in this movie it's the way the horror set pieces were constructed and shot. ", "Lights Out was a really good movie. Definitely worth the ticket price.\n\nPros: compelling drama with great characters. Very creative scares and lots of memorable moments. (I loved the part with the neon sign, and the bit with the gun was fucking dope.)\n\nCons: not very scary, at least not the way I saw it. I was with a big group in a crowded theater, and everyone was very chatty and very vocal about the movie.\n\nThis wasn't the annoying kind of horror crowd though, they were actually great. During the climax of the film, the audience was flipping the fuck out. So many screaming teenage girls. Everyone was super into the movie. The audience actually cheered at one moment. It was a lot of fun, even if it kinda prevented the movie from being scary.\n\nIf you're looking for a really fun horror movie with a great audience, you should check out this movie right away. It's definitely worth your time and money. But if you want to try to really immerse yourself in the film and get scared, you should wait a few days so that you can get a smaller audience. Although even then, I'm not sure how scary you'll find this movie. The scares are interesting and engaging for sure, but they have the same kind of pacing you see in every other horror movie, so you probably won't be super on edge.", "Pretty damn average at best - coming off of seeing \"The Conjuring 2\" a couple of weeks ago, this is no where near as creepy.\n\nSomeone else said it already, but it's worth repeating - I don't think there was a single jump scare in the film that wasn't in the trailers.", "Let down a lot by this movie.\n\nThe idea is great, it really plays on the age old issue of being afraid of the dark that we all had as children.\n\nThe mental illness angle was underdeveloped and made no impact. This was due to the underdeveloped mother-children relationship so the whole suicide at the end was weak and no one felt the pain that Rebecca was feeling.\n\nAlso there was so many parts that were ment to be scary but actually made me laugh.\n\nThe opening scene and the scene with the tattoo light were the best two by far.\n\n2/5 from me.", "I don't know if I can watch horror movies in theaters anymore. Nothing against the movie, it was fantastic, but God the crowd was horrible. I knew before it started that it was going to be an issue by the sheer amount of pretend but Jesus Christ. Do parents not teach their children how to behave in theaters anymore? Why is it okay to repeatedly say \"oh shit\" as loud as possible the duration of the entire fucking movie. I get if you're scared and react to the movie but for fucks sake you don't need to start making comments for the entire goddamn theater whenever suspense builds.", "Was I just imagining it or was Diana crawling around near the ambulance at the end before another cop car pulled up with more light?", "In my heart the moral to this movie is: If you are suffering from mental illness and have lapsed in taking your medicine, the best way to save your family from the horror you're bringing upon them is to shoot yourself in the head. ", "A group of friends was sitting in the front section of our theater. During one of the quiet moments, one of them scared another and freaked out the whole group. The rest of the theater had a good laugh about it.\n\nAs far as the movie itself went, it was pretty good. Not incredibly scary (the bit where Diana moved to the top of the couch at the end of the 'movie night' was probably the best one for me), but there were some really clever uses of the \"can't be in light\" gimmick. My favorite one was definitely the gunshots - it didn't even occur to me that the muzzle flash would render them useless.\n\nThe characters were well fleshed out, too! I enjoyed each one of them, and surprisingly didn't want them to die. That's a win in my book.", "Just saw it anyone else find this movie scary as fuck?", "This movie is a 6/10, but it's got aspects of a 10/10 movie.\n\nI say it's a 6/10 because the dialogue/character exposition/plot as a whole are somewhat average. There was never a time where I felt impressed by a line, there wasn't really anything profound in the character's backgrounds or development, and the plot dealt with a hot button issue and really kind of ignored it as the conflict progressed until it became easy to call back to as a resolution to the plot. \n\nThat said, this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life. Maybe because I went to an 11:40pm showing, maybe I'm just a bigger wimp than I thought I was, but me and my girlfriend (who've been on a horror tear recently) left the theater absolutely disturbed. This movie had the goal of terrifying it's audience, it set out to accomplish that goal and it absolutely did. The premise itself was terrifying, the unrelenting and seemingly impossible to overcome villain was terrifying, and the situations the characters were put in were terrifying.\n\n-the scene with the blacklight was creative and frightening\n-the words on the ground/notebook \n-the boyfriend being chased and evading through clever maneuvers was brilliant \n-the fact that this creature was intelligent and you knew she was going to do the smart thing in every scene was refreshingly dreadful as a viewer \n\nI truly felt each scare scene was well earned and well directed. I found myself in fear at every turn, and I was wishing for any kind of relief from the conflict as it went on. The movie should've been 30 minutes longer in order to have a more tense resolution, but as a whole, I found myself praying and thanking God it was over in the end. \n\nIf you're a fan of horror, see this movie.\n\nIf you're a fan of all film and want to pay to see a well rounded, complete film? Stream it for free elsewhere honestly. \n\nThe film has its flaws, but credit goes to the fear it brought me. Well earned.

Definitely saw the symbolism with Diana representing the mother's depression, but I think it could've been handled a lot better...\n\nI think it was too simple of an \"external\" conflict, where Diana was just an evil ghost influencing the mother. I was almost expecting a twist where instead of the hospital records revealing Diana was a real person and the victim of some experiment, she was an imaginary friend or alternate personality invented by Sophie. It would have been more interesting if Diana was Sophie's way of subconsciously lashing out at her family (she was mad at them for \"abandoning\" her, etc.)\n\nThere was a conversation where Sophie insisted \"ghosts aren't real\" so I was almost thinking Diana would turn out to be something else - not a dead person.\n\nI also thought that defeating Diana by committing suicide was a bit of an uncomfortable solution. Kind of like it's suggesting the only way to protect your loved ones from your depression is by killing yourself.\n\nI almost wonder if there were rewrites in order to simplify the story for a general audience, because it definitely seemed like there was some ignored potential here. Overall, though, still a good movie, with some creative scares and an above-average plot and characters.", "the ghost reminds me a lot of the one in mama. am i wrong?", "I'm done taking advice from Rotten Tomatoes. ", "Am I honestly the only person that hated this? The only positive thing I can say about it is that the boyfriend was a good character. Everything else about the movie was a 3/10.", "I liked this movie but I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the mental illness aspect. So tired of movies belittling it. The Babadook handled it pretty well, where as in this film it was used to make things spookier. The acting was alright, as well. And oh god, the attempt to make Becca look edgy, with the Avenged Sevenfold poster on the wall, haha. \n\nOverall this movie isn't on par with recent horror films like The Conjuring 2, but I was really surprised. It could've easy been one of the many horror movies that come in and out of theaters. ", "The jump scares seemed pretty predictable to me. Any time a character is doing that typical \"slow walk trying not to make noise, whispering someone's name\" shit? That's a sign that they're walking the wrong direction, and no one in real life would do that shit. I never really jumped at this movie, even though the conjuring 1 and 2 scared the shit out of me.\n\nThe intro scene with the husband really got my hopes up; I was like, ok this dude did everything right. I can't blame him, I probably would've done the same shit. I love horror movies where the characters are reasonable and rational and do everything right. It was honestly probably my favorite scene and could've been a short all it's own. \n\nI did like the subversion in the little boys first scene when he went to find \"mom\" and it turned out it actually was mom.\n\n The boyfriend was also a real one. True Blue hero. I fucking loved his cell phone and car ingenuity. \n\nThe mom never really seemed crazy, just a member of an abusive relationship with a ghosty demon thing. So her actions just seemed ridiculous to me, but we'll write that off with a \"well she's crazy\" even though her only mental illness was depression, not schizophrenia. It was all Diana's fault, probs. \n\nRebecca did some stupid shit. Repeatedly. Over and over. You don't wander into dark corridors or rooms or closets. You don't open doors when someone knocks when you're haunted. You don't abandon a small child asleep when there's literally demons afoot. You don't go into a basement in a haunted house. You don't ever stop winding up your God damn lantern. On that note, you don't fucking go into a haunted house owned by a light-weakness ghost without hella flashlights on deck. I'd probably have a spelunking helmet with a batman belt filled with flashlights and a reflective vest, at that point. \n\nI felt like they were gearing for a sequel when Diana starts talking to Rebecca upstairs in the house, because if she was talking to her maybe she got in Rebecca's head. I saw no other clues to that, though so maybe this was a one off.\n\nRIP cops 1 and 2, your names were forgotten but your bravery never will be. \n\nOverall i rated the film at 7/10. I liked it, it did some things really well, some cliches but it did make up for most of them. My standards are likely pretty high coming off all the great films out recently though, so i probably won't watch it again for a good while if ever, and would only recommend to hardcore horror fans. ", "Thought it was good. A 7/10 is probably what I would give it.\n\nIt was good, the really disappointing thing was that the trailers gave away almost every scare. Still, it got me a few times and the premise is still something that will stick with me.\n\nIt would've been pretty cool if the girl looked something like the short instead of generic movie demon. \n\nI did feel like I cared more about the characters in this horror than a lot of them, and that kept me invested and empathizing with them. The boyfriend scene was very good and had me almost cheering in my seat.\n\nI liked the bleak ending but it was the most weird part of the movie for me. How are they gonna explain that to the police?\n\nOverall it was a good fun time, may see it again with friends but solid movie and good debut for /u/dauid. I feel like he's got a lot of potential.", "Great feature-length directorial debut /u/dauid!\n\nThe only issue I really I had with the movie is that I wish I never saw Diana out of the shadows.  I enjoyed her being left to the imagination, and loved the look of her silhouette.  Actually seeing her lessened the movie a bit.\n\nBeyond that though, loved it!", "The movie was not very good. I thought they were going for a \"use light to drive away the darkness of mental illness\" kind of thing until Mom blew her brains out. Best to stick with the short film I think.", "Such a well constructed horror. Definitely room for some improvement but some of the scenes were filled with such dread and tension. Definitely comparable to The Babadook and will certainly be one of the most talked about horrors of 2016.\n\nBravo, /u/dauid", "Pretty good and worth the money, that about sums it up for me. \n\nI enjoyed the characters and their story and appreciated that they used logic and reason instead of just being typical archetype victims. I also really loved that they found a way to keep the lights on/lights off gimmick fresh and surprising throughout the film (some seriously creative moments made their way in to this film that had me chuckling. Not because they were funny, but because they were clever and surprising). And I liked how, despite knowing what was coming for the most part, they still had me jumping throughout the movie. Overall, the film's underlying theme of mental illness and standing by family really made it stand out as more than a jump scare ghost story, and as I mentioned earlier, despite knowing what any shadow/dark room could mean for the characters, the director still had some excellent scenes of great tension that made me white knuckle the armrest of my seat. \n\nSo overall, it was a 7/10 for me. Worth the money and I'd recommend to anyone looking for a fun time at the movies. As a sidenote, the first time Diana (the ghost) came on screen, my theater laughed. My friend and I rolled our eyes at our fellow audience members and prepared for a subpar moviegoing experience. However, the second time she was on screen, the laughs turned to screams and stayed that way, and that's as good a selling point for this movie as I can give.", "I see that many people liked the movie on this sub but actually, I found the movie poor at so many levels:\n\n-I really disliked the kid's acting! It felt like I was seeing Anakin from the phantom menace\nall over again.\n\n-So many cheesy/cringie lines.\n\n-Some decisions that plotwise make absolutely nonsense like when Rebecca wakes middle of the night and leaves the kid alone with a freaking candle. Are you serious? The boy was dragged from under the bed before when there was a lot more light. How does this make sense? There is a malefic spirit living with Ma. What we should do? Spend the night over. (Just to point a few)\n\n-The characters felt blend to me. Becca was the only one I was interested in. The others not so much.\n\n-The whole backstory of Diana explanation through the photos and the recorder seemed so rushed. I know that the boy's father had been collecting evidences and putting stuff together about Diana, but still. In five minutes, Becca knows everything about the mother's past and Diana just like that. \n\nThere were pretty good jump scares here and there and some good sequences like the boyfriend being chased, but besides it...\n\nI've seen the movie yesterday night and got a bit disappointed. I went with high expectations and, in the end, the movie felt short to me.", "God, I was so bored during this movie. The first 40-50 minutes of this movie just wander around between hurriedly trying to explain Diane (which it doesn't need to do and takes away all the fun of the premise) and hurtling towards its excuse to have all the characters end up in the house in the finale.\n\nIt then wakes up for the finale, which I'll admit was fun, but only in the sense that things were actually moving and it took its premise back to its basics. But every time it would have a character do something smart and logical it takes two steps backwards by having them do something just because the script and director told them to do it that way.\n\nWhich is really all the movie is: A bunch of people doing things because the script and director tells them to do so. And it's a shame because even if you ignore how well this premise could work if it cut off the fat, there is some genuinely interesting stuff to pull out with the mother's mental illness (poor Maria Bello, a great actress trying her hardest to give this movie something legitimate). But the mental illness just becomes this lame plot device for Diane to even exist, which never even makes narrative sense to begin with. And then they have it end with such a lame conclusion by having Maria Bello kill herself because fuck actually doing something that requires the story team to do any actual work. She just kills herself and bam. Movie's over. Forget the fact that two cops just died which is gonna leave a lot of questions and forget the fact that the social worker has already said that the young boy is due to be screwed over by the judicial system. Diane is conveniently gone. No need to worry about anything anymore. Let's just do the cliche crane shot of the characters sitting in the ambulance looking over the scene where chaos just happened.

Probably more than Star Trek '09. When the characters get into situations, they don't always just fight their way out. They think their way out, they tech their way out. And it's more faithful to classic Trek tech. There's no transporting from Earth directly to Qo'Nos, or flying there in a couple of hours. There's no deus ex tribble that magically saves the day and ruins any sense of tension or pathos at the end.\n\nThe action is fun. It has a certain... glibness to it, where it doesn't quite take itself too seriously, but is still pretty cool, which is something Justin Lin does well in the Fast and the Furious movies.

In this case, it's hawkish people who believe we need conflict and war to reach our full potential, which is something many people will argue as true... but does run counter to the ideals that make up Star Trek. \n\nSo, I loved it, and would personally recommend it, both to fans of Trek and otherwise.\n\nOf course, my friend wasn't quite so pleased. He felt the movie was poorly paced, didn't like the villain, and felt the movie lacked pathos. So I guess I can't say that it's for everyone!", "A few more thoughts on the film.\n\n* The cast has really come into their own. Pine in particular *is* Kirk and cannot get enough credit for what he has done with what should have been a thankless role.\n\n* The effects are gorgeous. I don't think we've ever seen something like the Yorktown put on film before.\n\n* Michael Giacchino's score is easily the most Trek-like score from the reboots. There are parts that closely echo Jerry Goldsmith's score for The Motion Picture.\n\n* I had few issues with Krall. Not sure how I feel about the late reveal but his motivations weren't as muddled as they seemed to others.\n\n* I *loved* all the throwbacks to Enterprise. That series does not get enough love.\n\n* Sulu is a consummate badass in the movie. Has some great moments -- just wish he and Uhura had more to do in the second act.\n\n* \"Kelvin pods\"? That was an interesting touch.\n\n* One final thing: the picture of the Prime Universe crew was a very strange meta moment, the likes of which we don't see in movies. It could have so easily come off wrong but somehow it just worked. It connected with my audience.''\n\n* Sulu's husband was such a non-moment. I honestly wouldn't know what to make of it if it hadn't leaked before -- might have thought he was his brother...?\n\n* Justin Lin needs to come back for another. He lets his camera float over the proceedings and it gives us some gorgeous tableaus.\n\nA very solid Star Trek movie. It's a better movie than Star Trek 2009, but lacks the novelty. The best of the series since First Contact.", "I like the beats and shouting.

", "I feel like of all the Star Trek films recently, this one would be the one that Gene Roddenberry would be the most proud of. Maybe its just me, but this one was so optimistic about humanity's future. That's what I felt made the original series so great, and what's been lost the past few films. Finally the crew is exploring and discovering new things. Also humans and order species have created a city in space designed for exploration, all working together. Roddenberry believed that humans would be capable of great things if we worked together.\n\nThe movie itself was so much fun, and it felt like everyone got a fair share of screen time. Spock and Bones were great together, Kirk and Chekhov were fun, Scotty was funny, and Uhura and Sulu were awesome. Jaylah will be a awesome character if she stays, and I'm so glad they didn't make her and Kirk get together. I'm also happy they took the crew of the enterprise and we got to see a brand new world.\n\nIts not a perfect movie. The villain was okay (better than Nero or admiral Marcus), but I understood his motivation, and it made sense. \n\nThere were some things that I must have missed or they didn't make sense. Who was the other bad guy who killed Jaylah's family? He had one fight scene and was never heard from again.\n\nWhere was Carol Marcus? She was set up as a big character in the last movie, but is no where to be seen here.\n\nDid the station not have a security force of their own? They were absent in the climax.\n\nWhy did Krall look different?\n\nOverall, this is probably my favorite trek movie since First Contact, and I very much look forward to where the series goes from here.\n\n8/10\n\n", "I loved it. It was just about as good as it could have been without being \"fucking amazing\". Kirk was finally written as a maturing man and was less *cartoonishly* reckless and arrogant. He was never really lost control of himself and did some smart things like outwit Krall's mole. They FINALLY avoided the \"Movie Spock Problem\". The Movie Spock problem is that Spock's whole thing is that he is logical to a fault in all things, yet has a level of human emotions buried deep inside him that can come out in extreme circumstances. Now, on a TV show, you can keep him calm and logical for 9 eps in a row, and make good use of an emotional outburst on the 10s and maintain Spock's nature as it should be. In a film, however, you necessarily need a few big dramatic climaxes over a couple hours and writers fall into the trap of tying these climaxes into huge emotional meltdowns by Spock. The effect is that, in films, Spock looks like more of an unstable lunatic who can sometimes pretend to be rational and logical. I mean shit, Into Darkness had him literally crying while punching a guy over and over and over again and screaming. Just before that he cried also. The first film had this problem too. Finally, Beyond did it correctly and gave Spock his \"emotional\" moments that were actually touching bubbles of emotion reacting to circumstances rather than tear drenched, screaming meltdowns. Also, pairing Spock with McCoy for the 2nd act, rather than Uhura, was very wise and benefited both characters. I appreciated the Uhura Spock relationship being wittled down to about  2 min worth of screen time as well. Chekov and Scotty were great as always. Only Sulu had nothing good to do, but he was featured heavily in the previous two films. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy fears from the trailer and general buzz were alleviated. The motorcycle scene actually made some sense and was more than \"Kirk looking awesome and making sweet jumps!\". The bike served a sensible purpose and felt more Star Treky do to the wise inclusion of Jayla's cool Loki/copy tech and hardening goo stuff. Jayla herself I was also worried about, but she was fine. Had less screen time than I feared and was juuuust interesting enough to not be irritating. She mostly served to explain shit to the crew, which was fine. Maybe the writers could have done something better than \"father died\" with her story, but the story didn't matter either way. I didn't mind the Enterprise destruction scene because of how well it was done. Lin really captured the sense of dread at the growing awareness of helplessness and that the crew was being systematically and irreversibly defeated WHILE everyone kept there calm and did their best despite knowing it was ineffectual. I could feel the empty feeling as Kirk jettisoned out. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nLoved the focus on Kirk's character and mental state during the opening. Made him feel less like the boy captain of the previous two films and added a lot of nuance to his character and performance throughout the rest of the film. The final confrontation was another punch out but at least it was more visually creative to look at and had more going on.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI FUCKING LOVED the sets on Krall's planet. Like holy shit. Krall's base camp somehow managed to be the *perfect* blend of campy 60s TOS design and new Trek design. The weird colorful structures and buildings, the jagged rock landscape. It looked like, visually, the perfect update of TOS design into a 2016 film. Also loved the warp effects, amazing sound design in general, and the entire Yorktown location. Yorktown was so much better than Earth. I loved the design. Why the fuck did they use Earth in Into Darkness?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nKrall was a decent villain. At a certain point, towards the end, I thought, \"so.... is that it with Krall then? Just some alien weirdo with a boner for violence we never really learned anything about?\" and literally 30 seconds later, the film started revealing more about him to answer my mental pre-complaints. Not an amazing villain, but quite good. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAnd finally, I thought the fan service/real world acknowledging moments were handled appropriately and tastefully. Had some real emotion and never felt like too much audience winking. Made sense within the logic of the franchise universe. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI do wish they had used a different song than \"Sabotage\" again though. Literally anything that wasn't already associated with Star Trek. Only (inappropriate) audience wink I perceived in the film and I hate audience winks.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo yeah. Loved it. Out of all the improvements I noticed, the most important, by far, is the better writing for Kirk and Spock. I honestly would have tolerated a much worse film than Beyond if it at least maintained Beyond's writing for the two. Roeper was correct when saying in his review \"it plays like an extended version of one of the better episodes of The Original Series.\"\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAll in all a worthy ST trilogy. Excellent first film for the crew's introduction, thrilling and emotionally intense, but problematic/flawed second film, and a great third film with the best character writing. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNow, all we need is a fourth film whose plot deals with some kind of truly mind-bending/expanding, creative, bizarre space anomaly/entity/god type thing that can't be just out punched in the end and requires something really heady/trippy to deal with and plenty of unsettling implications and ethical paradoxes to encounter. That type of the story is the most notable absence in this reboot and I would love a feature like that done with the quality of Beyond. \n", "I got teary-eyed when the old crew photo appeared \u0ca5\ufe4f\u0ca5", "[deleted]", "I thought it was great. Exactly what I wanted from these new films. Find the middle ground between an action oriented Trek film and make it feel like an extended episode of the original series. The tribute to Nimoy and the old crew was also absolutely perfect. I think to film's main weakness was not developing Krall a bit more. His true identity made for a legitimate surprise at the end, but at the expense of not really being all that interested in him as a character for 90% of the film. Otherwise, really great stuff. Pegg and Lin did a fine job.", "This the Star Trek movie I've wanted since the first mention of a big screen production way back when. No, it isn't perfect but it is the best combination of what worked best in TOS and the need for a modern action movie style for it we've seen yet.\n\nIt was a fun movie that gave me the feels needed for my many, many years of watching TOS. Simon Pegg needs to keep writing them and possibly even direct one. It would have been a lot better if a couple of the mondo action scenes in the middle would have been toned down to something a bit more quieter and leaning on the dramatic aspects.\n\nI know people will hate on it but I had a blast with the Sabotage scene. I think I was the only one in the theater who laughed when it cued up, I guess most don't remember it from the fist one?\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing it again and it definitely gets the franchise back on track after that Into Darkness debacle.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Just out of this.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Plenty of pros, plenty of cons. However, I am excited for the new alien girl who is now a part of their crew.

Giant green hand.\n\nAlso of note was \"skip to the end\", which I took as a great little reference to Spaced.", "Wife and I loved it. My only wish was that they spent a bit more on backstory for the technology they found on the planet, and the villain motivation seemed a tad under developed and weak. Great tributes overall and well done though ", "The gratuitous amount of star fleet deaths and the usually horrific ways they killed them really didn't fit the tone of this movie. Half the time the bridge crew was joking around with each other, the other half some poor redshirt gets shot/\"eaten\"/disintegrated/jettisoned into space. And almost always painfully with alot of screaming. After the two no names got \"eaten\" by krell in front of Uhara and Sulu, screaming bloody murder through gags, I spent a good 10 minutes getting over it. Seriously, you don't torture two innocent people to death in an otherwise lighthearted action movie and expect people to laugh at the next joke two minutes later.\n\nPlus it got really annoying how the bridge crew seemed to know they wouldnt die. They watch dozens of the crew get killed then just casually talk to each other while running away. Spock and Kirk are talking about what they are going to do after they get back home. I would have appreciated a \"if we get back\". The amount of stormtrooper firing when shooting at the bridge crew was ridiculous compared to how the rest of the crew got casually slaughtered.\n\nAlso did they ever explain who the rest of Krells minions were. He said in his log there were only 3 of his crew left, and there were at least 2 more grunts working for him. Where did everyone else come from?\n\nSo yeah. Everything up until the last 20 minutes was a mixed bag of depressingly horrifying and funny. Honestly only the last 20 minutes felt 100% good (especially the surfing scene).", "Whether you like this film or not you gotta give it up to the design team.

I never thought I'd hear a reference to anything Enterprise related again. But alas, here we are. A good amount of respect paid to everything in the Star Trek universe. Not in the, \"LOOK A TRIBBLE\" way, but more in the, \"That was extremely respectful, flowed with the plot, and made sense to be there\", way.\n\nAlso, it's not on Earth. It's on the Yorktown station on the Frontier. THAT'S awesome. I'm so glad it wasn't Earth under attack again. It's Star Trek getting back to Star Trek. They're out in space. They're doing things! Sure, the threat isn't the end of everything, the stakes being smaller made them that much greater. Our crew was being attacked. They had a great chance of dying as we saw our favorite ship fall apart. Our characters were fine in the end, sure, but with the actual destruction of the Enterprise, it made the stakes that much greater. \n\n\nThere were a few parts that I didn't really like. Such as Sabotage. I would have liked it a lot more if the trailer didn't show it. If the trailer stuck with some other song like Big Booty Bitches or something, it would have kept the surprise intact. But, alas, we all expected it. \n\nBut overall, a really good movie.

A lot of touching moments and great character dynamics.\n\nLiked how when Enterprise was attacked, crew didnt actually spend their time to talk one-liners or quips copnstantly (like Spok and Uhura argued in STID, i hate that stuff), it was just team of proffessionals who spoke only when needed and calmly and mostly silently did their job.

Why waste time and resources hunting for a bioweapon which is difficult to deploy when you already have such a powerful force at your disposal?\n\nHis swarm WRECKED the enterprise, the most advanced starfleet ship.

The only issue I had was with Krall. Don't get me wrong, Idris Elba's great and the character is occasionally intriguing, but overall, he just felt like an afterthought. However, everything else is great. Justin Lin's direction is very much similar to that of J.J. Abrams' work on the other two films but Lin still gives it his own unique touch. Simon Pegg & Doug Jung's script is very well-written, offering compelling and well-developed characters, an engaging story, and many humorous moments to help balance out the darker portions of the film. The cast is on top form, especially Chris Pine as Kirk, and Sofia Boutella makes for a wonderful addition as Jaylah. The effects are as amazing as ever, as is Michael Giacchino's score. In a lot of ways, this film is very reminiscent of the Original Series, while still also being true to the other ST films in the Kelvin timeline.

In fact the whole thing felt like a Star Trek episode in a big movies shoes which in my eyes worked really well. Over all it was just a whole lot of fun and very colourful. The characters really shone through the admittedly straight-forward plot, even the villain got very interesting for me in the third act of the film.\nPersonally I'd rate this higher than the first Star Trek (2009) film just because of the sheer amount of fun I had watching this thing.", "This movie was awesome. Great fun, lots of good action, great jokes. Very well balanced, great Star Trek movie. I liked it more than Into Darkness, not sure whether I liked it more than Star Trek(2009), they are very close for me. \n\nIt was a very refreshing movie for the summer as well. The summer season has been full of lackluster,bad, disappointing movies, to the point that a movie coming out that I loved is a rare occurrence. I thought Justin Lin handled it very well.

I was hoping he'd get to do something cool in this movie, especially considering recent events, and it was like they somehow knew what to do beforehand.\n\nWeirdly I'm actually not all that fond of the Enterprise-A design. My problem with it is the same one I had with the previous Kelvin-timeline design: the nacelles. All the previous designs of all classes had nacelles mounted a little farther forward on their pylons, but both of the reboot designs have had them so far back that only the forward \"nubs\" are in front of the pylons. That probably makes no sense and it's absolutely a nitpick, but it makes them look really flimsy to me.\n\nAlso, did anybody happen to catch if Sulu's family was in the credits?

There is this sense of wonder and adventure that comes with the movie that really excites me. The cinematography was beautiful. The planet that they happened to crash on was un earth like, but yet so realistic, and simply beautiful. The acting was decent too. Cant remember a time where i was irritated by unrealistic acting. The only problem i had was the dialogues. They seemed obviously set up for eventual punchlines or one liners. But minor issue. Ultimately i had an enjoyable time.

I am in the minority in that I LOVED ST09. In fact, it's my favorite Trek movie ever. Hell, it's one of my favorite movies ever, period. So naturally, like many, I was left wanting from Into Darkness. The first half of ID was terrific. The Klingon stuff, the espionage/section 31 callback, all of that was great. But then Khan became a thing, and ruined it all.  \n\nSo naturally going into this one, I was skeptical. Never really cared for the Fast and the Furious films, and I know the pre-production of the movie went through some turmoil. And to top it off, the trailers were, well...yah.  \n\nSo I gotta say, so incredibly surprised by how enjoyable the film was. It was just so much fun. So uplifting and positive. Not the usual dark and brooding summer blockbuster that I have become accustomed to seeing lately. It's just a plain good ol' fun time at the movies. And like many have said, it felt like an extended episode of the original series, in the best way possible.  \n\nThe one scene that hit me particularly hard - when young Spock found out about old Spock's death. I really felt that I was seeing the actor react to Nimoy's death, even more than a character portrayal. It was very meta, and handled beautifully. The picture of the original crew at the end - also very powerful. I really liked that they added that in. Also, Enterprise references! The Xindi! The Earth Romulan war we never got to see! All very very cool. You can tell Pegg is a massive trekkie for throwing in something like that.  \n\nSo where does it go from here? Hopefully no time travel. I am completely done with time travel in sci-fi. However, if Kirk's dad is indeed in the next one...*groan*. Hopefully we finally get that Klingon Federation war that Into Darkness hinted at.

People's big complaint always seemed to be that they turned Trek into a generic dumb action movie, and although I don't really agree with that, I really do not understand what this movie did differently. If anything I felt this film was LESS philosophical and intriguing than the previous ones. It also still had the \"stupid\" that Into Darkness had. The hologram weapon is cool, but makes no sense to me, since so many of those holograms CLEARLY make contact, and act independently. The villain's plan to get the weapon is fine, but how did he even know the Enterprise had it. He was banking on Kirk being the one to go on the mission, despite his logs showing how he was thinking of quitting. If they're so far on the frontier, what is the huge base doing so close to the uncharted nebula. The ship working after hundreds of years. The ship being cloaked despite it literally BEING Krull's old ship. Come to think of it, where did he even get the technology and army he has? Then there's the Beastie Boys (which I loved, but I bet it'll be divisive). \n\nThese are nit picks, I really had a fun time with the movie, especially the back half, but I don't understand why this movie is the ones fans were apparently waiting for when I can find the same criticisms levied at the last two.

The camp that his base was at didn't look that large either, but he had to have at least a million ships with him. And why did he need the bio-weapon if his swarm army was so powerful? They looked like they could overtake the base without the bioweapon. Why are mining ships more powerful that military ships?

Far better imo than either of the previous two.  Better than many of the older movies too.  Characters are starting to come into their own more.

Read on:\n\n* We know he\u2019s evil because he LOOKS evil.  It\u2019s not enough that he just launched an unprovoked attack on the enterprise.  The bad guy has to have demon eyes and rotten teeth, and generally be a monster.\n  \n   **Let\u2019s really think about how insulting this is to the audience here:**  They thought that the context of destroying the enterprise and indiscriminately killing hundreds of his own people while he\u2019s at it wasn\u2019t enough to let us know that the bad guy is a bad guy.  He literally had to be made up to look like a monster.\n\n* Scotty gets mugged by the only three people on the surface of the planet.  Wait, wait, there is ONE more person on the surface.

Yeah, an actual vampire.**   \u201cWait!\u201d you say, \u201cI saw the movie.  He was NOT an actual vampire\u201d.  Yes he was, stranger.

If you don\u2019t know what a penny-farthing is, do a google image search, and imagine Captain Kirk peddling around on one.\n\n   This would be stupid enough on its own, but we\u2019ve already established (for no apparent reason) that everyone on this planet lives underground.  But it\u2019s okay, you can disregard that, because again for no apparent reason, they\u2019ve moved a bunch of prisoners to the surface to sit in a cage.\n\n* So they escape, and Scotty\u2019s friend, the ninja girl, almost gets revenge on the dude who killed her father.  Not because she went looking for him, but because by a lucky coincidence on this entire planet, he just happened to be the guy guarding these prisoners.\n* A bonus dash of stupid:  Even though our heroes crashed randomly on the planet without any guidance whatsoever, they all ended up just a few hours walk from each other and from the remains of the Enterprise.  Just super lucky I guess!\n* Scotty\u2019s girlfriend and the fact that she lives in a ship that she has hidden with cloaking technology.  What\u2019s stupid about that?  The guy she\u2019s hiding the ship from\u2026 IS THE GUY WHO CRASHED THE SHIP IN THAT EXACT SPOT.  Yeah.  Really.   Dude crashes a starship, then she comes along decades later and throws a cloaking device over it, and poof, he doesn\u2019t know where it is anymore? \n\n* So Scotty and the gang fix this ancient and crashed ship using nothing but what they find on board, and even though this thing has been rotting away over the decades they get it working better than its original crew did.  Oh, and they do this in an afternoon.\n\n* The ship is an old star ship, which they go out of the way to explain isn\u2019t designed for in-atmosphere flight.   But then 3 minutes later Chekov is talking about the velocity needed to create sufficient lift to fly the thing\u2026 this thing that is not at all designed for aerodynamics.  It would be like talking about the lift needed to fly a skyscraper.  If it\u2019s not designed to create lift, it doesn\u2019t matter how fast it\u2019s going.  Stupid.\n\n* We found out earlier that The Artifact is a superweapon.  Krull is going to attack the big starbase nearby with it, because\u2026 reasons.  No, really.  He babbles about unity, and stopping the expanding boundary of the Federation, and about conflict making people strong\u2026 but there\u2019s never anything approaching a coherent motive behind his plan.  He\u2019s just an evil guy.  We know he\u2019s evil, remember because he looks evil.  And he\u2019s a vampire.\n* Since we\u2019re already well Beyond Stupid, they don\u2019t even try to explain why Krull lets Jim and his ancient spaceship fly past his overwhelmingly superior armada of ships while they make their attack run.  This is a guy who just a couple days ago made sure that not even a single escape pod got away from him.\n\n* Krull\u2019s ships are absolutely mutilating the Federation starbase.  I mean, they\u2019re just ripping this thing apart.  Krull, meanwhile tries desperately to get his superweapon to the central heart of the station, where it will kill everybody.\n\n  Think about this for a moment:\n\n   Krull has been waiting for decades? Centuries? On this nearby planet with his massive armada of invincible war ships, and he\u2019s only been holding out for this \u201csuperweapon\u201d which really has about the same effect as any nasty chemical weapon.  I mean, it moves and spreads slowly like a gas, and it kills people.  BIG DEAL.  The \u201csuperweapon\u201d is NOTHING compared to Krull\u2019s army of drone ships.\n\n* Beyond Stupid doesn\u2019t even begin to describe mindlessness of what happens next:  Spock discovers that the swarm of warships must communicate with one another somehow.  *GASP* And so their big plan is to disrupt the communications by \u201cbroadcasting on a frequency they wouldn\u2019t expect\u201d.  So they\u2026 I wish I was kidding\u2026 decide to blast The Beastie Boy\u2019s \u201cSabotage\u201d over the radio.  I need to break down this idiocy into subsections:\n* * \tTODAY in 2016, we KNOW how swarm behavior works.  In birds and in fish swarm behaviors are NOT controlled by communication.  They\u2019re controlled by each independent animal responding to the increased or decreased proximity of the other animals around it.\n* * \tIf you\u2019re going to disrupt communications, you can\u2019t just do it on \u201ca frequency they wouldn\u2019t expect\u201d you have to do it on the frequency THEY ARE USING TO COMMUNICATE.  Jim\u2019s plan is like trying to break up a heated family argument by blowing a dog whistle.   Dude, no one can hear you.\n* * \tThese drone ships have fewer safety features than my Subaru I guess, because the second they lose the ability to communicate, the start crashing into each other and exploding.  \n* * \tThat\u2019s it for my specific criticisms of this scene, but **I feel we should all have a moment of silence to appreciate this all-time low in the Star Trek franchise.**  \u201cLet\u2019s have Kirk kill all the bad guys by playing Beastie Boys really loud at them\u201d is an idea that should have be laughed out of the room immediately.  This is an idea so monumentally inappropriate and brainless that it makes the Kirk-on-motorcycle stunt look brilliant and inspired.\n\n* The stupidity isn\u2019t over.  You see, Krull, or whatever his name really was\u2026 it turns out that he isn\u2019t an alien space monster.  It turns out\u2026 he\u2019s a human.  He was the captain of the old federation ship that crashed.  Just as we\u2019re figuring this out from old video tapes that the crew made on their VHS camcorders, Krull drinks some dude\u2019s blood, and for the first time in the entire movie starts to look like a human.   Because reasons.\n\n    Let\u2019s talk about this for a moment, because it\u2019s important.  Krull\u2019s wishy-washy motives for killing the federation now make absolutely no sense whatsoever.  He \u2026 went insane because he got sucked through a wormhole and got stranded\u2026 but then he somehow was able to tap into federation communications, and never sent an S.O.S\u2026. but he\u2019s mad because the Federation doesn\u2019t care about him? \n   \n   Also, he somehow managed to take over an entire planet, despite the fact that his technology was pathetically inferior to the people he conquered?\n\n   Also, he spent the entire movie being evasive about the fact that he was human?  Other than to give themselves a big third act reveal, this served no logical purpose whatsoever. \n\n* Jim and Spock save the day.  They decide not to quit Starfleet.  The Admiral offers Jim the rear(or vice?) admiral position based on the fact that Jim just saved the station\u2026 NEVERMIND THAT HE SAVED ALL OF PLANET EARTH A COUPLE YEARS AGO.  Jim then rudely rejects the promotion, which doubly rude since he requested it in the first place.\n\n* Spock has received a box full of Old Spock\u2019s stuff.  In it is a photograph of the original Star Trek crew (likely a publicity photo they did during Undiscovered Country).  It is a jarring moment where we, the audience, who are generally happy with the recasting, are forced to admit that the old crew looked almost nothing like the new.   In its way it is a well-intentioned tribute to Nimoy and the rest of the old guard, but given the unforgivable crapfest that was \u201cStar Trek Beyond\u201d, it felt almost insulting.\n", "Loved the movie, definitely my favorite I've seen in a while.

When the crew uses the USS Franklin to destory the swarm with that music, I agree it was funny, but also cringeworthy. And it took only 2 minutes to defeat the enemy like this.

", "MAKE HUMANITY GREAT AGAIN -Krall", "Saw this yesterday. Kind of baffled by the overwhelming positive response on here, especially coming from people who say they didn't like Into Darkness. Here's what I think is going on: This movie was able to successfully please fans of big & dumb action popcorn movies AND treat the characters and canon of Star Trek in a respectful way. The first two new Star Trek movies definitely weren't as successful at doing both of these things.\n\nFrom my perspective as someone who has seen some of the original series and some of The Next Generation (as well as the other 2 new Trek films), there was almost nothing positive about this movie after they arrived at the new space station. The plot/story was tripping over itself constantly, the action scenes were a shaky mess, the rules of the super bioweapon were really hazy (why didn't it attack Kirk at the end as he floated right by it?). This is a very weak film even if the Beastie Boys & motorcycle scenes were excluded.\n\nEven the message failed. The villain talks about individuality over unity (even though the unity of his drone swarm was his main strength), and then is foiled in a totally contrived fist fight by Kirk largely acting alone while his united crew watches.\n\nIf you don't like Fast & Furious style movies, and don't know what the USS Franklin is before entering the theater you are probably not going to get much enjoyment out of this. I predict opinion will turn negative on this as time goes on, similar to Into Darkness.", "Well this series is over.

I'm sure we mentioned that for no reason\"", "I...didn't like the movie.\n\nIn the third act after the crew destroyed the bee armada, I was suddenly pulled out of the movie by realizing that the only thing left was for the villain's past to be revealed (which I realized when he said \"old friend\" towards his ship) and then a fight over the big weapon thing.\n\nI had the sudden impression that the movie was really short and that it didn't really satisfy, but when I thought about it I realized the movie had to be 2 hours long or so.\n\nMy conclusion on why I felt this way and why the movie felt so incomplete is because the movie doesn't really pay off what it sets up.\n\nThe movie starts off with the theme that the ongoing mission into space was long and had worn down the crew. Kirk wanted to leave, Spock wanted to repopulate his planet, and the villain's speeches are all about individual struggle over unity.\n\nBut it doesn't feel like the actions of the movie explored those ideas at all or really proved the villain wrong. Yeah, the crew worked together, but the crew always works together. Nothing they did really seemed to actualize the themes at all. On top of that, the villain and his weapon are essentially ignored until the last few minutes of the movie when the villian's intentions are explained by a very short video monologue.\n\nIt felt like I was read a quick summary of character motivations rather than actually saw a movie that *shows* you the characters' motivations. \n\nUltimately the action is fine, but it seems like they rushed thru the actual plot and details so they could make sure there were these extended action sequences.", "*My name is ZebraChick. Manos, you killed my father, prepare to totally not die because I can't really fight that well.*\n\nThis felt like a monster of the week episode more than something worthy of a full length movie. Especially with the \"and nothing changed at all\" outcome.\n\nI appreciate the swarm attack scenes and the attempt at good SFX, but the sum total is that nothing made sense. An old Federation ship crashes into the planet (Why did they go there?), the captain finds the old mining operation and the drone fleet (But does nothing with it while being able to escape the nebula?), watches all his crew die at his hands and survives by harvesting the scraps of other ships crashing into the planet (Again, why did **those** ships go there?), learns about the ancient superweapon (How?) and decides to use that to ruin the Federation's peace (Because... No, seriously... I could, even, but then again, should I?..). All of this is so open to interpretation it's pretty much water with no solids in it. \n\nAgain, not being a die hard Star Trek fan, I have no idea if any of the species shown are new to the universe or pre-established. Is the betrayer gurrrrrrrrrrl of a previously contacted species so her claims of a science vessel going down are easily believed? Is the ZebraChick of a known species so she gets admitted to the starfleet academy just like that? Is Krall's entire menagerie a species known to the feds (I assume that no)?\n\nIn the end I feel that Star Trek's \"The space is endless, so literally anything and anyone can happen\" leaves too much leeway for pulling stupid shit without any responsibility.

Even Into Darkness gave me moments of enjoyment relative to what Beyond delivered.\nWhilst it's an impressive spectacle, I felt absolutely nothing for the CGI massacre that was half of the film's action scenes. Once the Enterprise was attacked, every scene was either an action scene or a dialogue scene talking about the possibility of an upcoming action scene. To me Beyond was nothing but what appeared to be a nostalgia bow wrapped around a thoroughly non-exhilarating series of explosions (and the Beastie Boys, obviously).\nIt's such a shame, as I really wanted to love this film.

Chris Pine has never felt more like Captain Kirk and I loved the scene where Spock found the photo of the original crew.", "Hm, where to start...\n\n2009's Star Trek gave them an in-lore reason to retcon all of TOS and forward with the arrival of Nero. It did not, however, give them reason to retcon anything *before* that, which they did with the USS Franklin. It had a registry number indicating it came after the NX-01, but the timeline indicates it came before it. Additionally, it was said to be Warp 4 capable, which makes it slower than the NX-01, the first Warp 5 ship. Finally, the Federation was only beginning to be drafted at the end of ST: Enterprise in 2155, meaning the Pre-ENT era USS Franklin (and her crew) would not have even been aware of the Federation, let alone grow to hate it. \n\nWhile I love a good action flick as much as everyone else, I have to say I'm disappointed that the Enterprise gets #rekt yet again. While it was common for the crew to come into dire circumstances in previous Star Trek titles, the amount of times the \"JJPrise\" has been blown to smithereens or hopelessly outgunned is absurd. In 2009's movie, it gets shredded by the Narada before Nero recognizes the registry number. In Into Darkness, the Vengeance turns it into a pinata, and in this movie, the poor girl is quite literally torn into no less than 4 pieces before plowing unceremoniously into the ground. In the words of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow... \"STOP BLOWING HOLES IN MY SHIP!\" The Enterprise is supposed to be the flagship of the Federation, the most advanced ship in the fleet, and more heavily armed than the TOS era Enterprise due to the perceived increased threats in the universe after Nero's incursion.  \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the new warp effect. A fairly minor nitpick, and while it *looked* cool, I don't like it as a warp effect. I really liked the blue-white effect seen in 2009's Star Trek & Into Darkness. Very impressive effect.\n\nI loved how the supporting cast got more screen time, helping separate this chapter from the \"Kirk & Spock Show\" that was the original series. I especially appreciated the growing relationship between Bones and Spock. \n\nThe story seemed more... adventurous, but at the same time, cliche. Of course the distress signal is a trap, of course the Enterprise gets rekt, of course the villain is someone with an unlikely connection. A mining colony with a bunch of drones left behind, and a technology that conveniently mutates a human into a psychic-capable lifeform who can telepathically control the hive? Uh. That's stretching it even as far as Star Trek goes.\n\nI dunno folks. I came away from the theater with a bittersweet taste in my mouth... it was a great, amazing action flick... but a mediocre Star Trek movie. ", "\n\"Star Trek: Beyond Plausibility\"", "Disclaimer: I went into this movie having not watched any trailers or read any reviews; knowing nothing what it's about and went in with the expectation to hate it. \n\nAs a huge fan of everything Star Trek except this new movie series, I honestly feel this one is the closest they've come so far to making a real Star Trek movie. While the character motivations and development of the antagonists could have gone a bit deeper, I still enjoyed it as it \"felt\" like Star Trek much more than the first two movies. \n\nIt genuinely felt that the characters in his movie used their skills, actions, and words that they had in the original series, instead of merely reference them as fan service as they did in the previous two. ", "When they referenced the giant hand episode (\"Who Mourns for Adoenis?\" from S2, Scotty mentioning how some say the ship was taken by a giant hand) I loudly cackled in the cinema. Apparently no one else in the theatre got the reference... got some weird looks", "Just saw the movie last night. I didn't even realize it was opening night. I thought the movie came out weeks ago! Silly.\n\nAnywhere, here are my thoughts:\n\nI don\u2019t go to a movie theater too often these days, but when I saw Star Trek Beyond I couldn\u2019t help but leave the theater with a huge grin on my face. It\u2019s truly the best blockbuster of the year.\n\nI was never a huge Star Trek fan growing up. I certainly appreciated it, but I come more from the Star Wars persuasion. That\u2019s not to say I dislike Star Trek, it just never called out to me like other franchises have.\n\nBut when the rebooted Star Trek came out in 2009 (Another flick I saw in theaters) I was blown away. I know it didn\u2019t cater to many Trekkie fans, but for a casual moviegoer like myself I had a lot of fun with it.\n\nI didn\u2019t follow the Into Darkness kerfuffle with the Khan leak and subsequent lie by JJ Abrams which angered a lot of fans, so I went into that film with absolutely zero expectations and knowledge of the potential plot. While I certainly didn\u2019t enjoy it as much as it\u2019s predecessor, it was a good popcorn romp.\n\nI entered this movie not expecting much. Somewhere along the way, writers and directors often lose steam and forget what made earlier incarnations great by the time the third movie in a franchise comes around. Look at the third Matrix, Return of the Jedi, or Godfather 3.\n\nStar Trek Beyond not only avoided this pitfall, but actually surpassed it\u2019s predecessors in spades.\n\nComing at this movie with little background in Star Trek besides some casual knowledge, I\u2019m sure I missed a lot of easter eggs and fun nods to previous installments. But right from the start, Chris Pine\u2019s performance as Kirk was spot on. There were lines delivered that elucidated Shatner\u2019s legacy, but not in a cringe inducing way that took audiences out of the movie. It felt true to the character, and really made me appreciate Chris Pine\u2019s dedication to the source material.\n\nSimilar performances by Karl Urban as the always loveable Dr. McCoy, and John Cho as Lieutenant Sulu were spectactular. The Kirk-Spock-McCoy dynamics played out really well, and helped drive home to audiences that these are good friends who\u2019ve been out on the fringes of space for several years with little respite and contact from home. A little humor every now and then probably helps to keep ones sanity intact, so Simon Pegg\u2019s take on the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott is always a good ice breaker for the crew.\n\nOne of the things I appreciated most from this movie was that inversely, the stakes were not as high as in earlier departures into space. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there were still a lot of plays ripped straight out of the Hollywood playbook. There\u2019s always a lot destroyed buildings, implied civilian casualties, and carnal violence between the protagonist and the baddie that devolves into hand-to-hand combat. But the fate of the Federation, Starfleet, and parallel universes were never at risk, and it was a nice departure from having to keep \u201cone-upping\u201d previous movies in a vain effort to keep audiences engaged and the tension high. The film set out to tell another story of the dangers of wild space, and it accomplished it\u2019s mission.\n\nI don't want to keep this wall of text going, so you can see the rest of my thoughts on my blog if you guys would like to check it out. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4u0i4z/official_discussion_star_trek_beyond_spoilers/", "lifelong Star Trek fan here.

It's not the original Ghostbusters in most ways, but it was never going to be and that's fine.  It's still a fun comedy movie with cool looking ghosts in it and plenty of good jokes.  It lacks the subtlety that the first one had, but it does it's own thing and does it in an enjoyable way.  \n\nAlso, extra points for the ghosts.

I had a few chuckles, mostly due to Patty and Holtzmann\n\n* I was going to enjoy Melissa McCarthy's character and hate Leslie Jones' character. Again, I was wrong, I loved Leslie and hated Melissa.\n\n* I was going to cringe a lot and feel like I was watching a poor attempt at a Nickelodeon movie. PMI.\n\n* I would come to like Chris Hemsworth's character. NO. I hated how completely and utterly stupid they made him! I felt that it was an insult to the bumbling sidekick character.\n\n* Leslie Jones' character was going to be a painful stereotype of my fellow black women. I was pleasantly surprised that while that cringey \"The power of Patty compels you!\" scene was still in the movie, she wasn't nearly as cartoonish as she was in the trailers, and I loved the fact that she had a love of New York history.\n\nNow, lets get to the meat of this disappointing sammich. \n\nThe pacing is sooo bad. This movie feels so slow, and I was disappointed at the fact that they didn't have a ghostbusting montage! What the hell, movie?! The \"we're gonna shut you down\" scene with the mayor and his annoying bitch of an assistant came what felt like way too soon, and had there been a ghostbusting montage, maybe it wouldn't have felt so rushed while at the same time taking forever.\n\nThe movie's villain is boring. PMI\n\nThe climax was cool at some parts, I chuckled at Slimer's scenes in the ECTO-1. I loved Holtzmann's ghostbusting solo. I loved when the villain turned into an adorable version of the logo for two seconds, then pulled a Gozer and turned into a giant. \n\nI hated the fact that the girls literally *shot the franchise logo in the dick.* What the hell, movie?! That wasn't funny, that was just stupid!\n\nI wasn't sure how to feel about that \"Kristen Wiig saves Melissa McCarthy and their hair randomly turns white\" bit. I get the whole \"I'm not leaving you again\" thing, but it felt so ridiculously cheesy. I actually didn't notice until my sober viewing of the movie that Melissa McCarthy pushed Leslie Jones out of the way of the villain and that's how she got sucked into the portal.\n\nI'm just glad they were able to get the firehouse at the end of the movie.\n\nRating: 2.5 disgruntled slimy Venkmans out of 10\n\nFavorite Line: I honestly can't think of a line memorable enough to call a favorite.\n\nFavorite Character(s): Patty's uncle and Holtzmann's mentor\n\nFavorite Scene: Holtzmann's ghostbusting solo", "I think part of the reason I didn't care for it is because Paul Fieg works better when his films are R Rated.

Turns out she was only annoying in like one or two scenes and they were mostly revealed in the trailers anyway. Leslie Jones gets a lot of flack for being the loud black lady trope but all in all she was good.\n\n* Kate McKinnon was funny and I want to see her in more movies. She's one of the better actresses on SNL right now and has been for quite some time. She knows her role and brings it every frame.\n\n* Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy were fine, not great, but fine. Chris Hemsworth's character had wayyyy too much goof to him.\n\n* Does every movie these days need to have a 10+ minute epic fight scene that parodies or at least comes close to parodying *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* or *Matrix* stuff? I got annoyed by that.\n\n* Like I said, this version invites a lot of comparisons to the original. From the cameos (which were distracting) to the music (I hate the Fall Out Boy version), to the little nooks and crannies here and there (did anybody notice on the back of the proton packs, the power level on one of them in the climax said 1984?) it really wants to be compared to the original rather than try to stand on its own two feet. If they had cut it in half it would've been fine, but it almost looks like after the criticisms and/or test audiences had a look at it, they had to go back and add more form the original back in.

(So the 1984 film's big fight happened at the *top* of a skyscraper, so what if we had the big fight happen at the *bottom* of a skyscraper? Answer: It turns out that's visually pretty boring.)\n\nBut the far larger problem is that this is simply a bad film: While the main actors all carry a tremendous amount of weight, they are left disappointed by a supporting cast that seems most interested in figuring out where they can collect their paycheck. The script is discordant, self-contradictory nonsense. The editing appears to have been carried out by a semi-sentient hacksaw.\n\nAlthough perhaps I disparage the editor too much: The credits do us the \"service\" of showing us a scene clearly deleted from the film itself which is so unimaginably awful that one can only imagine that the editor's primary job was to chart a treacherous course through raw footage that would be better described as raw sewage.

Of course in the Marvel movies there's already plenty of humour, but not to this extent.\n\n- I really liked Kristen Wiig's character, and McCarthy's character grew on me during the movie. Leslie Jones didn't play the overly stereotypical black woman that I suspected from the trailers but there were still some cringey moments. Kate McKinnon's character took me out of the movie quite a few times because a lot of her on screen time is devoted to being weird. A lot of those times the weirdness is a little too much, and out of place.\n\n- The characters as a whole had some alright to decent chemistry going on with the exception of Kate McKinnon. In the sequel (which the post credits scene hinted at - Zuul) they'll have to definitely tone her down, or give her some more sensible lines that are less random.\n\n- The CGI was fine. Only one moment was glaringly bad, and that was when they were going through the vortex near the end of the movie.\n\n- The villain was uncharismatic (until he took possession of Hemsworth's body) and overall I didn't feel like his motivations were very clearly explained.

Nevertheless, it's certainly not a bad movie, and it's decently entertaining.\n\nCatch it on DVD though.\n\n\nEdit: description of the villain above says 'uncharismatic' by which I mean that he was largely uninteresting and unimpressive whenever he was on screen.", "Took my mom to see it and she laughed two maybe three times. So that was a win since she doesn't find humor in anything. I didn't like it at first but by the end I was satisfied. Kate McKinnon was awesome, I loved her character.

Hemsworth was pretty generic and I didn't find his scenes to be anything great. 7 out of 10 for me.", "People compared this reboot to Fantastic Four but honestly as I was watching it Ghostbusters: CURRENT YEAR reminded me more and more of Jurassic World. A mediocre movie coasting to success on the magic carpet rides of nostalgia and the popularity of its main stars. Not good enough to compare to the original, but not bad enough to get angry at for its incompetence. Instead Ghostbusters 2016 is irritatingly average. A bland success story, like McDonalds or Pizza Hut. Far from the worst movie of the year, but as far away from the best as you can find outside something offensively bad.

Not going to set the world on fire or be a constant rewatch for me, but it had some fairly solid laughs throughout.\n\nPros: I'm not seeing Zach Woods get nearly enough credit, his opening scene was really funny in my opinion. I laughed almost every time they showed a reaction shot of Kate McKinnon making a face, which I probably should have figured would happen because she's hilarious. Chris Hemsworth was funny. I had one big laugh, but I'm forgetting now what it was about. I thought all four of the actual ghostbusters were pretty funny, and they all sort of had a moment to show their value. \n\nCons: The action scenes with Holtzmann doing the whole whip deal didn't really do much for me, and the fact that the ghosts were somehow being defeated by the proton packs instead of just like tied up or whatever they did to the metal show ghost definitely strikes me as a plot hole. I rolled my eyes at most of the references to the original.\n\nI'm not sure why people are saying the movie was man-hating because I definitely didn't get that vibe in the slightest. Weird.

Went in expecting it to be horrible, but then I was quickly reminded it was supposed to be a comedy! It isn't meant to be taken so seriously and I found myself just rolling with the laughs. The only fault of the movie would be the villain. He was too serious  and disconnected with the overall theme of the movie. Really wished they would have stuck with the first ghost and explore more of the Ghost Jumpers. ", "I hated it.\n\nI didn't hate it because it was terrible. There were laughs here and there and the characters were not *as* grating or annoying as I'd thought they would be. But everything felt rushed and forced and so very \"meh\". The CG ghosts looked pretty bad. The plot had a lot of forced pathos, especially for the Wiig character. The villain is -- okay, Ivo Shandor was one of the coolest villains of all time because he put a plot into motion that took a hundred years to unfold, by shaping the infrastructure of the city itself. He was a chessmaster of the highest order. Even Egon grudgingly acknowledged his genius. The villain in this movie was basically Elliott Rodger, looking to feel big and important by causing chaos. The climax lacked the Lovecraftian undertones that made the original so much fun. The cameos, including Slimer and Stay-Puft, were wasted.\n\nMaybe I might've liked it if the 1984 and 1989 films hadn't happened. And I can see where other filmgoers might like it and I can see why. It's not as terrible as I'd thought. But God damn it, I can't bring myself to like it. And it's a crying shame because it's a Ghostbusters film.\n\nI guess what I wanted was something completely different. Don't just pack it with retreads and shout-outs to the original. That will only serve to invite comparisons to the original and this movie is doomed to be found wanting. These are different Ghostbusters. The same formula won't work again, so change it.", "Yeah it's just painfully mediocre. Solid comedy here and there and it was nice to see a bunch of HBO alums show up in small roles. I liked McKinnon and Hemsworth the most. I'll forget I saw this in a week. ", "I went in thinking the cast and director could make a great movie:\n\n(Many spoilers)\n\nThe Good: \n- The cast gives 100% \n- Kate McKinnon is really funny, she needs to star in movies \n- There was some pretty creepy atmosphere at different points in the movie \n- The dynamic of the four Ghostbusters worked (McCarthy and Wiig are the \"normal\" Ghostbusters, McKinnon is weird, Jones is loud) \n- The ghosts mostly looked pretty good \n- Got to park at the front of the theater since there were so few people there \n- Music and sound were great\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The cameos took you right out of the movie and weren't funny\n- Fart joke within first 15 minutes\n- The absolute most jarring Pringles product placement you've ever seen in your life. There was an intense scene happening and then a character started eating Pringles.\n-Nearly all the characters are played for laughs... it takes weight out of the story when the mayor, his aide and the FBI aren't played in a serious way.\n-You never seem to really care about the characters or feel for their struggle.\n- The big boss at the end of the movie sees the four Ghostbusters SHOOT THE FINAL BOSS IN THE GROIN WITH THEIR PROTON PACKS.\n- Lots of product placement\n\n", "It really beat my expectations. Wow\nSolid 3ish/10", "I saw it at a screening a few days ago and my theater applauded several times during the film.

I get that we're Americans and we applaud for credits and plane landings but it was a bit much.", "It's fine.  \n\nThoroughly entertaining in a completely not groundbreaking or original way.  Just light comedy that succeeded in being funny (the worst jokes were in the trailer.  The cast works really well together and deserve to be written a better story, the story that is there is totally saved by the four leads and Hemsworth though.)\n\nSeriously;   it's fine.  Kids are gonna love it.  This will be a lot of kids first Ghostbusters movie and that isn't a bad thing.  It totally succeeds in being a good introduction of the franchise to a new generation (kinda like, say, the newest Star Wars...hell, much like that one;  it includes an original  cast member who clearly only agreed to appear if they killed him off).  There's just not that much more to the story for fans of the original since it essentially just turns into a remake for the last 30 minutes.  The MANY cameos were there for us though and they were a lot of fun.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone who feels a new Ghostbusters is sacrilege,  but for teenagers or kids who have never seen the original, it's good.   Or someone who is just looking for a laugh and is a fan of Paul Feig movies.\n\n  Can we get the hell over it now?  It's perfectly okay, occasionally quite good and thoroughly funny.", "I wanted the movie to be good, but it just wasn't. I found all of the characters obnoxious in their own respective ways and overall didn't have good chemistry. Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth were the best of the bunch, but still weren't phenomenal. The other three just didn't do it for me. The movie had some chuckles, but nothing that got a good strong laugh from me.\n\nThe visuals were good in spots, poor in others, although the 3D was pretty well done, and it had one of the worst villains I've seen in a while. The cameos and nods to the originals were very poorly done and felt like they were trying to cover up the poor movie with nods in an attempt to make people like it. Too much fan service can be a very poor thing, especially when it prevents the movie from standing on its own from the original. The only good one for me was the Harold Ramis bust.\n\nOverall, poor execution led to a bland film that was good in spots, poor in others. It was better than the marketing made it look, but not by much. 4/10", "The pros:\n\n* I thought all the actors did a great job. They're all very funny people and even with weak writing they were able to be funny throughout just with their natural timing and mannerisms. \n* They didn't try to slow-walk us through any boring exposition. This could also be seen as a minus, as sometimes it was unclear exactly what was going on, but it was nice not to have a character explaining the physics of ghosts or how it's supposed to be plausible. \n* The \"mike hat\" joke made me laugh way harder than it should've. Chris Hemsworth has great comedic senses; I hope he does more comedies in the future. \n\nThe cons:\n\n* The writing was pretty awful even for a summer tentpole comedy blockbuster. \n* There was almost no group cohesion. I realize that this is somewhat of an origin story, but at no point did it really feel like a group of 4 close individuals banding together to battle ghosts. The group dynamic felt very disjointed and unorganic and really took me out of the moment. \n* There was never really any sense of danger or stakes. We never saw any ghosts (or people) do anything particularly heinous, and the human villain was onscreen for all of 5 minutes, at which point he becomes some kind of nebulous transferring ghost with questionable abilities and unknown motives who's going to do...something? The plot was really clunky overall. \n\nConclusion: It was mildly entertaining, but definitely didn't need to be made and certainly could've been done better. The actors all do a good job with what they've been given, it's just that what they've been given is pretty lame to begin with. \n\nGrade: C+", "[removed]", "Loved growing up with the original two films.\nI played the game when it came out, and loved it - I've always considered it Ghostbusters 3 and the trilogy was closed.\nSO!

Like she couldn't find a middle ground on how to act.  But her character itself was really annoying and over the top like the dancing with the torches and going through the knew weapons.  \nI felt like McCarthy and Wiig thought they were in Brides Maids with the humor that they were going for.  I thought Brides Maids was a funny movie but those characters didn't need to be in this movie.\nI think Jones had the best character that actually acted like someone would, and she wasn't bad in this, but it was like why does this lady know everything about everything about NY?  They could have made her last job a tour guide instead of an MTA.  And also did she quite that job or get fired?  Hemsworth was pointless really in this movie.  Yeah he was dumb and goofy but the plot would have been the same if he wasn't in it.  The villain could have just possessed Holtz and she could have jumped out of the window.  And where did he get a motorcycle from?  And what was all that shit on the motorcycle?  Did he just slap some shit on and grab some coveralls from nowhere?\n\nThis movie should have been GB3.  It would have worked a ton better.  All the originals have been retired or whatever and students or relatives could have taken over.  Patty could have still been the niece of Ernie Hudson who now owns a funeral home (that actually makes a perfect tie in).  Holtz could have been a student of Spengler and found all the old equipment when he retired or died and they could have tied in the other two somehow by just being friends or family or hired them off the street like the first movie.  That would have made the introduction of the new weapons way better and made a lot more sense, with just giving them an upgrade after being in storage for 30 years.  Instead in the course of like 1 week Holts invents like 7 ways to kill ghosts, and that itself was really weird since 4 proton packs in the beginning trap a ghost but at the end one pack can throw a ghost and than kill it.\ni just think they were very confused about how they wanted this movie to turn out.

Acting was stiff and had zero chemistry, and nearly every joke (all the ones involving the main cast) fall completely flat. Only Hemsworth looks like he's having any fun with the film, and it shows as he basically carries the whole thing. It also suffers from the typical Sony reboot pattern of replacing classic practical effects with really terrible cgi. \n\nNot as bad as it could of been, but I really hope this gets punished at the box office and ends up as the final nail in the coffin for Sony's bi-yearly reboot cashgrab.", "I have seen the film and went in with an open mind, not being a fan of the original Ghostbusters or Paul Feig. I didn't much care for it.\n\nMostly, it's the editing that threw me off so much. Scenes just cut rapidly to the next with little rhyme or reason. Whatever good story or plotting there might have been (I can see the makings of a decent, if not great plot, in the outline), it's just cut so hastily that I had to blink to make sure it didn't fly past my eyes. Eventually, the editing makes the film crash in on itself. \n\nFor all the scrutiny and criticism the new team gets, the film doesn't allow any time to breathe or take it in. It's just Satisfaction now, doesn't matter how it gets there. It's all \"Pay off, Pay off, Pay off\" with little set up. For a film that many defenders say wishes its own thing, it leans too heavily on its own legacy and even the cameos become too much to bear.\n\nIt's one thing if the trolls don't give the premise a chance. It's entirely another issue if the film undercuts its own premise with mediocre execution. ", "Eh, it was all right. Got its fair share of chuckles out of me, didn't feel like I wasted my money, but at the same time I don't think I'm going to remember it very much a month from now.", "Meh. I was at a theater that served beer, so that helped. Just made me nostalgic for the charm of the original. \n\nMy under 12 year-old daughters LOVED it. ", "I just came back from it. I saw it in IMAX 3D and there wasn't a whole lot of laughter in the audience; a bit of chuckles, but most of the jokes just withered and died on screen. It's shoddy, weighed down by the need to ape the original and place nods and winks throughout the movie.\n\nI have a fundamental problem with this movie, and it's pacing and camera work. \n\nSpoilers!!!\n\nPacing is a problem because this is supposed to be the first of third movies, roughly expanding the three acts of the original movie into three separate movies. So if you imagine the beginning until the first ghost capture, that's roughly the beats this movie was going through, except it pulled nods, references, and beats from the second and third act into this one. There's the fountain of ghosts from the second act, there's the city destroying ghost from the third act. So what are they going to do for the second and third movies? The mains from the previous films show up, and Bill Murray's character is simply there to be a troll (he's Peck without the authority or charisma), if you cut his scene out entirely, nothing is really lost, and it makes the scene make sense.\n\nNo, really, that's the other half of the pacing issue. Murray's character is thrown out a second story window by a released ghost, and then dies on the sidewalk. The cops arrive and then don't believe the ghost story.... which means it's a homicide investigation(?), but nothing comes of any of it. Yates single handedly gets Gilbert not only denied her tenureship in advanced physics at Columbia, but gets her fired. And there's no angst, and they're suddenly buddies! That's only years of work and her good name down the drain, it's nothing. The mayor pulls a Raiders of the Lost Ark card (...Top men.) but it doesn't go anywhere or do anything other than two agents and a 'dem govies and their alien secrets that are totes real, yo!' But \"the agency which they represent\" is all about cleaning up \"events\", so why are the people not actively shut down? They have a meeting and they're told to stop by one of the few women antagonists, then the next scene they're behind the chinese store and they literally say, \"and the mayor told us we could keep going...\" and I was thinking... wouldn't it fit to have the mayor actually say that in the scene that just happened instead of a cut and a sloppy backfill? or have this scene later on after they've been shut down for a bit? It's lazy.\n\nThe four don't have a lot of chemistry together, and that might be because there's very few scenes for the four to organically play off each other before the next Thing happens. And it's not helped by a sitcom like approach to shooting the scenes with lots of static shots and shot reversals. The one time it needed to be dynamic and fluid was the end, when it turned into a kind of Equilibrium, it was so poorly shot that I gave up on it. The scene with the first ghost turns into a 3d scary something coming at you jump, cuts away (reaction shot from the cast), cuts back (still puking at the screen). And there's a lot of stuff that goes over the crop (the black bars above and below the screen), like jewelry, or lightning, or projectile vomited slime. But why do that when you could shoot without the crop in the first place? \n\nThe main villain doesn't have any presence. He's basically like an autistic weeabo, and he's going to end the world because he was picked on. Magneto was picked on and rose over it and he's a character that is both understandable, and villainous. Anakin Skywalker is a walking rug for how the universe treats him, and he still is a respectable villain. For god sakes, Zod chewed the scenery and was a good villain. This guy is the second henchman of the main villain feel. I didn't feel a presence, or really care about him too much, and half of that was because we were *told* he's bad, and he's a victim, and never really *shown* anything other than he was just an autistic creepy fuck. And in a way the difference between him and Holtzmann is one's the good guy? Watch the movie. Swap Holtzmann and Not!Dr. Janosz Poha. He lacks the devoutness of a true believer, or the insanity of the truly crazed.\n\nOh, and they can kill ghosts now, suddenly in act 3. Why? Because it's cool? And because they needed to get through a log jam of ghosts without having to wrangle them all into one trap from a scratch together plan that might not work. So brawn. There's the setup to the song and dance number that thank god wasn't in the film. Because I would want a break from the rising tension near the crescendo of the third act for a Thriller number. \n\nI think the few characters that \"work\" are Holtzmann, who is just a caricature of a mad scientist, and Kevin who plays pretty but dumb to the fullest with a believable internal logic.\n\nYes, shot in the groin region. NotStayPuff was holding onto buildings when they initiated total protonic reversal of the building on the center of the ley line became a font for ghosts from another dimension, (combining how they defeated Gozer in the first one, the loss of the containment unit, and Dana Barret's building), and was not being sucked into the hole, so to make him let go, they shot him in the groin. It was supposed to be funny, but really no one laughed. \n\nThe movie ends on a kind of deus ex machina; the government realizes they're actually helpful--here's a blank check, but delivered by the woman adversary, no meeting with the mayor, or any other recognition, so if you cut out the entire mayor scene where they meet for the first time?\n\nSo in the end, they have zuul mentioned (after the credits), but they've already done the beats that directly preceded the arrival, and in fact caused the rift to start. Do they top it with a bigger explosion and a bigger NotStayPuff? Where ghosts are taking over the entire world? The keymaster and gatekeeper are coming. Everyone that has opposed the ghostbusters have been male and various levels of asshole or inept, or inept asshole. So gatekeeper female. Keymaster male. They have sex... I don't see that kind of dynamic even happening in this.\n\nIt's honestly a mess. I went, and I enjoyed picking at it, but I kept getting jerked out of the movie because of something that didn't click.", "[removed]", "It was not the worst movie ever.

In fact I think I liked her character best of all.  \n* The villain was good until the end.

Instead of an anthropological \"old gods\" supernatural explanation, they go for a \"science-y\" sounding, quantum mechanical bullshit explanation. I found all that _very_ off putting, and I hate it when most movies do this.

The only real negative was one of the cameos overstaying their welcome (two scenes and really only needed one). \n\nStick around for the credits. ", "Did anyone else think the off-the-edge 3D was distracting as fuck?", "The biggest issue was the comedic timing. Chris Hemsworth was reliably dumb. You always knew what you were going to get out of him even if his schtick was a bit frustrating at times. Holtsman was a little too quirky for me in that i never got the charm of her character. It wasn't as much as an Egon thing because Ramis played it pretty straight. The last big thing was the villain who had to tell the audience his motivation in every scene. It was just a bad script that no amount of improvising could save even if it was casted differently. Even Bill Murray falls flat in his scenes as the skeptical scientist. Overall it's just not good as it feels like the actors and filmmakers are restrained by the script, the gimmick, and the title of Ghostbusters.", "Just saw it. A very average film with nice effects. Most of the humor doesn't work. Which is not good for a comedy. Totally unnecessary remake.", "I finally saw it and while it wasn't as unfathomably awful as the trailers seemed to suggest, it's a colossal bore of a movie. The humor is very juvennile so young kids might like it, but most adults will probably roll their eyes. It's telling that the only joke that made me laugh was in the first two minutes of the film. ", "I hated it, the jokes fell flat, the ones that weren't about queefing or Patty screaming something anyways, Chris Hemsworth was funny as a Charlie Kelly style character, the cameos were fucking terrible, Ozzy Osbornes cameo seemed like it was filmed last minute in a rush, he said it as if a fan had asked him to, he was half laughing as he said it which made it terribly funny. Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd cameos were just painfully forced, giving constant equally as forced nods to Ghostbusters, also the Fallout boy song sucked, they couldve written a new song but nope they just cover the original, which anyone could do, but how else do you get people to watch your film without Fallout Boy, the cast were by no means a problem. They've all proven their chops but I just don't see the sense in choosing ghostbusters as a reboot, why not have an original idea that can star four people? \n\nI don't know, I hadn't even seen the original Ghostbusters so I'm not hating on this for \"nostalgia\" or \"fuck women\" I just fucking hated the film.", "Watched this movie a couple of days ago. The begining of the movie was actually decent enough to watch pretty funny here and there and did a good job of getting the viewer into the movie. But as the movie continues jokes become forced and the movie just gets very boring overall. The cameo's are a nice thing here and there but some of them are just weird. The whole weird 70's disco dance thing that Chris Hemsworth character forces everyone to do towards the end of the movie is just weird. I also can't stand the credits with the dance they are trying to make a thing. \n\nGod I can't believe they are making a second part to this reboot. My wife couldn't stand the movie what so ever. She hated Kate McKinnons character but really was surprised by Leslie Jones character outside of the few trailer scene's that we saw entirely too much. \n\nBTW for those of you who did see the movie was it just me or did they do a really piss poor job of building up the Neil Casey's character. I just felt like they said okay hes a weirdo he was teased or bullied but somehow he was able to make all this amazing scientific shit and yet he's still just a janitor at a hotel and wants to ruin the world by bringing demons and ghosts to our realm.\n\nOverall I wouldn't waste my money on this movie.", "My fiance and i saw it last night, we both really enjoyed it. After talking about it, we felt that one of the reasons the trailer kind of fell flat comedically was because a LOT of the humor was in extended conversations, and was very character based. Very difficult to, say, pull individual jokes out of Chris Hemsworth's first scene, but the quick percussion of jokes, Kristin Wiig fawning over him, and immediate call backs to him covering his eyes when something was too loud were just hysterical to us in the moment. Fewer one liners, more individual scenes that built and built and were funnier and funnier. Really, really loved it, and I'm a huge fan of the original. ", "It's not awful like people (myself included) assumed it would be.  But it wasn't good either.\n\nIt's biggest downfall for me is the lack of chemistry within the cast. It just felt stiff to me. Wiig was fine but not memorable. I've never been a fan of McCarthy, so I wasn't really surprised I got what I expected out of her. Jones was fairly obnoxious, not the full blown stereotype people criticized her for, but is easily the least likeable of the group. I still don't really know how I feel about McKinnon. Seems alot of people are taking that stance as well, with people saying she's great and others terrible. She wasn't godawful but not necessarily someone I was eager to see in other scenes. One thing I'd hoped when they announced this film was that the cast would be a group Feig hasn't worked with frequently. A group who could use their collective styles of humour and create the same unique chemistry Murray, Ramis, Akroyd and Hudson had. I was always keen on seeing Tina Fey, Rashida Jones, Emma Stone and Aisha Tyler as the 'busters. But instead we got three SNL alums and a Feig regular, so I went in with a general \"it's gonna be same old shit\", and frankly it's what I got.\n\nThe film had a fairly decent support cast. Seeing Charles Dance was a nice surprise.  The cameos from the original cast is quite distracting and makes it somewhat more harder to try and avoid comparing it to the original. I always knew Chris Hemsworth was capable of being funny, so it was nice to see that confirmed. \n\nThe plot is pretty straightforward. Guy wants to destroy the planet yadda, yadda, yadda. The villain is pretty one dimensional and forgettable. The overall way men are depicted is pretty disappointing. They're either idiots or assholes. \n\nBy itself, it's definitely not as bad as the marketing suggested, but not the great movie alot champion it as. By itself it's a passable summer movie that will probably be forgotten in a month or so.\n\nBut it bares the title *Ghostbusters* and considering my love of the original, I feel I should at least chime in on how it stands in the franchise.\n\nI watched Chris Stuckman's review before I saw the film and the thing that stuck out to me was his comment on what a reboot should be: something that builds upon on the original. It's what should be the main reason to reboot something. \n\nPretty much it's a paint by numbers comedy/studio film. Similar jokes like other recent comedies, the CGI is overbearing and it does make the green screen seem very apparent.\n\nThe characters don't really stack up to who they're standing in for. If I'm correct, Wiig is Murray, McCarthy=Akroyd, McKinnon is Ramis and Jones is Hudson. Peter, Ray, Egon and Winston were very distinct characters, and each's personality and chemistry with one another helped the overall quality of the film. The character of Erin Gilbert, Abby Yates, Jillian Holtzmann and Patty Tolan just didn't really seem to mesh. None of their personalities really stood out aside from Holtzmann, who I still don't know if I liked the personality or if it was trying too hard. And Jones really fails to be a good replacement for Hudson. What I liked about him was he just sort of strolled in, said \"fuck it you pay me I'll believe anything\" and quickly established himself as a unique personality. The reboot seemed like it wanted to have a reason for Tolan to be there when they really didn't need to.\n\nSo, viewing the film as a Ghostbusters film to be compared to the original, it just doesn't. It's not as fascinating or entertaining.\n\nSo, overall I say if you like it, all power to you. I'm on the mixed to negative spectrum where I don't hate it or despise it, but I wouldn't be aching to go see it again and probably wouldn't recommend it to friends. \n\nIf you're a Ghostbusters fanatic, do your best to view it as its own thing, because you may or may not hate it.\n\nAs for the post credits scene, I always hate films that sequel bait in their PCS, so it definitely wasn't something I liked.", "It seemed very average. My first thought was that it didn't respect the intelligence of the audience. It tried to explain too much and left nothing to discover. Case in point: the whole scene just thrown in there to explain all the gadgets. imagine if you hadn't seen that and just had Holtzman just hand out those things at the big fight. You'd get to learn what they do right there and be wowed by them. But no, you were already spoon-fed that, so it's not as impressive.\n\nCouple of good jokes. I laughed at the Irish joke in the beginning and the front fart joke (albeit a bit childish). The rest were average.\n\nPlot seemed moderately stable. Pacing I thought was a bit forced at the beginning. Like, Oh! Patti saw a ghost, now she's a ghostbuster, because she said so. or Oh! I just happened to quickly make all these things in the last two hours for us to use to fight something we didn't know existed until right now. How convenient.\n\nThat being said, I thought the end battles and the overall story line did their job and came to a complete and logical conclusion. I don't think I'll need to see it again, but not mad I paid the $7.50 matinee price to see it. ", "Saw it last night...they were literal cartoon characters. Nothing about them seemed human, it seems like they barely had a script because most of it was improv, but shit improv...like winking at the audience improv. Could have easily made it into a \"here's a Boston all female team of Ghostbusters\" and made a straight forward movie but they had to undercut it with \"men are dumb, men are assholes, you're a misogynist\"\n\nI don't want to compare it to the first Ghostbusters, but they actually had characters that's you'd see in real life, these characters were faker than that terrible CGI at the end.", "This movie was better than I thought it would be. Kate McKinnon was great. Her solo scene of attacking the ghost was great. Chris Hemsworth really did make the better. Yes jokes fell flat. The cameos were nice. The race joke was completely unnecessary. 6.5/10\n\nAlmost forgot. The original song is in the movie!", "Am I an alien? I felt like one. I found absolutely nothing funny about this movie.", "First two-thirds was fine, some jokes fall flat but others work, the last third was just awful, almost nothing funny or exciting happens, just dumb action that doesn't make sense. I guess I can't say it was disappointing because I had such low expectations but the movie was so close to being decent, they just fell flat on their face as they approached the finish line. ", "Saw it last night with my SO and we both really enjoyed it. \n\nIt didn't feel like the original Ghostbusters movie - it wasn't really a remake or a sequel - but that's fine. It had it's own feel, largely defined by the cast interactions and it's existence in 2015 rather than the 1980's. \n\nThere were a bunch of laugh-out-loud moments, and even a surprisingly scary bit. ", "I tried to go in with an open mind and did not like it. Maybe all that was said about it before predisposed to that opinion. \n\nAs many stated before, for me it was just not funny, their seemed to be little to no chemistry, effects were pretty much the same throughout, and no performance stood out (even Hemsworth IMO). The 3D while gimmicky was good.\n\nI thought it started well enough but just got worse as it went on. I may be in the minority though as the audience around me laughed their heads off, mostly women which seemed odd.", "If Possessed Kevin could control those national guard soldiers... Why not just have them shoot the Ghostbusters? Or possess one and shoot them yourself? \n\nEdit: Those downvoting me, feel free to explain why my comment doesn't contribute anything.", "Even if the film was able to present something clever, like Hemsworth scratching his eye through his glasses, the movie ruined it by addressing the joke directly. There is no subtlety, and that kills any attempt at humor.", "Just got out of the theater. \n\nIt was an enjoyable film, but ultimately forgettable. Still I don't regret seeing it. Most films are forgettable. ", "I enjoyed it. It has nothing on the original Ghostbusters but it's not The Last Airbender. \n\nEdit: downvoted for saying I enjoyed a movie and didn't think it was the worst film ever made?\n\nTypical /r/movies...", "[removed]", "I saw a video review where a guy said the original Ghostbusters were not \"in on it\", whereas in this movie, the girls are completely \"in on it\". What does that mean? In on what exactly? I never watched Ghostbusters as a child.", "[deleted]", "I went into the movie really hoping to enjoy it, but it just didn't turn out that way. The opening scene started off horribly. The tour of the mansion and it's forced jokes (Irish Security fence/Barnum) ruined it for me. One of the great things about the original Ghostbusters is that it took place \"today.\" This is more of a comic book-style movie. \n\nThey spent way too much time showing the development of the logo and equipment. It seemed that every other scene had a new piece of hardware being unveiled. One of the best scenes in the original was the elevator scene where they first turn on the proton pack. That was our first time seeing the equipment and there was no explanation needed. The techno jargon was ridiculous and unnecessary as well.\n\nI can enjoy the occasional juvenile joke, but this entire movie revolved around fart jokes and one-liners. There were very few laughs in the theater, except from a small group of people. Everything just seemed so forced.\n\nOverall I could not recommend someone spending their money on this in the theaters. Maybe a Netflix viewing or a Redbox rental would be more appropriate. ", "As a fan of the original ghostbusters I feel this movie absoulutley doesent do it justice. Honestly I fail to see what so many reviewers are seeing in this movie. I love Kristen wiig and Mccarthy, but the jokes just fell flat to me. The biggest problem of the movie was it felt so phoned in. Leslie played classic snl sassy black lady leslie and it isnt funny in the slightest. However I guess the movie is more geared towards children, so what I find unfunny kids might think is hilarious. Also can i just remark on the fact that its ridiculous how black women are portrayed in movies, they're either loud obnoxious and sassy or ghetto. ", "That was a real letdown for me. Loved Bridesmaids, thoroughly enjoyed Spy, liked OG GB well enough as a kid, and this was a big pile of missed opportunities. \n\nSome of the jokes were amusing, but almost everything needed to have more teeth, be punchier. These women are capable of so much more, but the script didn't allow them to flex.\n\nPiddling amount of group dynamics. \"Cat's out of the bag\" was the only bit of riffing and bantering. Wiig and McCarthy were serviceable, which is a huge step down from their roles in Bridesmaids. I would have liked a more neurotic Wiig, and a zanier McKinnon. Jones didn't have much to do. The subway parts were unneeded, and having her be one of McCarthy's colleagues like McKinnon from the get-go would've allowed for more time on character development for everybody. \n\nHemsworth was fine, and I liked the saxophone and logo gags, but he needed more interaction with the rest of the crew for me to care about him being possessed. Being an object of lust for Wiig is okay, but that didn't go anywhere. \n\nThe villain was bleh and largely a plot device to get bigger and more ghosts on the screen. The cameos were just there, and added little. I enjoyed the climax visually. McKinnon dual wielding was done better than Vanko in Iron Man 2. Stay Puft looked good however briefly he was there. Not much Slimer either.\n\nI really wanted this to be good, but it's little more than passable. An unenthusiastic 5/10.\n\nEdit: a word", "It was really bad.\n\nThe story was a completely jumbled mess. The main villain is really terrible. About 90% of the jokes fall completelt flat.\n\nThe one character I did like, surprisingly, was Leslie Jones' character.\n\nPeople are praising Mckinnon in this film, and I went in excited to see what she was all about - I really dont get it. Somebody needs to explain to me what people saw in her performance because I just dont get it. \n\nThe biggest flaw was the writing. Just really terrible story telling. Scenes randomly thrown together with no real point and no real buildup toward anything. It was Pixels with a Ghostbusters skin. Actually, I take that back - Pixels was actually a more organized film. That is pretty sad. The people who wrote Pixels know way more about story structure than whoever wrote Ghostbusters.", "Honestly it was really boring. Kate McKinnon was the best ghostbuster by default because she was the only one given a personality that wasn't a racist stereotype. Chris Hemsworth got more character development than any of the four leads. The last 30 hours was a noisy, bright mess.", "The movie had its moments but overall I felt pretty meh afterward. It has been a while since I watched the original so some of my comparisons might be off.\n\nFor the most part the jokes fell flat. The humor felt much different than the original. The jokes didn't seem to come naturally. Instead it seemed like they wrote the sci-fi/action side and then remembered that Ghostbusters is a comedy and tossed jokes in. Definitely a Paul Feig movie titled Ghostbusters. Kate McKinnon was given the most opportunity to shine but her jokes especially felt like they belonged in a different movie. I also didn't like how the ghosts had to be brought out by a human. From what I remember of the original the paranormal was coming to attack humans of its own volition. It also felt like it was too much about Erin and not the whole Ghostbusters team.\n\nThe last thing I didn't like, or that I am at least indifferent on, was the visual effects. They weren't necessarily bad. The ghosts didn't look too fake or copy-pasted like some bad effects. However, the entire time I couldn't help but be reminded of the live-action Scooby-Doo movies.\n\nNow onto the things I liked. Leslie Jones was a surprise. Based on the trailer I thought I would have to suffer through all of her scenes but she was arguably the funniest Ghostbuster. The fight scene in Times Square between the Ghostbusters and random ghosts, while a bit cliche, was surprisingly well done, especially Holtzman's killing spree. It was also nice that they didn't copy the original too much in terms of the story. I think I would've liked seeing some non-Ghostbuster humans dealing with the impending doom similar to Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver but in the end I think it was better not to. While there were similarities to the original I think in the end this really felt like its own movie.\n\nThe nods to the original were fine. Slimer was my favorite of the cameos, followed by  Dan Aykroyd. Ernie Hudson's was pretty good too and Sigourney Weaver showing up in the credits was nice. Bill Murray being a ghost-denier felt like blasphemy and Rowan turning into a giant Ghostbusters mascot felt like the biggest rip-off of the original. Finally, I get why they felt the need to pay homage to Harold Ramis but the bust of his head felt cheap and forced.\n\nTL;DR: Pretty meh. Not the worst thing ever. Has its moments and its flaws. Doesn't ruin the Ghosbusters name. A passable summer action comedy.", "\"It's 2040 and the president is a plant.\"\n\nI was really rooting for Feig to knock it out of the park with this one and shut all of those damn babies up. I love the hell out of *The Heat* and *Spy*, but I can't bring myself to even like *Ghostbusters*. Existence is the key to every remake/reboot and there is nothing here given to warrant that existence. Humor is hit and miss most of time, though it can be very hilarious at points, but in the end all the efforts put forward just comes off as lazy (the Ghostbusters logo as the final boss? That's the best they can do?). The cast is just fine (Hemsworth is a standout), but McKinnon (who speaks the absolute worst line in the film, at the top) is just horrendous. [Ernest](https://media3.giphy.com/media/trjUtMbysPNLO/200_s.gif) himself would be annoyed with her mugging. I'm positive McKinnon is a capable of a really fantastic performance in a big movie, but this is not that performance and this is not that movie.", "Just got out of seeing it and ... it was rough. \n\nRemember how it took years for Guns 'N' Roses to release \"Chinese Democracy\"? This felt like the Ghostbusters realm equivalent. It was always on the table as a possible third film (second sequel), but it languished for too long. Then when the unforeseen happens (another band member leaves; Ramis dies), you go on because you have to and make due, even knowing you're missing a key piece.\n\nI've seen the original (and the sequel) many times. I saw the first multiple times, maybe too many, in the theater since I vividly remember Mom saying \"Ghostbusters? Again?\" So I can honestly say the best parts of the new film were the homages to the original. I was on a hunt and felt rewarded with each find.\n\nI loved the bust of Spengler at Columbia. Very nice comment there considering he was among the fired in the original. Ernie Hudson as Patty's uncle. Sigourney Weaver's cameo. I loved how Bill Murray was basically filled the shoes of Walter Peck, the guy he takes on in the original. Annie Potts' \"Whaddayaywant?!\" Dan Aykroyd as a convincing cabbie. Had a great laugh the ladies showing up at the original fire house (it was like seeing the Millennium Falcon in SW:TFA! Yisssssss!) and at Wiig scoffing at the cost (especially since it was ridiculously expensive in 1984). Patty's post-credits comment about Zuul.\n\nMcKinnon was too, too weird for me. All the jargon made me feel really lost; it was just too much. Wiig was on par -- wonderfully awkward with the occasional crazy, awfully timed outburst. I've seen McCarthy be a _lot_ funnier, but as someone said, to get a PG-13 rating, she probably had to play it safe. I know McCarthy and Wiig do a lot of ad-lib takes. I want to see outtakes or an unrated DVD release.   _Loved_ Leslie Jones. Wish we saw more of her.\n\nThe beginning dragged too long. To get dumped from two \"universities\" seemed overkill. And then it felt like the central plot couldn't take hold -- you're going between the gear (like a Bond film ... here are your toys) to finding/catching ghosts to overcoming the fraud label (more on that shortly) to some guy causing this chaos. I never felt that moment where the story clicks and you buckle in for the ride. Maybe after the ghosts are released en masse ... but that was real deep into the movie. And the trailers gave away too many funny parts.\n\nOne thing which felt strange was fiction imitating reality, the Internet backlash the women Ghostbusters face. A couple times I wondered if a scene might have been filmed and/or edited in to comment on the real backlash the reboot received. I'm indifferent if it was a form of social commentary. It just felt out of place. Or strangely ironic.\n\nIt can be a fun film if you recognize it's _not_ going to be the original ... and you also enjoy Feig's work. I'd advise fans of the original to at least see the first before viewing the new film, if only to jog your memory to help pick out the homages.", "It was like they made a third Scooby doo movie instead of a third ghostbusters. All of the characters were over-the-top and unrealistic (especially Leslie jones and her screaming fits). The CGI looked like it was from a Scooby doo movie too. Way too cartoonish for me to really appreciate it.", "My mother decided that she wanted to see it, so I went with her.\n\nShe said it was one of the worst movies that she had ever seen (I wouldn't go that far), which means that I can confirm that at least 66% of the people in our theater hated it.\n\nThe first five minutes or so (until the title shows up) had me pleasantly surprised and thinking this might actually be a good movie. Nothing laugh out loud funny, but a few sensible chuckles and a legitimately great first ghost attack.\n\nAnd then the rest of the movie happened.\n\nThe only other funny parts of the movie were Sigourney Weaver's cameo and the bit where Slimer joyrides (ghostrides?) the Ecto-1. The other jokes were at best facepalm worthy and at worst barely even registered as jokes.\n\nThe editing was also really sloppy, and the film never really built any momentum. In particular, they never established that the fourth one had joined the team, she just kind of hung around for a bit, brought a car, and then went out on the mission where they caught the first ghost. Another example is once Melissa McCarthy gets possessed, they somehow know who she's possessed by without them being given any indication that it's not just some random ghost. The scene also shows her smashing up the Proton Packs, but then they show up undamaged for the finale despite the audience never seeing them being fixed. \n\nSurprisingly enough, the music was pretty good. I didn't like the Fall Out Boy version of the Ghostbusters theme, but they used it well enough that it works in the context of its scene, and the orchestral version of the theme playing during the fight scene at the end of the movie was actually pretty great.\n\nAbout halfway through the film I was prepared to call it sexist for making all the male characters complete idiots.\n\nThen one of the Ghostbusters decided the best way to prove to a skeptic that ghosts were real was to release the big winged demon-looking one that they had caught so he could see it, another accidentally set fire to something while dancing, a third tried to hit a grenade like a baseball, and I realized that everyone in this movie is a complete idiot.\n\nOverall, 3/10 (my mom gave it a two,) would not recommend. It's not offensively bad, but it is a near total absence of anything good.", "Saw the movie on Thursday and was shocked at how empty the theater was.  There were less than 20 people for the screening.  Despite the controversy surrounding the film I thought there would at least be an initial wave of curiosity.\n\nThe movie was terrible.  It boils down to one thing in my opinion which is everything in the movie felt forced and contrived.  The cast never seems to gel, the pacing of the movie feels slow and odd at times and the jokes are terrible and sometimes downright amateurish.\n\nThe cast always feels like they're just meeting for the first time or they're just acquaintances who happen to work on the same floor in the same building.  There's never a sense of camaraderie and by the time they got to the scenes where that came into play it just felt uninspired.   \n\nWiig, who I'd regard as probably the funniest of the group, felt totally subdued.  She has a couple of moments but overall I felt like she didn't get enough chances to shine.  McCarthy and Jones had plenty of jokes but the jokes that were written for them were so terrible it did nothing to help them.  And to be fair no one else could have saved the jokes either.  They were put in an impossible position.  Kate McKinnon, in my opinion, is the worst character.  If there were ever one thing you could pinpoint as an example of everything wrong with the movie it'd be this character. From her mannerisms to her jokes to her timing there's not a single thing she did that didn't come across as forced.  The only thing I can say for her is she is the only one who felt like they had any energy.  Everyone else felt like they were on Ambien.  \n\nChris Hemsworth was just in my opinion a toned down male version of McKinnon.  His character also felt forced and stupid.  The oafishness of his character ends up being annoying and lame more than it does funny. \n\nThe original Ghostbuster cameos were just meh.  Bill Murray seemed like he didn't want to be there and Akroyd and Hudson are kind of just thrown in with nothing really memorable about it.\n\nToo many call backs to the original and also they do a couple of pop culture references to other films that came across as annoying to me.  \n\nAfter seeing it and reading some critic reviews I was shocked at how many people seemed to enjoy it.  The movie felt unfunny and uninspired.  I'm blaming the directing and the writing on this one.  The cast itself could have been funny but they were never given a chance.  With a better script and direction this movie could have been good.  \n\nI'd wait to see this when it's out on streaming services.  It's not worth the money to see in theaters.", "Good airplane movie. Had some laughs here and there, story could have used a lot of help. They had a chance to do their own thing, and it just wasn't there. \n\nHowever, kids will love it. ", "It's not bad. Not good but not bad either. Solid 'meh' movie. ", "I finally saw it yesterday and I can say this it's not as bad as last year's Fantastic Four but even saying that it's still not a good movie.\n\nGoing in to this my expectations were as low as possible. I wasn't expecting a good movie just something that at the very least was decent.\n\nI'm in utter shock of how bad this movie is, it had all of the ingredients in place for a great movie and it just falls remarkably short.\n\nPositives: \n\nThe ghosts look fine, not great but good enough to pass in the CGI era and they do translate pretty well compared to their practical counterparts.\n\nThe action is the best part of the movie in my opinion it's fast paced & action packed and the proton beams look amazing in fact they look just as good if not more so then it did in 1984.\n\nAnd while I didn't care for the characters very much at the very least they do feel like a real team and I could feel the sense of camaraderie between them like real friends are supposed to have.\n\nNegatives:\n\nRowan is the worst villain I've seen in a movie since last year's Fantastic Four. If you thought most of the villains in Marvel movies were bad holy shit you guys have seen nothing yet, as unimportant as the most of the villains are in Marvel movies at least they have some kind of motivation driving them. Rowan's entire motivation for wanting to destroy New York City is because people were mean to him and he was bullied as a child and when it's revealed he read Erin & Abby's book \"Ghosts Of Our Past\" it looks like something an angry emo scene kid who hates his parents would write not someone who we're somehow supposed to take seriously as a villain basically he's Dr. Doom levels of bad.\n\nThis movie is a comedy and what's the biggest rule of a comedy? It's supposed to make you laugh and I'm sorry to say this but it's not funny in fact it's painfully unfunny. Any sense of character development & progression are completely ruined by dumb slapstick gags that try so hard to make you laugh that it just comes off as cringeworthy I mean there's literally a joke about queefing in the first 10-15 minutes & another joke debating whether or not the tour guide of the mansion shit himself I wish I were making that up but unfortunately what I just described is literally in the movie.\n\nThe characters are poorly developed and are reduced to lazy, tired stereotypes that are more regressive than progressive. Seriously you don't get to know that much about these characters and who they are and what they do and what makes them tick so ultimately you don't care about them or anything they encounter because you know so little about them in the first place to actually care. And yes the movie is extremely stereotypical you've got the smart, brainy one, the tough I don't give a shit one, the fat one who falls down, and the loud, obnoxious, black woman. In a age where we have strong, kickass, female characters there's literally no excuse for this you can make a great female-led movie without having to rely on stereotypes this is not progressive or empowering it's just lazy.\n\nKevin is a one note character who's whole purpose is to be stupid which is slightly amusing at first but gets to be pretty grating by the end of the film.\n\nEvery man in the film is portrayed as either an idiot or an asshole which is incredibly ironic considering the people behind the movie were calling others critical of the movie sexist. Although to be fair everyone in the movie aside from the main characters are grade A morons from the mayor down to the government agents, in fact there's one scene in the movie at the rock concert where the ghost pops out and everyone is partying like it's 1999 because they think it's part of the act I'm dead fucking serious.\n\nAnd finally to close it out Rowan is killed by being shot in the dick again I wish I were making that up.\n\nOverall this movie is aboutsely terrible. \n\nI didn't have very high expectations going in to begin with and even with that I was still let down.\n\nIf you like this movie and can get some enjoyment out of it that's great but for me personally I sat there waiting, hoping, wishing for this movie to make me feel something if anything and it never got to that point.\n\nThis is a movie that won't be remembered in a week let alone years from now.\n\nHell if they made a movie about the controversy & production troubles it would make for a far more interesting movie as it will be remembered far more than the movie itself.\n\nI would advise you not to see the film as their are so many options this summer that your time & money would be far better served elsewhere.\n\nThis movie's legacy should be only remembered for what it truly is: a cynical cash grab.\n\n2/10\n\n\n   ", "I went in to this with an open mind hoping that it would be better than it looked in the trailers.\n\n\nWell, it was worse than the trailers.

In fact, I think him, Hemsworth, Wigg and McKinnon could have been an amazing team with a different director! McCarthy and Feig drag this franchise through neon mud. \n\nNothing is coherent. It's a collection of SNL skits. It first and foremost attempts to be a comedy with sci-fi jargon occasionally thrown in to not fully abandon the concept. So, you either like McCarthy or you don't. She's pretty much full speed the whole way through with no sense of timing, no sense of chemistry, and never shuts up. McKinnon is left woefully begging for attention because her character is reduced to a series of reaction shots or lines. I'm completely fine with Leslie Jones' character, but she only joins the team because the script needs her to. It's crazy that besides Bill Murray, who was given an awful role, all the cameos played far better characters than the main cast with a combined total of about 45 seconds of screen time. What is up with almost everyone acting borderline apish? There isn't really any acting going on. It's basically a giant improv show with multiple dance scenes... The script feels unfinished with so much shoehorning going on it's amazing there is a plot at all. \n\nYou're second or third reaction to the trailer will tell you how this movie will turn out for you.

I fucking loved it. Had so many belly laughs, I love Holtzmann, great scares, great score. Can't wait for #2.", "I liked it. Some funny bits and cool ghosts. Wish there was a few more ghosts but that's fine. Kevin was really funny. Overall 7/10", "I saw the film last night, outside of Chris Hemsworth the movie was a disaster. The Ghostbusters had little to no chemistry. I would give it a 4/10, it is a rental.", "[removed]", "I'd give it a solid 4/10.\n\nAs a preface we watched this for free (well, work paid for it), the office is 90% women and the overwhelming majority didn't like it. I think of the originals fondly but it's not really my favourite.\n\nPlot: The movie had a pretty good setup at the beginning but unfortunately the plot fell flat. Nothing really ever felt at stake, there was hardly any tension, frustration basically it just felt meh. The team bonding through these felt kinda meh too as they had a good opportunity to collaboratively work on their gadgets with 3 high-level scientists but it turned out Kate was pretty much the one making everything (on screen anyway). The second adversary (the Mayor, etc) was just fluff. I'd prefer if they actually had something else to do besides the scene in the mayor's office. Also there was setup there at the end for them and the military to be used in the final battle and then.... nothing. Boo :(\n\nCast: The cast themselves were great I thought, but Kate McKinnon felt really hammy most of the time - she's basically a walking cliche and unfortunately that made Wiig and McCarthy's characters shine a lot less (especially Wiig). Leslie Jones, despite the backlash that was the first trailer, was actually alright and was just being Leslie Jones and was not overused in the slightest. Loved that she was a Train Station attendant though. Also their gender barely got any mention at all. Detractors who were worried about them being female, fear not. Hemsworth's character got old pretty fast, but he wasn't there that often and his persona changed a lot anyway in the second half due to plot. The actual villain dude however is so cliche, so paper thin, the fact that he was creepy was really just drilled into your face so much that it was getting really stale by the time he appears the second time. Can we actually have a genius villain in a funny movie that's not just the autistic stereotype?\n\nEffects: I love the updated effects from the original. The ghosts sometimes are a bit hit and miss, especially the more realistic one like the electric chair dude. The gadgets were cool and I wished Leslie Jones got more than one use out of that shredder (juicer?) I want more of those balloon ghosts though cause they were real creepy. The fat gluttinous ghost got a girlfriend and some comic moments but again it felt like his time on screen was wasted.\n\nJokes: Honestly not a lot I find funny but maybe it's because I don't watch SNL, that many other McCarthy movies, or, well, Paul Feig movies in general.\n\nTL;DR: It's got good potential but ultimately got bogged down by the association with the original Ghostbusters. Plenty of opportunities I felt got wasted by the movie and overall in one word I would describe it as *meh*.", "I didn't get the villain. I thought they were going to redeem him at the end or something and show there was good in humanity or some shit, because he was bullied and rejected by everyone and became that villain.\n\nBut no, he became a sexist asshole for no reason. I don't get that change in character. He hated everyone, didn't he? Not specifically women? Like he even compliments Patty at the beginning somewhat and says \"You'll be one of the last to die.\" or whatever. Why would he say that if he has all those sexist remarks?\n\nI didn't really get what they were trying to do with him. I don't know if he had some original intention but couldn't get it to work, or Paul Feig saw all the hate and saw it as a way to make a joke and turn him into a sexist asshole without rewriting anything else.", "McKinnon was fantastic as Holtzman. Loved her since I saw her on SNL, her whip scene intertwined with the iconic theme was superb. Hemsworth was also really good. Other than that the film was just ok. It's amazing how those two carried the film even when they aren't in it that much.", "The ghosts look like Scooby Doo.", "Better than i thought - still not great... but thor was fucking awesome. ", "Anyone who complains about the villain getting shot in the dick as some sort of \"misandry\" is being a jerk.\n\nLots of movies have dudes getting hit in the balls. It's pretty standard. \n\n21 Jump Street has Rob Riggle getting shot in the dick. And with a real gun instead of a cartoony sci-fi gun. ", "In a word, it was obnoxious.\n\nThe jokes were either awful or ran into the ground by them not knowing when to stop. We get it.  The principal of the institute hates you.  You know who Patrick Swayze is.  The cat's out of the bag.  The tour guide shit himself.  You don't have to beat it into us just to extend the runtime.\n\nThe characters were flat.  Holtzmann (McKinnon) started out charming, and then got annoying.  Her big moment in the climax, however, that was cool.  Patty (Jones) was another \"AWW HELLL NAW\" sassy black woman stereotype.  Not as bad of a stereotype as I thought, but still pretty bad.  Gilbert (Wiig) was pretty flat, mostly because she was only given two repetitive jokes throughout the film: her being slimed, and going gaga over their receptionist Kevin (Hemsworth), who is as handsome as he is dumb.  That's literally his entire character.  I don't really know much about what they were trying to do with Abby (McCarthy).\n\nThe climax had its moments, Slimer was fun to watch, but it was mostly ruined by the fact that not only is the villain a giant Ghostbusters logo (Like out of that terrible Transformers Famicom game where they have a Decepticon logo as a boss), but they defeat him by shooting him in the junk.  That actually happens.\n\nI am a feminist.  Not that good of a feminist, but I'm trying.  I believe in equal representation in film, and I've seen it work.  Mad Max and Star Wars are shining examples.  What I'm trying to say is that it's not groundbreaking to shove a bunch of women in a movie and pat yourself on the back.  Don't make a big fuss about it, just do it and make it good.\n\nBut hey, at least Ghostbusters II isn't the worst one anymore, right?", "Hated it for several reasons:\n\n- Misguided sexism\n\n- Horrible jokes\n\n- Awful villain\n\n- Bad CGI\n\n- Boring action\n\n- Poor acting\n\n- Unlikable characters\n\n- Uninspired plot\n\n- Zero passion or creativity\n\n- Desperate reliance on nostalgia", "There is absolutely so much to say about this.\n\nLeslie Jones' character was fantastic. Easily the best written character. She picked up the mantle of the connection between the Ghostbusters and the audience so well. The \"Power of Christ\" joke was still dumb though.\n\nI loathed Melissa McCarthy. Every time she was talking and it wasn't exposition, I was basically just hoping she would shut the hell up soon. \n\nKate McKinnon's character got old here and there, but the eccentric quirkiness popped up in some really great witty ways. She felt like the snippy reincarnation of Bill Murray's character. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the same kind of snarkiness as Murray, but it seemed to have the same idea behind it. \n\nKristen Wiig was pretty good, honestly. She played her role well, but I didn't give a shit about her backstory. One of the great things about the original two movies is that they established the characters in the here and now and put them in a situation where we saw those personalities flourish. We didn't need to know why Harold Ramis' character was obsessed with ghosts, we don't need to know why the new crew is. They just are, move on.\n\nChris Hemsworth's character was fucking stupid. The whole premise of being dumb eye candy is okay, I could have lived with that, but FUCK they made him too stupid. Like, why? He had his moments where the stupidity was funny (\"Me playing the sax, or me *listening* to the sax?\" had me laughing), but overall it was too much. He was fabulous as an actor, but I think the character needed revision.\n\nThe villain. Oh my. I really liked the idea of the villain. He's going to become a ghost and harness the ley lines to become this ultra baddie and wreck shop? Awesome. Great. The scene where the Ghostbusters confronted him, while he was still alive, though? Eh. The whole scene lacked real tension for me. \n\nLet's talk about the equipment. I *loved* the new arsenal. They built on the source material and brought a sense of freshness to the final battle. My major problem is that it was... destroying the ghosts? This didn't make sense to me. The proton packs (which were never explained, by the way, why not?) were used as ghost lassos to control and capture the ghosts, but never to destroy them (with the exceptions of the primary antagonists). A super easy fix to this would have been to have McKinnon's character throw out an explanation that the new arsenal would destabilize the ghosts, preventing them from holding a physical manifestation for a short period of time. Not a solution, but a tool to prepare the ghosts for capture. \n\nThen there were the ley lines. I liked the idea behind it, I did, but it felt rushed. Where the other team had taken time to research and figure out the unknown, this team knew the plan right away. They drew a few X's on a map, made a bigger X, and assumed they were ley lines. I would have loved to see more of these attacks happening, leading to a much more detailed map of the ley lines, which then the team could figure out. This just seemed to simple and, frankly, like the answer was handed to the team and the audience. There was no joy in the \"Eureka!\" moment.\n\nSpeaking of more attacks, it would have been kind of fun to see the ghost capsules piling up and McKinnon's character making a throne out of them, or people tripping over them, etc. \n\nThe ghosts themselves didn't look as cool as the practical effects of the original movies, but I didn't mind it. New movie, new team, new look. Sure. But why was that one ghost a demon? And do parade balloons have ghosts? Definitely a couple questions came up with the design of several of the ghosts. \n\nBill Murray's cameo was all right. I liked the idea of the character, but I don't see why they killed him off. Instead, they could have had the containment system fail during transport and the ghost escape (which they don't need to show), and the capsule be empty. This would have had the effect of justifying Murray's attitude towards them, and then lead into a joke later where he believes them. This is a played cliche, but much better than the murder of a known personality that just... goes away. The public isn't curious about it, there's no news about it, it's just forgotten. \n\nThe other cameos were okay, but I have to say the bust of Spangler was pretty cool. They didn't focus on it, it was in the background for people to notice, and it was really sweet. The character (or a version of it anyway) is immortalized in this new universe, as it should be. I definitely felt a small lump form in my throat. \n\nI'm sure there's more to talk about, like how comedic timing apparently disappears for 50% of the scenes, or how some of the scenes just dragged on, but I think I've rambled enough. Oh, or, why do jokes like the museum tenant confusing Jr with Sr even exist? Ugh.\n\nI'm glad I saw it so I could put the curiosity to rest, but I won't be recommending it to people to see in theaters. Far too much money for an overall mediocre movie.\n\nOH! One last thing. Why the fuck did they shoot the giant monster in the dick? What a stupid, stupid, stupid, *stupid* scene. ", "I found it amusing. It's not a smart movie and the villain is weak but it was fun.\n\nChris Hemsworth was hilarious. I haven't seen him in anything but Thor and loved him in this. His character was just so WTF dumb at times. \n\nI liked the crew. I thought that Jones was going to be a stereotype from the trailers but she was good. \n\nI haven't seen McKinnon in anything else to my knowledge but I loved her character. She played the quirky, smart inventor well without being too obnoxious as that was her role. She competent and that's what makes her not be annoying to an extent. \n\nWig and Mcarthy were good, not great but good. \n\nI can't remember the original Ghostbusters very well. I saw them and I remember liking them as a child. \n\nI was expecting a dull cheesy movie because of the trailer but it was overall well done in a way that made it fun.", "i liked the special effects, but the comedy was awful, it felt forced and not funny, and I understand why people avoided this movie and why 2 couples left.", "As the internet made me expect the worst thing to ever hit theaters, my expectations were shattered. Solid 6.5/10. \n\nMost of the humor wasn't for me, could have been more subtle most of the time. And the fact that they used the terrible Missy Elliott part of the song annoyed me. However, I definitely liked more than I disliked about it. Specific praises:\n\n- No \"easy\" jokes. No fat jokes or anything like that (which, after seeing some other Melissa McCarthy stuff, pleasantly surprised me). \n\n- No dumb love story. Every movie seems to have a dumb love story tacked on for no reason. This one didn't. \n\n- The immature jokes came from immature *characters*, not an immature *film*. At least most of the time. Subtle difference, but a big one. \n\n- There were a few cheap jumpscares but they were all in the first half of the movie. They actually did a great job of making you nervous during the latter half's ghost encounters.  \n\nI'm not too sure how I feel about everything having an \"origin story\": the name, the logo, even the jumpsuits. It's like, we get it, it's like the old one. \n\nThey spent a couple minutes explaining why Erin got into ghost hunting (the old lady ghost) and never expanded on it later, which I kind of liked and kind of didn't. Would have been cool if they did, but I always like when I can't predict a movie (or, rather, predict incorrectly). \n\nAnd finally, the climax being a nut shot dragged it down by at least a full point for me. I know it isn't supposed to be super-serious or anything, but... y'know, come on. \n\nAll in all I'm glad I saw it. ", "This movie was so much fun! I went in disliking the trailer a ton, but was super surprised by how good this was. It's an amazing comedy film! The original is still a better film, but it was a drama/scifi with comedic relief, not an actual comedy.", "I liked the movie! I was a bit worried after hearing things from the leaked script, but it wasn't that bad at all. It felt like Ghostbusters to me. \n\nThe only things I didn't like was the lack of ghost activity montages, and the logo ghost boss. \n\nWe really only got two quick scenes showing the indidual encounters with ghosts throughout the city once all Hell broke loose, the subway rats and the flasher ghost. With a movie with some pretty interesting ghost designs, I would have hoped for more. \n\nAnd I felt as though Rowan turning into the ghost logo could have been handled better (it felt contrived). Really, the villain could have been handled better all together. He felt too much of a cartoon in an already campy film, so it was a bit of unamused lack of suprise when he turned into a literal cartoon. That took me out of the film. Also, I would have much prefered the logo spawning from the GB's takedown of Rowan. \n\nLastly, I don't really see the whole \"man-bashing\" angle people have been coming from. The only male characters that were obnoxious were the Dean at Abby's university and Rowan. Kevin was the lovable oaf. The mayor wasn't really all that bad. Just the typical mayor you see in other things. Bill Murray was Bill Murray. Rowan getting shot in the dick was classic slapstick. No one would bat an eye if the Three Stooges hit eachother in the crotch. I'd even let slide Mckinnon's quip about men needing safty lights during the credits, because that's just her character.\n\nAll in all, Ghostbusters was a great summer film that doesn't really deserve all of the flack it gets.\n\nP.S.: Was that a bust of Harold Ramis outside Wiig's office in the very beginning?", "B, maybe a B-.\n\nJust got back from seeing it. I found myself laughing my ass off in the first 2/3 of the movie. Kate McKinnon is a fucking revelation as Holtzman. Leslie Jones steals plenty of scenes as Patty. Chris Hemsworth was hysterical (though the script ran a few of his gags into the ground). Funny enough, Wiig and McCarthy get the short end of the stick, as their roles are designed to be the heart of the film instead of purely comedic.\n\nThe early scenes were great, when the movie was mostly comedy. As it barreled towards more action, it became increasingly more divided. It was almost tangible how divided the comedy moments were from the action moments.\n\nDefinitely got bogged down in its last 3rd. Feig may know how to direct comedic scenes, but his action aesthetic is rather busy and lazy. None of the action scenes popped, and they weren't particularly funny, either. The chekov's gun of the sidearms felt really forced for no reason? The climax didn't feel earned -- they made a big deal of the \"final boss\" thing, then he did basically nothing menacing. Erin diving into the portal was very strange? I dunno.\n\nLoved the casting though and I hope for the inevitable follow up, they get someone else to do the directing. My dream would be for Edgar Wright to take a stab with this group of performers, but realistically, putting Phil Lord & Christopher Miller on the sequel would likely be fine and would improve leaps and bounds on the weak areas in this one. Not worthy of all the hate it will undoubtedly get from fanboy circles, though. Just a fine, slightly above average Summer flick with a bit of nostalgia working in its favor.\n\nEDIT: [I wrote out my thoughts more in depth here](http://wchare.com/2016/07/ghosbusters-review/).", "I went to the first screening at my local theater (in a town of 100,000 - which usually fills up for all early screenings)...and there were 30 people.

There are multiple issues with this scene that really just slug the movie down considerably.\n\nThe mayor and the government are well aware of the paranormal, and in fact list off several paranormal scenarios that were handled by the government, and introduce two federal agents who would handle the ghost terrorist plot from there on. Immediately, I was like, \"Well, wait. So who are those guys? Are they familiar with fighting ghosts too?\"\n\nThere were two options they could have taken from that point on that would have raised the stakes and made the movie more interesting. Instead they take neither, and go for a bland, middle road choice. \n\n1. The mayor could have said, \"Hey, you can't catch ghosts anymore, and if you do, we'll arrest you.\" Which would've raised the stakes because the Ghostbusters are now trying to save the city illegally.\n2. This scene implies that the government has been handling paranormal conflicts for a while now, but the mayor also gives the Ghostbusters credit for doing so well as amateur sleuths. So I thought, \"Well, maybe this ghost terrorist thing is part of a much bigger piece that the government is going to let the Ghostbusters in on, and have them help out.\"\n\nInstead, they take neither approach. The mayor basically tells the Ghostbusters that they can still continue their business, but just keep it low-key and not get involved with the current investigation. So the Ghostbusters go back with their tail tucked between their legs, are called frauds, and are just kind of like, \"Well, alright. This sucks, but whatever.\" Like, that just deflated a lot of potential energy that could've drove the movie through the second act.\n\nInstead, when you look at the original movie, the Ghostbusters are incensed, and get into a fight in the office.

The dialogue was complete garbage, every where from the over the top cartoony villains to the stereotypical black guy. Also a lot of the \"crazies\" I just could not take seriously. Comically overacting every line does not equal scary. The movies does pick up in my opinion around the end, but not enough to redeem it.

Everything had a good reason to be in the movie, and just for the sake of those nitpickers, we got to see Frank Grillo reload his gun, not once, not twice, not even three times, I think he reloaded over 5 times....TAKE THAT YOU PESSIMISTS.\n\n\nWhile on the topic of Frank Grillo: wow, this guy...he's the quarter in the penny jar. I'd like to see him in more action films. He's got the face for it, he's got the voice, and as we've seen in the last two installments of The Purge (and also in Winter Soldier & Civil War) he's got a knack for the genre that we haven't seen in a long time. So I say pull the trigger on this guy. Very pleased with him. \n\nThe rest of the cast was good, fairly good, I have no real complaints other than the dialogue from the school girls. They went a bit too insane. \n\n\n\nWhat I really appreciate is that the entire concept is set in stone with a bit of expansion, covering the stuff we were curious about in the first film.\n\nStuff like: Confirming the agenda behind the purge, what outside nations think of it (well...we know that some are interested), and most importantly, who the fuck has to clean up after the murderous antics of the night. Hats off to that guy. \n\n\n\nNow for one thing for me to nitpick, during the scene where the chopper shoots at the van, the kid blinks, literally right after she says he's dead.  That feels more like an editing problem to me, because the shot was a 2-3.5 second shot, you literally only had to cut off the last sliver. \n\n\nPersonally, fuck the critics (RT, at the time of my comment has a 57% rating for the movie), I think they nailed it with this one. and while it's not perfect. I'd pass the movie with like....a 3.5/5, 7/10, a C+, however you want to put it on your scale \n\n\nFunny enough, it kinda discredits the entire series because you don't even have to watch those two for this one.

The idea of these movies have always been way cooler than the actual films themselves. This is probably my least favorite one in the series. Way too many scenes of people running around in goofy outfits, dancing around and shit. It looks cool for a trailer but it doesn't need to be such a huge part of the actual movie. White Swat guys wearing confederate flags and nazi logos while hunting for the Senator. I thought the whole thing was just a plan by the NFA to frame another group for the Senator's murder. \"Oh it wasn't us, it was white supremacists!\" so they wouldn't look bad at the election. I thought we would get a scene were they got serious and took all that shit off but nope they actually walk around like that. There is such a lack of political subtext in this film that its almost eye rolling. We get it.

WTF.", "Totally did not realize that the actor who played Joe is the same actor who plays Bubba in *Forrest Gump*", "I have to say, I thought the first one was cool as a concept, but was executed a bit poorly. The second one was what the first one should have been, and seemed to be treated as a Purge night showcase of what goes on. This one seemed VERY gratuitous and crossed the line into sheer ridiculousness. \n\nI really liked the beginning. The emphasis on the music choices seemed almost like an homage to American Psycho, but I could easily be reading too much into that. I also enjoyed seeing the public services provided by anti-purgers, namely the ambulance and 'keep Washington clean' body disposal cart. I thought the church scene, despite the lighting being a bit... off, was pretty neat too. They really managed to capture that 'cult' feeling, with the ritualistic sacrifice and the ornamental stage setup. \n\nOther than those few things, the movie didn't really have many redeemable qualities. The movie may as well have been called 'Purge 3: Look at what the funny black man says next!'. The scene with the schoolgirls was blatant and needless sex appeal (not always a bad thing, just tone it down a bit.), and had some of the worst line reading I have ever seen. Not to mention the second time they show up they are talking to the security camera, although they have no way of knowing that Joe and Marcos left the roof, and are in fact inside the deli. Although nitpicky, I also find it hard to believe that their car cigarette lighter port could power what was at LEAST 8 strands of Christmas lights (Again, nitpicky. I am able to suspend disbelief for this one).\n\nThe fact that the mercs were skinheads was also a bit needless imo. It felt as though they were trying to go with the 'look just how bad we can make these bad guys' angle, which was unnecessary, the fact that they are mercs who like killing says enough. The tracking bullet felt very spontaneous and sort of came out of nowhere, felt like an excuse to be able to find them faster. Nearly every line spoken by these fellows was overly dramatic, as if it isn't okay to just have a normal conversation with a normal voice. When the drone was following Leo and the Senator around Leo says something like \"its homemade, it belongs to Purgers\". What is to say that the mercs can't have a shitty drone? Are only Purgers allowed to have crappy things?\n\nThe purge rules changing without any sort of vote (that was at least shown) seemed like a crutch and felt forced. You would think that people would question a sudden rule change, but it was pushed aside and was treated as a 'well, what happens happens' event, although being a VITAL piece of what made this movie. \n\nI may be a bit biased and grumpy because the last few horrors I have seen have been pretty mediocre. Regardless of my past experiences, this movie was overall pretty 'eh'.

It felt like a sequel to a movie that didn't exist, and was a much less interesting story because of it. I know there have been many Tarzan stories, but to create a new version of Tarzan and then just skip the most interesting part of his story, to me, just feels incredibly stupid. What was there was well enough done. Good actors, some solid CG, good action, but the plot was pretty barebones. Also, Tarzan's accent was weird. I'm usually a big fan of 3D but I found the 3D hardly noticeable in this one.", "8/10\n\nThe cinematography was beautiful and the direction was excellent, so many memorable shots.

I felt, if anything, it might have been a bit longer. There was a lot of unique film-making here. How problematic the race elements are...well, I don't really know. The Africans are depicted as warm, strong and brave. Admittedly, they could have been fleshed out more individually. I still think it was a really good movie though. ", "Hated the movie.

Definitely not the be-all-end-all film of the year, but definitely worth seeing in theaters. I had a blast.", "I enjoyed the acting and the camera work. Apparently I only need those two things to be good enough for me to enjoy a movie. I had a good time watching it, Christoph Waltz was a better bond villain in this than he was in Spectre, Skarsgaard had a good caveman posture, Robbie is a babe and I felt legitimately sad for Hounsou's character. ", "Ok, it's been a month and I finally watched it. I don't think many people will see this, but I will register my thoughts anyway. Here's why I didn't like the movie:\n \n \n* The editing is just weird. There's a scene where the camera is just rotating for no reason; sometimes the jungle background changes drastically, even though they walked only a little.  There's a scene where Jane jumps on the water, then the men on the boat start firing and only then you see the hippos chasing after her. She runs to the jungle,  in a place where the hippos couldn't possibly chase her,  and after you forgot about the hippos who never seemed like a real treat, they show a close up of the hippo yawning (as if it's mad it can't chase Jane anymore). In another scene, gorillas get shot by a bunch of armed man, and when their gorilla backup arrives they only show one man being killed by the gorillas, the rest of the man just aren't there anymore. There is no chase or whatever. People just keep teleporting  throughout the movie.\n\n* Sam Jackson carries a rifle and a belt of ammo through the jungle, he never uses it, then decides to drop it for a rifle he found laying on the ground.\n\n* Why is there an army of African warriors in the end?  Are they there just to celebrate a victory they could barely see? \n\n* Come on, Jane's hands can easily slip through these chains.\n\n \n* Why is Tarzan always staring at things and people with that sad look? \n\n \n* Tarzan says to the Warrior Leader: 'Cristoph Waltz will buy troops to enslave your people'. Warrior Leader says: ' He'd never do that.' Oh, I am sorry, do you know each other?  I had no idea you where that close to the other villain.\n\n \n* the cgi is just awful at times. \n\n  \n* the scene where Sam is opening his heart, why is he doing motions as if he is eating? He just tasted one ant! \n\n* why didn't they use *real* elephants for that shot? It wouldn't have hurt. \n\n \n\n That being sad, I thought the plot was simple but effective. Also, skarsgaard or whatever did some nice acting, the scene where he walks vigorously,  or where he is sitting like an ogre drinking a cup of tea, being the best examples.\nEDIT: formatting.", "Went to watch it today and it was so, so tedious. Very disappointing. Might just be me but I was hoping they went a more traditional route of keeping the movie in the jungle from the get-go, rather than start so late in Tarzan's life. \n\nWaltz was disappointing as a villain. The only villainous character where I've felt a little let down. \n\nI went in with the mind-set of 'If this can be as half as good as the Disney version of Tarzan, then this'll be very good'. It wasn't. Don't think I've been more gutted walking out of the cinema. Was looking forward to this film for a year, all for a tedious two hours.", "I thought it was really good, but I also thought the trailers looked great, so take that however you will. \n\nFor me, it was a solid 7-8/10. After Green Room and The Neon Demon, its the next best movie I've seen this year and certainly the best blockbuster. \n\nIt reminded me a lot of The Lone Ranger remake in that it was the type of swashbuckling adventure that is rarely made these days. There's a good mix of gritty action, lighthearted comedy, and romance/drama. Its a fun, more old-school adventure film. \n\nMy biggest problem was with the acting, or more likely the characters, since the actors are all talented. Tarzan himself was pretty boring - he seemed like a more realistic depiction of what someone raised in the wild would be like (basically, awkward, mostly silent, and very serious), but he wasn't a very captivating hero. Then, you have Robbie playing a clich\u00e9 heroine and Christoph Waltz doing another variation on his evil villain role. Sam Jackson is the only character who was both relatable and had depth, and in the one moment where he bares his soul and reveals his emotions, Tarzan just walks away to go look at some elephants. \n\nAlso, some directorial choices were odd. In one scene, the camera was spinning around the characters while they talked. Towards the end, there were several extreme close-ups of characters for no particular reason. Some of the scenes seemed to be made from mismatched shots.

I thought this movie was seriously great, didn't feel any pacing problems at all. It doesn't really break new ground in the story department, but then again, very few things do nowadays, and I think the little kids are least bothered by that. The score is gorgeous, animation is stunning, Rylance and Barnhill pulled phenomenal acting chops to the table. The long shots and dream-making scenes were very imaginative. My favorite part of this movie though is the BFG's dialect; in most films that try to introduce a new English dialect, it feels forced and stilted - we know you're just reading lines. Rylance makes the language flow though and I can truly believe that this is authentic speech and that he really is sitting there trying to find the next word and then hilariously grumbuckling it up. I've always been a huge fan of classic children's literature and film, and I enjoyed it just as much as the little ones I went with did. ", "Dat score.

It's about a friendship, and it lets its characters just sit around and talk. It's a shame that it's financial prospects look rather grim.\n\n\nIt's a little long and there were some moments where the CGI is a bit wonky, but man I was absolutely enthralled. If I ever have kids I will definitely show them this, after reading the book with them of course.", "Lovely music, great acting, and just an all around uplifting movie. Not sure why reddit doesn't seem to be enjoying it as much as the other sites. 8/10 for me.\n", "[deleted]", "OK, I'll start by saying I disagree with a lot of you in here. First off, I wasn't a big fan of the Sophie character. From what I remember in the book, Sofie is a shy kid that doesn't have a lot of friends and tends to be very timid and unsure of herself. In this movie, Sophie has absolutely no arc. She starts out as a strong character that does chores after dark and ends the movie as the same character but with a new buddy. One of the things I loved about the book is that The BFG helps her gain confidence in herself. He shows her how to be independent and also shows her what true friendship is. Instead I always Felt like Sophie was annoyed at the BFG. I felt like she was being condescending to him the entire movie. I never got the impression that she found him to be a kindred spirit. They are supposed to be 2 outsiders among their respective peoples. But it felt more like school lessons the entire time.\n\nSecondly, The other giants. They just weren't scary enough. I never felt the tension from these giants because of how bumbling and/or stupid they were. Even Fleshlumpeater, voiced by Jemaine Clemment, felt too stupid to actually be a threat. I know its a movie for kids. I know you can't show these giants actually eating children, but I never got the sense that they were actually any kind of threat. Yeah I chuckled when the giants were roller skating on cars, but should I really be laughing at these child eating monsters? I should be terrified for Sophie's safety. \n\nLastly, I had no problem with the breakfast in the castle scene. I loved it. I laughed more during that part than any part of the movie. It was some fantastic physical, don't-need-too-many words type comedy. It felt like it was pulled straight from the book. The guards perplexed and confused faces, the Queen's motherly expressions and demeanor, THE BFG's table set-up. All of it was so fun to watch. All capped off by an admittedly low-brow but hilarious fart joke. \n\nI loved the BFG. He reminded me of my dad. Rylance killed that part and the CG was incredible. He was warm, and whimsical, and you could tell the difficult life he has had to lead. I felt for him. I desperately wanted him to have his peaceful life collecting dreams and trying to make the world a better place in his own magical way. The addition of the boy from his past was a bit of a shock. And it really added something to the BFG's character. The drawings in the boy's old bedroom were absolutely heartbreaking. I wish that scene would have taken place at another time in the movie. Instead it was placed in the middle of a very tense moment. There was a lot of exploring to do there but instead we just get a glimpse and then we have to get back to the giants bumbling around the dream shop. \n\nI know a lot of this sounds nitpicky , but I liked the movie overall. It just didn't quite live up to what I wanted from The BFG. \n\nTL:DR Sophie doesn't grow as a character, The Giants aren't very scary, I actually enjoyed the breakfast scene, The BFG was awesome, and his former friend broke my heart. ", "This movie was so slow paced and dull.\n\nIt had its moments, and both Rylance and Barnhill did very good jobs in their roles and had good chemistry. The animation was well handled and it did a good job building the land of the giants.\n\nBut it was so dull. I found myself losing focus constantly, which isn't typically a problem for me. I lost interest about halfway through the film and could barely bring myself to stay awake for the second half. The pacing was way too slow for me, especially for a kids movie. I don't think it will hold young children's attention at all and will test even the more patient older ones.\n\nThis isn't an attack on Spielberg, for it is overall a well done film. It just didn't quite connect and felt like they were really dragging to hit that 90 minute mark and then some. \n\nI'm a little disappointed because I had been excited for this film.", "You people hate every movie.", "If Mark Rylance isn't a household name in the near future I feel he'll have been done a serious disservice. The guy's one of my new favourite actors.", "As a fan of the book and the 80s animated film I was of course super excited for this film when I heard of it back in 2014. Going back even then I was concerned that despite both prior existing versions of the story ending with Sophie and the BFG sticking together that this film would follow the trope that the child is in a better place without their magical friend and they would go their separate ways, and it really sucks that I was correct. I need to see the movie again to make some more sense of the end, I want to believe that Sophie and the BFG still hang out often and just that he lives in Giant Country and she lives in the human world just because physically it works better for them, but in the moment it seemed more like she 'sees' him living happily in Giant Country and 'talks to him' more like a coping mechanism for missing him and that she doesn't actually have any direct interaction with him anymore. \n\nFrom the beginning of them film, I get the pacing was super wonky but I forgave it because that is kinda how it is throughout the book and 80s movie too, just the nature of the story. I was really enjoying the movie UNTIL Sophie caught a nightmare and it basically told the BFG that he will regret everything and can't undo it. He then basically tried to drop Sophie back at her orphanage thinking it was what was best for her.  Dude, she had a hard enough time trusting people and was just starting to open up a bit, and he freakin abandons her. And then she hops up on the ledge of her balcony and jumps!  I mean yeah he was there and he saved her, but what if he wasn't?! That was like a solid attempt at suicide holy shit that is dark!!! From that point on the rest of the movie just didn't sit well with me. \n\nThe last thing that really put a pit in my stomach was  when the red coat appeared and BFG's reaction. I was like ohhhhh shit, I sense some bad baggage, and then he explains that he had a human companion once, but he was unable to protect him and he was eaten by the other giants. Sophie asks if the boy was scared and the BFG says something like 'Not until the end.\"  It makes for an interesting side story, and I had always wondered what if the BFG had another human companion, but I always assumed it would be AFTER Sophie!  In the book and everything it was fully established Sophie was his first companion, but this part was added to the new film and it was just SO SAD! Q_Q\n\nI always believed the scary parts of this story were to come from the man eating giants, but in this adaptation I found them more as big bullies that offered comedy. To me, the real darkness came from the BFG's regretful past and current situation of, in my opinion, being an irresponsible guardian. \n\nI'm sure there is more I love about this film besides the art and Mark Rylance's performance, but I need to see the film again before I can figure all that out.

It felt like a \"tour\" of the book that just danced from scene to scene, focusing on bits and pieces while never really holding onto any of the substance the book had. Sophie and BFG's conversations were my favorite parts of the book and while there was plenty of dialogue between the two in the movie, it never really felt like they were having a meaningful conversation.\n\nMy biggest gripe however was the music. It wasn't bad music at all, actually quite the opposite and a beautiful score. But it never stopped. There was constantly a flighty and wondrous song playing in the background which both distracted me and rarely helped change my mood. There was one scene however that scared the shit out of me, which was the scene where Sophie stood on the balcony for the second time. Complete silence. And that was the only time I was nervous for the safety of the characters.\n\nAll that being said, the visuals were fantastic. Bright colors, awesome character design and realistic animation.

Some people may find the film uncomfortable but isn't that the point of the film? That the things society shames us into feeling uncomfortable about and hiding shouldn't make us feel ashamed. \n\nBut I also see Manny as being the part of Hank's psyche that society has taught him to hide or discard (like the trash Manny keeps referencing). As the film goes on Hank starts to love Manny and I see this as a possible symbol of Hank incorporating that previously rejected part of his psyche back into himself. Not only accepting it but recognizing how amazing it is, and coming to love it.\n\nI don't think it's coincidence that the scene where Hank kisses Manny is underwater and once they resurface he accepts that Manny makes him happy away from society's restrictions as water is often associated with rebirth. Not to mention that the literal resurfacing of the characters is also a symbol of the repressed and rejected part of Hank's psyche and personality that has resurfaced from his subconscious. \n\nWhen they finally get back to society Manny has been shamed into thinking he's disgusting because Hank has taught him everything that society teaches us and Hank says not to say that, which is sort of a symbol for Hank telling himself not to let society make him feel ashamed again. \n\nManny dies on the lawn, a sign that society starts trying to shame Hank into repressing that part of himself again. But when they try to take Manny's body he says he won't let them; A symbol for Hank not letting society squash that part of him again. And in the end Manny farts off into the ocean and Hank is happy because he doesn't need Manny anymore because he's incorporated that previously repressed part into himself now and accepts it. There are countless other examples of symbolism for accepting ones whole self throughout the movie but I've talked long enough. I definitely recommend  this film. Some people may think it's too weird for them, but I think maybe  they're the ones who need it's message most.\n", "They got me for a second at the end when they referred to Paul Dano as Manny. ", "Who would have thought my favorite romantic movie of the year would have been between Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe ", "Loved it. I think Mary Elizabeth Winstead's last line in the movie perfectly summed it up.", "I know it's a minor point but I'm glad the movie ultimately acknowledges that taking pictures of random girls on the bus isn't sensitive and romantic but is instead actually super creepy.", "I brought my brother to this, and he hadn't seen a single trailer and didn't know the premise. He was very confused.", "So can anyone tell me what the camera man was talking about when he said he thought he'd seen Hank before?", "Alright I'm gonna try and put my thoughts together on this incredibly strange film:\n\nAs I understood it, the movie is about a guy with an extremely unhealthy obsession with a girl. He never had the social skills needed to succeed in the world as it exists today, and he was always too self conscious to try and make a change. He leaves behind a life that in his mind wasn't worth living in the first place, and starts living in the woods behind her house. He basically doesn't understand how or why people could enjoy being in their bodies, living the lives that they live every day, when there are so many things you have to worry about NOT doing. He probably suffers from severe anxiety.\n\nBecause he feels that he doesn't belong in the modern world, he imagines himself as a cast away on a tiny island surrounded by water, kind of like how he's on his own little metaphorical island with no way of communicating with the people around him. He is ashamed of his obsession with a girl he knows he can never actually get, but he is too in love with her to physically separate himself. So instead he lives in the woods by her house. Close enough physically that his obsession is maintained, but as far away mentally as possible.\n\nThe body washing up on shore is real, but I think Manny is dead the entire time and the events that happen in the movie mostly happen in Hank's head. Basically, Hank teaching Manny about life is his own way of teaching himself how to navigate the complex societal norms of a world he has never fully understood. Everyone always says that the only time you can say you actually understand a concept is when you can teach it to someone else. In Hank's mind, he teaches himself how the world works by imagining that he's teaching Manny - this simplistic and essentially \"empty\" vessel that asks all the questions Hank (and us the audience) think but are too afraid to ask, especially about taboo topics like bodily functions.\n\nAs Hank successfully grapples with and understands all these societal norms, Manny becomes more and more \"alive\" and helps Hank navigate back to the real world. The cell phone getting reception is also probably in Hank's own mind, and symbolizes how close/far he is mentally from civilization.\n\nAs Hank slowly learns how the world works, he uses Manny to play out how his ideal life would unfold, if he had all these societal skills when he first saw the girl on the bus. Because he's still ashamed of his love for a woman who is clearly taken, he has Manny play his role, while he pretends to be the girl.\n\nWhile all this unfolds, he also realizes from Manny that there is no need to be so ashamed of certain things. There are a lot of things people view negatively with no real explanation as to why they are bad. This also helps Hank grow as a person because it helps him confront his shame and come to terms with the fact that everybody does embarrassing things, and it doesn't define you as a person.\nManny \"dying\" once they get back to civilization is partly due to the audience being reintroduced to the \"real\" world, and partly due to Hank regressing to his original ashamed self, unable to talk and repressing all of the freedom that Manny embodies. Hank betrays this mutual reliance that they both have developed (Hank teaches Manny about how to behave in public, and Manny teaches Hank how to accept his faults) so Manny \"dies\" and now we see that the body was always dead, and everyone else sees a delusional man who claims this corpse has been alive all along.\n\nThe ending is kind of a tongue-in-cheek way of reiterating what the entire movie is about - owning up to your weirdness and accepting it as a part of your life, rather than repressing it. The directors want us as the audience to think \"what the fuck?\" the same way we would if a grown man just walked up to us and farted really loudly. I guess it's their way of practicing what they preach. Like, \"yes there is a traditional way to end movies like this. But fuck it, we're going to fart instead\"\n\nIncredibly shot, amazing score, and one of the most unique stories to come out this year. It's a solid 8/10, with two points deducted mostly for accessibility. This isn't a movie I would recommend everyone go see, sadly. You need a certain sense of humor to enjoy it. I can completely understand why a lot of people absolutely hated it.", "Beautiful movie. Having watched some of Daniels' other things, I've noticed a common theme of magic (or fantastical things) being weird and gross and freaking people out while still being real.\n\nMy two favorite sections were when the relationship roleplaying intensified (the bus and party especially) and then at the end when we saw Hank through everyone else's perspective, while still believing in what he'd experienced somehow.\n\nThis felt like a weird fairytale for adults about loneliness. 10/10 for anyone willing to suspend disbelief and give into the weirdness.", "I honestly don't know how to explain my thoughts on the movie.\n\nI liked it. I loved how unique it was. I loved the ending having a kind of fake out moment where you weren't sure what was real. The farting went from funny to stupid to endearing which was a weird trajectory. Dano and Radcliffe were awesome. Dano made too convincing of a Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It was just a very endearing movie and was off the wall and showed me just why indie cinema will never really die. No major studio would touch this film, and I'm happy to see it get made.", "Something I haven't seen discussed much in reviews of this film:\nIf you are aware of Daniels previous work at all [Interesting Ball for example](https://vimeo.com/110808221) , you may pick up on something about them that I truly respect.\n\nThey have an amazing understanding of \"cliche\" in filmmaking. What I mean by that is that basically filmmakers/films constantly recycle certain techniques that can be used to easily trigger an emotional response within an audience. Usually this is done through things like score, performance, and camera technique. Two simple examples of this: Epic score, slow motion shots, someone screaming violently as they run -- We are pumped for this amazing battle scene. Or: Sad piano music, intense close ups, whispers -- We should care about this person dying.\n\nDaniels understanding of these cliches is something that they use to their advantage in what I will dub the \"Emotionally Heavy\" scenes within their work. Here is what they do in their own use of cliche:\n\n-- Score: They often use intense, sweeping, overwhelming scoring, that is usually reserved for more \"intense\" films. Something you would normally hear in a Gladiator, an Inception, a Transformers, or at the end of a documentary intended to blow your god damn mind at how vast the universe is.\n-- Acting: The intense, exaggerated, and almost heavy handed performances (not in a bad way mind you) are obviously encouraged by them, especially in relation to emotional beats and scenes that they know pack a punch.\n-- The Camera: They are very visual directors, and are aware of the type of framing, technique, and style of cinematography that is used which is associated with epic/intense -- Slow motion, sweeping pans, crazy camera moves.\n\nBut here's what makes what they do interesting: They can replicate film cliche so well, they have found a way to transcend it and make it wholly original. They do this by applying these techniques to ridiculous scenarios, situations, or subject matter that is usually not reserved for such intensity. Thus, making something that shouldn't be handled so epically/intensely/sadly, cranked up to 11. And that juxtaposition, the collision of well known cliches with non-cliche subject matter, messes with our expectations in a brilliant way.\n\nThe ending of the film is a brilliant example of this. We are treated to an \"epic ending\" cliche. It's almost superhero like in fashion, i.e. this Spider-Man ending -- [Tobey McGuire flying through the city with helicopters towards the sunset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erJFUS9ZYmQ) But when this technique is applied to a scene where a corpse comes back to life, and farts off into the sunset happily -- some of us can't handle what is happening, and some of us get excited about filmmaking again... But, I guess that's just my opinion, man.", "If you don't know Jurassic Park, you don't know shit. ", "Mary Elizabeth Winstead at the end made this movie perfect. Her delivery of \"What the fuck?!\" outdoes the one in The Guest.", "This movie spoke to me in some heavy ways. I think the hardest part was when they were on the \"bus\" and manny was just so excited to see things out the window, talk to people, sing songs, and Hank was just like, \"no the bus sucks, nobody sings, we don't socialize.\" It really made me think about how alone so many of us feel, and how much we do it to ourselves.", "This soundtrack makes me swoon.", "I saw this movie last night with a few friends. I was looking forward to this because I'd never seen a trailer even remotely similar to this one. This movie is hilarious right from the start but as time goes by, the movie becomes a showcase for what it means to be human and how crippling human emotions can be. There were multiple times where I almost cried even though there was farting ten seconds prior. The regret that Hank lived with and the simple way that Manny saw his complex emotions were heartbreaking at times, making me wish that it was that easy to breakdown such emotions. This movie has a doubleness that most movies fail to achieve and it was all possible because of the stellar acting by both Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. ", "Everybody needs to check out the lyrics for the Montage music.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fh8qNRp55rQ", "First and foremost, I loved this movie. I feel it had a very heart-warming tone for the first 2/3 of the movie. It was pretty amazing considering the fact that most of the dialogue focuses on masturbation and farts. It has this great way of exposing what makes us human and informing us that we are all kind of weird and that's makes everything ok. \n\n\nI'm not really seeing the discussion about the ending I'd expect here. I felt the ending is very open to interpretation. I see people saying that the end confirmed the fantastical elements, and I'm not quite so sure. I feel the story actually isn't fixed one way or the other and wants us to decide based on how we view the story. Our main character just so happens to wander in the backyard of the girl he's obsessed with. Everything he built is just outside her home. He was never far off. The island he was trying to hang himself at looks a lot like the beach at the end. He very likely could be a stalker/murderer and we have viewed this entire story through his deranged perspective. \n\n\nThe moment Manny farts at the very end could also be the main character hallucinating. Why would he be able to hallucinate alone or front of the little girl but not in front of anyone else? I think the ending has two options. One is an optimistic road where we believe these fantastic things happened, and the other one is a harder pill to swallow because we just shared these very joyful experiences with someone who might be very deranged. ", "Can we talk about how this film shits all over the whole Manic Pixie Dream girl?\n\nThey build Sarah up to be this amazing force that pulls them towards safety. Yet when they find her, she's not a MPDG at all. \n\nThe interpretation is: I can't save you, you have to save you. Oh you like me, well I don't actually owe you anything and I have my own thing going on here. Your expectation and idealization of me doesn't define me. \n\nIt's so delightfully subversive in that way (and a gazillion other ways.) ", "The movie was quite.... artsy-fartsy.", "However you felt about the movie, I don't think anyone can deny the soundtrack was amazing", "Did anybody else catch fucking Shane Carruth as one of the news people??\n\n\nEDIT: *Coroner ", "There are a lot of comments here suggesting that Hank is crazy, or was hallucinating Manny.\n\nMust we rationalize everything? Can't we just have a weird movie where Daniel Radcliffe plays a farting corpse who becomes Paul Dano's best friend without having to subject it to the rigidity of reality?", "First of all, loved the movie. Second, was there a fart right before the A24 logo came up at the beginning or was someone in my theater being funny? Either way it was a great way to start the film. Third, as soon as the credits rolled, the guy next to me said, \"What the fuck?\" Perfect way to describe it. \n\nAll in all this was everything I was hoping for and the audience I saw it with was great too. ", "Best movie of the year by far for me.  Movie explored a lot of deep and personal issues that I think a lot of people deal with but never talk about; loneliness, falling in love and becoming obsessed with a girl you've never met, holding onto that belief that life can get better somehow even when you want to kill yourself, having insecurities about everything (farting, going to the bathroom, being alone with no one in life, self esteem issues etc.)\n\nDope soundtrack as well.  Been listening to it on Spotify since I saw it last night.", "This is the freshest thing I've seen in a long time. I think it will stick with me too, and I'm sure it will have a cult following in years to come.\n\nI think it overturns viewers' assumptions that 1) characters/plot points have to make sense to be meaningful and that 2) a story arc has to meet expectations and resolve realistically. \n\nMovies are above all else entertainment - they don't have to scratch your every itch in the exact way you expect. They don't have to fit snugly into a single category. Most of the magic stuff that happens on screen works for some reason that can't quite be described or defined.\n\nAlso I'll say this: this movie's bear scene was better than the one in The Revenant.", "I loved this movie.  It put a smile on my face that won't go away. It was hilarious at moments,  really profound at others, emotional at some points,  and overall just crazy.  It made me laugh, it made me feel, and it made me think about life in general.  Daniel Radcliffe was spectacular and so was Paul Dano, there chemistry was amazing. The directing was amazing.  The score was so memorable and happy.  Would recommend to others. I'd give it an 8.5/10. \n\nIt was the happiest movie about loneliness that I've ever seen!", "I enjoyed it even more than I thought I would. I love that independent companies can cover ground like this that big studios would never touch. \n\nI don't know how to explain to people that it's not good *because* of the farting nor is it good *in spite* of it. It's just a necessary piece of the overall artwork, I guess. \n\nAlso, my husband is trying to argue that this would not be a great film to show our future children to teach them the facts of life, but I'm still not convinced. So much ground covered in such a short time.", "This better get nominated for Best Original Score.", "Can we talk about the ending? My husband and I are totally disagreeing on how to interpret it.\n\nFor me it didn't feel that open to interpretation. I realize that film (and art in general) is entirely subject to the audience's interpretation, but assigning meaning that just isn't there (reaching for meaning, assigning value to an interaction that doesn't hold firm) doesn't do it for me. I saw the ending as confirmation of Manny's Super Corpse Powers, kind of an \"I TOLD you I'm not crazy!\" moment for Hank, while the range of reactions from the bystanders reflected the range of reactions to audiences.\n\nMy husband saw the ending -- again, specifically due to the range of reactions from the bystanders when Manny jets off to sea -- as confirmation that Hank was actually insane/having a psychotic break/hallucinating everything, and that we were essentially seeing the last few minutes from Hank's perspective.\n\nDid anybody else see it that way? Was Hank REALLY just a crazy, suicidal man looking for meaning?\n\n", "Beautiful, brilliant, endearing, heartbreaking, hilarious, weird, exhilarating, *and* a chance to finally see a Free Fire trailer. \n\n10/10. Get your gassy ass to the theater. ", "A castaway returns home riding on the back of a farting corpse like a jetski. It doesn't seem like the proper setup for a moving existentialist meditation on fear and loneliness, but it somehow works.", "I think this film just reaffirms that there's a little magic in the world if we're just open to seeing and accepting it. In the beginning of the film when we see the little \"help me\" vessels Hank made, you can spot on one of them something along the lines of \"my boat crashed...,\" which makes me wary of the madman living in the woods interpretation. \n\nWhile this movie was outstanding and refreshingly unique, the one scene that actually made me GASP was when Hank and Manny were on the bus in the woods and there was a close up of Hank's face that was beautifully backlit.

Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. A ridiculous premise. A24 releasing it. Great reception at Sundance. But with all that said, I went into it a little reserved. A little cautiously optimistic. I thought \"yeah, this movie will probably be a fun time, but nothing top 10 worthy. Nothing substantial.\" Boy was I wrong.\n\n To say this movie is simply an absurd, slapstick comedy that revolves around a farting corpse, would be such a disservice to this film. I was blown away by how much depth, how much heart, and how much emotion was packed into this thing. This is truly a coming of age story, and you can see Paul Dano grow, and come to many self realizations about life, love, companionship, friendship, and happiness. Sure, it has some extremely ridiculous, over the top, physical comedy. But to judge this movie solely on that is unfair. \n\nI don't want to get too into everything that happens, but if you've seen the trailer, and it interests you at all...go see this. You will be very much surprised. It's kind of like a Pixar film in their golden days. A movie that is cute and fun on the surface, but offers so much more.\nPerfect 5/5, A+ for me.", "Brilliant. Just watching that final scene with Sara saying \"what the fuck?\" summed up everything I loved about the movie. So bizarre but so refreshingly creative and charming.

I feel like the end really sums up all the emotions I felt during the movie.

So weird and funny and touching.", "Before I share my thoughts I'd just like to say that I absolutely hate \"art films\", films where characters exist only to serve the morals or ideals of the story, where the events occurring are an effect of emotions that can be interpreted in multiple ways, they're fairy tales. I prefer stricter rational stories. \n\n\nI enjoyed this film, but lastly because of the story. It's the amazing music, direction and acting that make this film stand out. \n\n\nMy personal interpretation of the events in the film are as follows, Hank is lonely introverted guy who is infatuated and stalks a girl who rides the same bus as him. His father was emotionally distant, and he lost his mother, who he was much closer to died when he we a young child. Never having an emotional bond since he has a mental breakdown, fed up with his fear of opening up to people and how it has prevented him from connecting to people. He runs off to the woods to kill himself when he comes across Manny's dead body, who committed suicide like he was just about to do. And then he second thoughts about the whole thing and tries to fix himself the only way he understands how.\n\n\nLike he does with Sarah and the rest of his life, Hank imagines Manny as the perfect person, trying to fill the void and emptiness that he feels. Hank hates himself so he imagines him to be someone who is everything that he's not, everything he wants to be, Manny isn't self conscious or afraid of his body or his thoughts, the opposite extreme. Because Hank has repressed all of his feelings and emotions, he decides to relive them in order to try to move past them, this time acting out his fantasies as Sarah. He imagines the perfect life between the person  that he wants to be and the person he wants to be with, but Manny is nothing like Hank, and Hank is nothing like Sarah. Him on the pipe crossing the river is the visualization of his compounding fear as he attempts to reintegrate with society, he hides his feelings again which ends with him hanging from a noose again, and he is saved by embracing Manny completely. He wants to remain in this new fantasy world but he's still obsessed with Sarah, he still idealizes what she represents and still yearns for real connection. So he tries to integrate back to society, but his fear returns and he abandons the ideals that he learned from Manny when he realizes that they don't work either, the idea of Manny is dead so we see him as being dead. Hank hides further pretending to be someone else to hide his shameful demented actions, he lets his father believe him to be dead and watches him suffer so that he can finally see some sort of emotion out of him. It all collapses in on him and the result of his pent up emotions is on display for all to see. On the beach he is given the choice to take responsibility for is actions and emotions and he reclaims the ideals of Manny and that's visualized by his farting away in the ocean and his father's uncharacteristic laughter. He is free.\n\n\n But Manny was never the answer, Hank thought that living completely unhinged and free may have made him happier, but he still would be an outcast to society. Hank represents the shame and fear that manifests as a result of our culture and societal norms, it broke him and he poses a danger to the society that made him that way. If we didn't see this story from his perspective then we wouldn't sympathize with him at all, his actions cannot be justified in anyway, Sarah's daughter is probably scarred for life.\n\n\nSo basically crazy stalker dude goes out to the woods to commit suicide, finds dead body and goes crazier, uses the dead body live out his fantasies, gets attacked by a bear, scares the bear off by being crazy, goes to the house of the woman he's stalking and shows her daughter a dead body, cops and cameras arrive, pretends the dead body is him and watches his dad cry, people find out he's crazy so he runs off with the dead body, cops arrest him on the beach, he poops his pants, the end.\n\n\nWhat I would particularly commend the film for is the twist ending, that he was never really stuck on a deserted island. I expected a twist but assumed it would be something simpler like he was dead the whole time or something.\n\n\nMental illness is a difficult subject to tackle, and Swiss Army Man does so very well. This film has many similarities to The Voices, It's about a similarly insane dude who talks to things that shouldn't be talking, although in that movie it is made clear what's real and what isn't.", "Today was my 17th birthday and it was the first rated R movie I bought a ticket for.

When Hank makes a story out of thin air about \"Jessie\", the girl in the magazine, this parallels the story with Sarah. Both the swimsuit model and Sarah are wearing yellow. Hank has given this person a personality in his mind, and thinks about dating her and living with her.\n\n* In my opinion, the whole film takes place inside Hank's head. Many quick cuts show whole scenes mashing together. The whole movie is like a montage taking place inside Hank's head. He provides the soundtrack to the film, which he sings out loud throughout the movie.\nHank is completely insane and has possibly done something like this before \u2013 he is recognised by the news cameraman near the end of the film. Maybe he has ran away from the police/an asylum? He seems to be obsessed with Sarah, a girl he saw on the bus. The forest where Hank and Manny explore is literally walking distance from her home.\n\n* When the ambulance/police arrive, one cop mentions that Manny was a 'bridge-jumper', meaning that he possibly committed suicide as well. His real self might've also been so discontent with the world that he decided to kill himself. Manny is completely open about his flatulence feelings, emotions and thoughts. He is alive on the inside while dead on the outside \u2013 and Hank is the opposite.\n\n* At the end of the film, Hank whispers something into Manny's ear before sending him off into the water. I found the ending quite depressing, since it can either represent: a) Hank no longer needing Manny's help/he has become more free *OR* b) Hank sending that part of him away into the horizon, being hidden yet again from the world.\n\n*In conclusion, I feel like a literal summary of the movie is: An insane man finds enlightenment by learning to love the so-called \"ugly\" side of himself. He finds a body on the shore of a man who killed himself, and he envisions himself learning about life and how precious it is to those who are dead. He is a \"freak\" in a world where he knows that he doesn't belong. He loves a girl but he cannot tell her how he feels since he is so hopeless and antisocial. He journeys home after learning about life and the other side of himself, only to have it literally murdered by societal rules. When on the beach at the ending, he lets go of that side of himself and has to hide it away.\n\nthanks guys, this was literally thrown together in 5 min.", "Without a doubt one of my favourite films of the year.

And there's Swiss Army Man about a guy who befriends a corpse whose penis is a compass. Guys...this movie is incredible. It really has a lot going for it. Paul Dano is very endearing and holds a lot of the weight but boy is Radcliffe game for every crazy thing he has to do. Their friendship was really earnest to the point it was easy to forget just how juvenile the film was in a lot of ways. Still that juvenilia mixed with earnest sentiment really worked. I appreciated that Hank doesn't get the girl but does get to show what he's accomplished and how he's changed.

Why did Hank's dad think he was dead in the body bag?\n\nPersonally, I'm under the impression that Hank was simply a crazy dude living in the woods who stumbled upon a corpse. He thinks back on his life and how he never struck up a conversation with Sarah (which is the epitome of his life not fully lived) and decides to go for it.

Surprised that none of the reviews I've read so far picked up on this, but it was super clear to me that the shark represented her unprocessed grief for her mother. I tend to take a psychological approach to most movies, but I find horror movies are often about repressed emotions (lust, grief, anger etc.) and this one worked GREAT in that way. When we find Nancy with the gash in her leg stranded on the rock, that's essentially where she was at in the beginning of the film psychologically: wounded, isolated, in pain. As she goes through the film, she's forced to confront the shark, her unprocessed grief, directly. The marketing caption for the posters is \"What was once in the deep, is now in the shallows.\" I think this means that when she got her \"alone time\" the grief buried deep within her came to the surface and she had to battle it with all her resources.

I think the \"You gotta fight like your mom did\" stuff would have been a lot more effective without the epilogue. The cut to black at the end should have been the end of the movie.

Another thing to add is that this isn\u2019t a single character piece like \u2018Locke\u2019; there are other players at work including a seagull, believe it or not. Yes you read correctly; a seagull, who damn near steals the movie.

Not even ten minutes later she has the cheesiest sob convo with her dad about her mother's passing and how she no longer cares about her career or future because in life,fighting is pointless because mom fought and look what happened to her. Lame. The shark was disappointing, it wasn't literally Sharknado cgi bad but it was a definite let down. As for Blake, well she tried. She really really did, and I applaud her. But the truth is that as of right now she's simply not an elite actress. A lot of us were excited to see if she could prove herself by carrying this whole movie alone and possibly turn her career into a more serious direction, but that didn't happen.

Risking your life to grab a GoPro? The CGI was pretty terrible too, in all honesty. And that shark would have EASILY bit her leg off considering how we saw how big it's mouth was multiple times. I'm really shocked it's doing as well as it is critically. Very B-movieesque at times. As nice as Blake Lively is to look at, all the gratuity shots really took me out of the moment.

Went to high school with one of Newt's and Rachel's descendants. Much of the movie was actually filmed in Lousiana so didn't look exactly right for Mississippi. I liked the movie. \n\nI enjoyed the flash forwards, as the man in those scenes must've been my HS friend's granddad. \n\nThis story isn't meant to be any kind of comprehensive Civil War story. It's Newt's story and as such I thought it worked. I'd love to know more about other characters' stories as well. I'm going to have to read up on this. My mom gave me a book on the subject a couple years ago but I haven't read it yet. ", "So, I've been pretty bummed out with the reviews this movie has gotten. Some background on me. I was born and raised just south of Jones County, near Hattiesburg. My ancestors were members of the Knight Company. My grandfather had a book that contained a roster of all of the members of the Company. My aunt still has this book. It is absurdly old. I've grown up with the story of Newt Knight all of my life. Everyone talks about, \"heading over to the Free State of Jones,\" when they go through Ellisville. These events really happened. There are still Knights around here who look like Davis in the \"85 Years Later\" scenes. The rednecks who still wave the confederate battle flag like to talk about how Newt was a traitor and a scumbag. He's not universally considered a local hero or anything. \n\nAnyway, this movie is very much local history to me. So, to see reviewers or movie goers criticize this film as some White Savior propaganda piece is ridiculous. I think the problem viewers have with the storyline is that it goes against their (incorrect) viewpoint that the South was and is monolithic, that we're all inbred bigots who scream, \"The South's gon' rise again!\" And to see a true story of a group of people who actively fought against that notion, just throws their worldview for a loop, and they don't want to have to question their bias towards the South and Southerners. \n\nNow, if you want to critique the film on pacing, I can respect that. It moved weirdly in places, the flash forwards gave away Newt and Rachel's relationship before they really even met on screen. The third act was slow and difficult to watch, but I think that's a result of trying to maintain historical accuracy, and to show how freedmen weren't really any better off during Reconstruction. Newt's speeches were powerful though, and shed light on how much class divides the nation almost as much as race. If you were too poor to own slaves, it wasn't your fight. Why die for a cause you didn't believe in and could gain no benefit from? Every Southerner was not pro-Confederacy. \n\nI loved the movie, as heavy as it was, maybe more than some because of how interwoven the story is to my own past and to this area. It wasn't a perfect film, but I thought it was a lot better than it's being rated. ", "My thoughts:\n\n\nTrailer I saw had made it seem more like an action film set during the Civil War, with a rag tag group of Southerners rebelling against the Confederacy. That was maybe half of the movie, but only 15 minutes or so had action.\n\n\nVery bloody, very dark. I understand that's accurate for the time period in the South, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite so heavy and to leave the theater depressed and sad about how horrible people can be.\n\n\nThe flash forwards 85 years seemed strange and unnecessary. At first, they also kind of spoiled Newt's relationship with Rachel.\n\n\nDid they shoot this in 60 frames per second? It had that high-frame rate more, HDTV look to it. Very distracting at times.\n\n\nPacing was all over the place. Ended at an odd and unsatisfying point. It kind of reminded me of the movie The Postman, and not in a good way.\n\n\nIf they were going to explore Reconstruction, I think they could have done a better job, rather than jumping forward and using text to catch us up on check-ins with Newt and Moses. (I get what they were actually trying to show, that after the war nothing has really changed for the better, and that the Free State of Jones was superior to Reconstruction-era Mississippi).\n\n\nDid I mention how depressing the last third of the film was?\n\n\nI'd like to think the original idea was for it to be like Reign of Fire but set during the Civil War, and instead of fighting dragons, McConaughey was fighting racism, wielding a proverbial axe of equality as he charges at the Confederacy.\n\n\nAlso, was that photo at the end credits the real Newt? Because he did look a lot like Matthew McConaughey.\n\n\nBonus question: Am I the only person on /r/movies who woke up on a beautiful Summer Friday and said \"I'm going to go to the movies and see the very first showing of the Free State of Jones?\" There were maybe 20 other people in theater, but everyone else was very, very old.", "based on the number of comments here, i think no one saw the film", "Just got back from seeing this.

There were maybe 20 people in the theatre, most of them old people.\n\nI loved the movie. MicHooney did a great job at making you sympathize with a deserter, something I imagine would be difficult to achieve. It was very gorey and emotional and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The one thing I didn't like was the weird flash forwards. It really ruined the pacing. There had to be a better way to tell that story.", "I don't know why it's getting such mediocre reviews. I thought it was decent. I especially liked the character of Moses. ", "It's a very brutal and dark story. The critics pulling a SJW hissy fit because it dares to show a white guy being nice to black people is just effing ridiculous.\n\nThe acting's superb, the screenplay follows an incredibly complicated story during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Maybe the movie should have been longer in fact as the last half telescopes too many events that deserve to be studied in their own right. Probably essential to have an interest in American history, but if you do this is the most realistic and best film ever made about that bloody war. And this is the first time I've seen a movie examine Reconstruction and everything that went wrong, leaving African Americans at as much risk as when they were enslaved.", "I am going to have to think about this movie for a few days, as I walked out feeling absolutely weighed down. But it's hard for me to tell if it was the content that weighed heavy on me, or if the film was just not good, and the \"weight\" was really disappointment. For now though, I'm comfortable saying this: this isn't a happy, feel-good, redemption film. Don't go into this expecting *The Patriot* set in the Civil War. There is no great vindication moment where you feel our protagonist not only succeeded but also *vanquished* his enemies. Apart from maybe two 'battles,' there is no great final moment of victory. Not in this film, and not for this story they chose to tell. So you're probably going to be left exhausted and more than a little weary of what you just witnessed.  Oh, and don't go into this expecting a fast-paced, battle-heavy war film! There are a few solid fights (maybe three?), but they are hardly the focal point of the film. \n\nWhat you'll see is America during one of its darkest hours, in the rural back country of the South. And it's ugly. *Really* ugly. Frankly, to me, this was probably one of the most realistic depictions of the rural South during the mid-1800s. And while I think there are many, many people who would be ready and willing to see that kind of film, that's not how the film was advertised/marketed. \n\nI'm currently on the fence about the 85+ years later segments. I am sure it could have been handled better, but I actually think it was actually a pretty important aspect of the story of Newton: he didn't win. He did what little could, in his little corner of the world, but a toxic desire to depreciate the value and dignity of others won out when it came to him and his family. That 85 years later people *still* cared that a man had any African American blood in him, enough so to hold an entire fucking jury trial on it to say whether or not he was improperly wedded, is absolutely ridiculous. His case being remanded to avoid Supreme Court scrutiny wasn't a win. It was temporary appeasement, like leaving Newton's family alone was, when he and Rachel decided to stay. How utterly miserable an existence that must have been for them during this time. Yes, they had each other. But they had no country. Not really. Free State of Jones is more of a state of mind, a lie--a dream perhaps--that the Freedmen, Newton, Rachel, and other poor folks had to tell themselves in order to just make it through the shit-show that was the Civil War, Reconstruction, and Martial Law. And for that, I appreciate the film for showing me. \n\nOkay, that being said, there were things I didn't care for: \n\n1) I went in expecting a slightly faster paced film, but that hope was dashed when the film indicates that the events that are about to be covered were from 1862-1875 (could be off a year). And boy do you feel those years... \n\n2) This will NOT provide you with many key historical moments going on in a regional or national level. There are some, but since this isn't a \"war film,\" folks who love references to major battles or events will feel kinda blind in someway. I feel awful for disliking this disoriented aspect of the film, but the folks in the swamp were probably completely out of the loop as to what was going on with the Union advancements. But it is what it is. The end of the war was sudden, and all you have is a kid whispering it to Newton and some music playing over his reaction. That's is. That's pretty much the standard treatment all major events (military wise) are given in the film lol.)\n\n3) So, you're told we are going to cover a LOT of years in the mid 1800s. Well out of the blue we are transported to a court room 85 years later, in the middle of a miscegenation trial of what probably was one of Newton's descendants. As another person mentioned, they totally ruined two plot points that hadn't worked themselves out yet. This *really* took away from the impact those two points could have had in the narrative. :(\n\nAnywho, those were my biggest gripes. I didn't mind the camera work or the editing as much as most people. And I did not mind Newton's speech in the swamp. In fact, it was really powerful to me for some reason.  But I'll give it a few days to see if I change my mind about the film, but for now I am happy I saw it. **6.5/10**", "Don't really agree with all the negative reviews this movies getting. It wasnt super great but it was still pretty good and illustrated the time and the problems that came with it very well. ", "I see a lot of complaints about the pacing of the movie. For me, I think the pacing was fine for the first hour and fifteen minutes or so. When the war began wrapping up, and after they took Ellisberg (or whatever town it was), it felt like a typical Hollywood climax. However, due to not ending the story there, the pacing then took a dive as the remaining 30-45 minutes covered several moments in time after the war that all felt a little disjointed.\n\nI understand the point being made once these scene began, after all, that is a very important point: the Civil War ending did not make these men \"free\" in the eyes of the Confederates. That's a great theme to cover, however, the way they did it could have used some work\n\nMy wife theorizes that the poor pacing was intentional. As the movie slugged on, it made you feel the way that all of the men in the Free State of Jones felt-- like this problem was not resolved and there was another fight.\n\nFinal note: I'm a Pastor. I ABSOLUTELY love the interchange between Newt and Moses:\n\nNewt: \"Mr. Moses, are you a n****er?\"\nMoses: No I am not, Cap\nNewt: And why is that?\nMoses: Because you can't own a child of God\n\nGood stuff", "I ended up really kind of hating this movie. \n\nI went in excited too. Civil war era movies are my bread and butter. McConaughey is on the top of his game. Other actors have been pretty good lately too. A good story, slave and confederate soldier revolt, sounds amazing.\n\nBut then it was all over the place. As /u/Zack_Sabbath said, pacing was pretty shit for this film. The entire last 30 minutes or whenever, post Civil War just dragged on. The film makers seemed like they had no idea how to end the movie, so they gave us scene after scene of ...shrug. Just misery and how life still sucked I guess. \n\nI was so shocked the first time we got an \"85 year later\" scene, and after it I groaned every time we went back. That added nothing to the movie and kept adding to the already bad pacing issues. I think someone should be fired for including that idea. \n\nI don't know if Moses was a real person in Newton's life, but in this film, he served as a way to basically speak for all slavery issues and be this perfect example of a man who just wanted to be free (outside of the whipping/master relationship they gave to Rachel). Hell, I don't know the names of anyone else in the initial camp, as they certainly didn't even have a voice. It was obvious early on they were going to have him killed at some point, especially when they miraculously reunited him with his wife and kid who were somewhere in Texas and managed to find out where he was hiding.\n\nThe speech Newton gave to rally his mini-army, basically saying they were all slaves to someone (with more colorful language of course) was incredibly awkward and just didn't feel right at all. It is like the film was implying that the poor white Southerners had it just as bad as the slaves, but then went on to constantly show that wasn't the case.\n\nThe \"bad guys\" in the movies are basically cartoon villains, except they never twirl their mustaches. The Lieutenant and Colonel have cheesy dialogue and just get bamboozled left and right. Then that peanut guy in the last act felt almost insulting to have those extreme peanut shell piles to make sure you understood. Showing us the pile at the voting booth was basically an insult to our intelligence, making sure we *got* it. \n\nI really hope The Birth of a Nation is a much better film, because this one left such a gross taste in my mouth. I explain it in a bit more detail on my full review, if you want to [see it here](http://gorgview.com/free-state-of-jones) :).

The cinematography is breathtaking. Even for Refn. The \"show\" in the club might be one of the best things I've ever seen set to film. Period. \n\nI really enjoyed how this film was paced as well. The first half, we'll say to the runway scene, is paced like a fairly standard film.... but after that scene, the whole thing changed. \n\nIn the first half, there is actually some character development. It's shallow, just like the characters in the film, but it seems to be a very clear artistic choice. Excluding Ruby that is, but more on that later. The direction is very showy and gorgeous, and features lots of color to highlight undertones in the mood. Jessie is a bright eyed girl, she's not cocky but confident.\n\nHowever, during the Runway scene, she seems to go into some sort of Trance. Perhaps it marks the point of the \"dream\" begining, or the point where it all becomes metaphorical. \n\nSee, after that scene, all of the characters become caricatures. I haven't been able to quite put my finger on it yet, but each character sort of becomes *something* rather than *someone* (hypothetical example: Ruby is Lust). Mid development, every character jumps to the hypothetical conclusion of what they will eventually become. To me, the ending is Refn's way of showing what happens to these characters as they progress in their career. But instead of choosing to make it occur over the standard life's period of time, he makes the jump happen immediately after the Runway scene in order to explore the hypotheticals of their choices. \n\nAnother thing that struck me after that scene was the stark shift in cinematography. After this scene, Refn begins to use much more natural lighting. He uses more deep space as well. The neon has faded, and so has the facade of the characters. They are in their \"final form\" so to speak, so consumed with own vanity and pride it leads them to... well you know the end. \n\nI think this all ties back into the title. The *Neon Demon*. Well, let\u2019s think about it for a bit. It's alluring. It's provocative. You hear ist and you say, \"Oh?\u201d. A Neon Demon, it glows, it shines, and it\u2019s beautiful. It draws you in through the imagery. But still, the two words are very shallow. You know what to expect, despite the incredibly lush description. \nSo in the beginning, we have gorgeous mediums stuffed with bright Neon, black, and white. The characters are semi realistic, the plot adheres to Hollywood structure, and it progresses at a reasonable pace. We'll call this the \"Neon\" half. This part is Refn waving his hands around, \"Look at me fuckers, looks at this incredible direction\". It's showy, and rightfully so. Its fucking gorgeous. It draws you in. Just like the modeling world draws women in, with its allure of beauty.\n\nAfter the \"half\", we have long, deep, natural spaces. The pace hits mach five, the violence...yeah that happens, and the whole thing goes Mulholland Drive. We'll call this the \"Demon\" half. Just like the phrase \"Neon Demon\", after the word Neon the film skips straight to the Demon. There is no transition, it just happens in two very specific moments; The Neon ends at the Runway scene (as discussed above) and the Demon begins when the girl next door is Raped?/Murdered. There's is a very specific visual motif in this scene. Jessie hugs a circle of light as the camera pulls away. Knowing Refn, he has quite the fascination of Maternity and the Womb (OGF's most fucked up scene for starters). I believe that the circle of light is the womb, and also representative of Jessie's current reality before this scene. She is surrounded by light, but as the camera pulls out it reveals more and more blackness, the \"Demon\" consumes the frame and her as well. \n\n\nI\u2019m still working on a full analysis, but would love to hear what you all have to think about it. \nIt\u2019s quite refreshing how Refn juxtaposes Neon/Facade with Reality/Demons, yet the first half is clearly real and the second half is clearly fake/dream. The way he uses the cinematography to paint such beautiful allegory floored me. \n", "I really loved Elle Fanning and the little mannerisms she put into her character and I like the character development from shy to god-like. Still one of the most craziest films I've seen especially from the last 20 minutes but god I need to see it so many more times just to appreciate the craftsmanship of it.", "Not just the relationship between her and Jena Malone, but the nuance in their performances reminded me of Mulholland Drive. Brilliant film.  ", "Here are a couple of things that I noticed that I have not seen discussed yet in this sub:  \n\nThe opening scene foreshadows Jessie's fate. We first see her as a murder victim who then disappears from the frame all together. Her throat is slit and she is disappeared. If that isn't a huge metaphor, albeit the darkest of all possible metaphors, for dreams being crushed in Los Angeles, then I don't know metaphors. It is also a very literal foreshadowing of the events to come.\n\nThere isn't much discussion on Dean in this thread. I feel that if the other models and Ruby had not killed Jessie, that it was very possible that Dean himself would have done it down the road after Jesse had abandoned him, which was inevitable because Dean was considered amateurish and often regarded as a nobody by everyone that interacted with him. Dean's expression in the first few shots of the film was not one of admiration  for Jessie, it was resentment. In my opinion, Dean was an angry person. Dean was also a part of one of the lighter moments in the film where the fashion designer asked him if his name was  \"Bean.\" That part gave me a laugh, but it also reinforced the fact that Dean was looked at as a nobody, not even worthy of the courtesy of listening when his name is spoken to the designer by Jessie.  Dean's fate was decided much more quickly than Jessie's when the designer felt Dean's stomach to check for abs and was immediately dismissed nonverbally by the designer. Poor ol Dean will never make it in the biz and that further reinforces his resentment for Jessie. ", "Saw it at 1 today, and kinda loved it. To me it was like Black Swan on LSD.", "I thought the movie was great! One of the things I noticed was that a lot of the shots were pointed at mirrors and which had me wondering why he did it in that manner. Luckily Nicolas Winding Refn was at the theater which I saw the movie and did a Q and A with the audience. He said that the mirrors were a representation of narcissism which worked for me. \n\n In regards to the third act when the shit hits the fan I have a theory about what it meant, although it may be a bit of a stretch: \n\nJesse represented true beauty. If we think about her representing true beauty then we can add a different angle to the attack that Ruby, Gigi and Sarah carry out. \n\n* Ruby is a make-up artist, make up being used to create an illusion of beauty and cover up human flaws. \n\n* Gigi constantly talks about plastic surgery, which she uses to create her version of beauty. \n\nBoth create beauty whereas Jesse *is* beauty. So they consume her in order to attain \"true beauty\" but because they are undeserving Ruby (I assume) dies when she bleeds out under the moon and Gigi kills herself when her body starts rejecting true beauty. \n\nAgain this is a stretch, and I don't know where Sarah falls into this. I want to watch it again to try and understand some of the themes. \n ", "\"Experience\" really is the best word to describe this film. I was completely consumed. It's hard to recommend to people who aren't fans of the unapologetically abstract, but those who are have a real treat to enjoy here.\n\nIt's funny, because I didn't particularly care for *Only God Forgives.* I think I wasn't in the same mindset then as I am now.

To be clear I thought Drive was a great movie and Only God Forgives was a bit unfairly maligned but this was just a load of pretentious, sloppy garbage.  A lot of people here are focusing on the visuals which, yes, were pretty, but this movie was horrendously directed, the pacing was awful, the script was terrible and, worst of all, it was miserably, unbearably dull.  And if I was supposed to be shocked by the third act I wasn't, but honestly by then I was so bored with the movie that Refn could have stuck anything in the last half hour and I still would have been bored.  I know I wasn't the only one in the theater who was bored either.  Several people walked out and I came really close to walking out myself but chose to stick it out anyway.  Those who did  stick it out with me were pretty openly showing their contempt for the movie too, mocking it and openly discussing how bad it was.

I am totally down for some over-the-top Refn beautiful pulp, just don't make it dull.\n\n\nI liked Valhalla Rising, Bronson, Drive and Only God Forgives, but found this mainly to be disappointing because there's just so many shots that linger too long, too many flat interactions between characters, just overall not enough substance for two hours.\n\n\nI'm fine with deliberate pacing, but give me something to feel engaged by, some tension, some something.", "I absolute adored this film (like this is probably gonna become an all time favorite) but I don't think this really anything more then a trashy genre film slathered with flashy makeup. There's some fairly surface level critiques of society's obsession with beauty, but it's nothing new, and most of the meaning behind the absolutely gorgeous visuals is pretty obvious (3 predatory cats=3 predatory girls, runway scene lights change from blue to red because Jesse has become \"the neon demon\") though there's probably still some stuff I didn't notice on my first viewing.  \nEdit-the above sounds kind of negative but I think it's a great movie, that sometimes goes beyond a genre film into more \"arthouse\" territory.\n\nAlso Keanu Reeves, Elle Fanning, and Jenna Malone were all fantastic (especially Fanning holy shit!) and Martinez's score is one of the best I've ever heard. \n\nIf I were to rate my enjoyment of this I would honestly say a 10, but if I were to objectively rate this I would say its around an 8.", "I loved how desolate the movie felt. There's a strong sense of isolation that infects this film, like a virus  slowly proliferating as it invades the host. Apart from the main cast we don't really see anyone else. And when we do they seem lifeless, nonexistent. There's no background; an intentional decision made by Nicolas Winding-Refn, I'm sure. ", "First, let me just get this out of the way:\n\nThe score and cinematography/aesthetics are as good as it gets. That was pretty much expected. Refn and Cliff Martinez are masters at what they do best. This movie is worth seeing just for that alone. \n\nSecond, if this movie doesn't win an award for Sound Mixing they might as well retire that category from award shows. There's this sequence where the main characters does her 'runway' debut, it probably lasts 10 minutes give or take. The transitions of three different score tracks is mixed so smoothly, you can hear the main melody of the first track; albeit distorted and modulated as fuck, at the end of the third part of the sequence. What's amazing about this is that those 3 tracks are different from their version on the soundtrack. As the sequence progresses, the scores are building (mixing) one on top of the other creating one epic son of a bitch at the conclusion of it all. Very very subtle shit.\n\nHaving said that, plot/screenplay wise this movie is probably the worst I've seen from Refn. *Only God Forgives* was already bad but this one takes the prize. It feels empty and rather dull. The idea was great but the execution of it took the second seat in favor of the aesthetics. The usage of Christina Hendricks and Keanu was ridiculous. There is not point for their characters to be part of the story. A lot of time is wasted in things that do not add absolutely anything. Might as well be a music video.\n\nBut anyway, I believe I'll be watching the movie a couple of times when it comes out on bluray. I did not pay attention to the symbolisms that much as I was getting frustrated with the whole thing. But I'm sure there might be something interesting in there.\n\n", "8/10 \nI loved many things about this movie. \n\nThe people Jesse encounters, the agent who recruits her (Christina Hendricks) and the fellow models (Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote and Abbey Lee), all radiate an aura of predation towards her. She becomes successful as much through her naivet\u00e9 and vulnerability as through her beauty.\n\nIt\u2019s an intense and visually stunning movie, with tense moments of soft horror reminiscent of Black Swan and a memorable blend of sight and sound. It is like stepping into an art project that studies the interplay between color and the human form.\n\nThe style feels coherent, living and tantalizing. Style, however, is what makes most of the film. The story is slim and a bit slow, not much more than a fairy tale stretched out, and the characters are simple. It is a story of premonitions; references to predators, especially big cats, are everywhere.\n\nEmotionally, this is a cold world without human connection, but red and white feelings of paranoia and power are everywhere. Elle Fanning is a great casting choice because she seems so vulnerable and inexperienced. At the start, she is unshaped, like clay. She doesn\u2019t know who she is or what she will become.\n\nIt is a visual feast, a carnival and a nightmare at the same time. There isn\u2019t much of a story, but it is still one of the more unique films of the year and will linger in you for the rest of the day, if not the week.\n\nFor my complete review, [click here](https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/the-neon-demon-2016-review/).", "well, apparently the public hates it, because it did next to nothing at the box office", "Personally I also loved contrast between Ruby's insane lust for Jesse,  so intense,she gets sooo turned on by just thinking of her soft and tender image, that she actually rapes the corpse. At the same time, the two hot model girls in the shower, after the \"meal\", would be considered a very mainstream hot and passionate image. Ruby is, however, indifferent to those girls, because they ain't shit.

And only 3 of them. In the whole country! 2 in Istanbul and 1 in Ankara.  I had to go to the other side of the Ankara-the capital city- to watch it.\n\nI was questioning this stupid decision of the cinemas, but when I arrived, there were 5 people, including me.\n\nAfter watching it, I'm surprised that it's allowed in Turkey. If someone had to release this on TV, people would burn the studios of that channel.\n\nBut damn. The movie was great. I'll preorder the bluray.", "That eyeball scene!!", "I absolutely loved the movie. This was the third Refn film I'd seen after *Drive* and *Only God Forgives*, and it is by far my favorite. It was beautifully shot. The music was fantastic. Elle Fanning and Jena Malone were great. Honestly, I really liked everything about it. A lot of people in my audience hated it, so I expect responses will (unsurprisingly) be quite polarizing. I'd definitely recommend seeing it if you're at all interested, though.", "Can we talk about Ruby's role in the film? I can't quite pin it, but I have a feeling she represents something in particular. For example, in the scene where she introduces herself to Jesse, she's wearing a tie. After the pool death scene, she waters the yard topless, exposing tattoos, while wearing tapered sweatpants. She holds the hose as she looks off screen. We might assume she's washing away blood, but they don't show it. The shot is drawn out so much I figured we were supposed to gather something from it. Idk, that it seemed like he wanted the hose to be phallic. The only thing I can't make sense of was the menstruation/full moon part, which screams femininity to me.\n\nThoughts?\n\n\nAlso, did anyone else think that they occasionally enlarged Sarah's eyes?", "Really liked the use of makeup throughout the film", "This is probably one of my favourite films of the year, but there's one bit that's driving me crazy. \n\nThe scene when Gigi and Sarah chase Jesse through the house ... how do they end up in that weird back hallway that looks like it's from the party/club scene near the beginning? And then exits out into the pool area again?\n\nIs that just some magical realism going on or are those the same location?", "I felt that the absurdist sequences were contrived (i.e. when Jesse is looking into the  prism for like 5 minutes). ", "Saw it 7pm Saturday night opening weekend. 7 people altogether in the theatre.\n\nLoved the visuals, sound and music. David Lynch meets Helmut Newton meets Dario Argento. Also reminded me of The Hunger and Liquid Sky, two of my favorite films. But I started getting impatient starting with the scene of Elle Fanning kissing herself. And I outright laughed at the retrograde predatory lesbian scenes, because they just seemed so antiquated (which might have been the point, given how 70s the movie felt).\n\nOverall, I thought it was rather silly, but the mood was enough that I will almost certainly rewatch it on the large screen TV when it's available for home viewing. Might appreciate it more after that.", "Great movie, visually awesome and even better music. However, maybe I missed something, but what was up with that final scene with Ruby, where she laid on the floor in the moon light? Still trying to figure out how that scene fits into the movie...", "A little late, but I just saw this last night and thought I'd share my thoughts here. \n\nJust saw it last night and honestly, I really liked it and was glad I saw it on a big screen with a great sound system. Every single shot was insanely beautiful and the score/sound mix/sound design just added to the perfection. It was a totally different experience from almost any other film I've ever seen.\n\nI'd seen a few reviews before watching it and was intrigued because it seemed like everyone either really loved this movie or really hated it. Most of the negative reviews I saw were about the slow pace, lack of real characters and simple story, but after seeing the movie I think they're missing the point a little bit. The story and characters, as they are, are fixtures, pieces there to move from one shot to the next. It's really not trying to tell an in depth story with characters who have amazingly deep arcs. The film seemed to be trying to create a beautiful, strange tableaux that provided an emotional experience through sound and image, rather than character or narrative. It's a little like complaining that a painting doesn't have a good story.\n\nAlso, I was expecting more horror. There were definitely some some horror elements, definitely some gore, but not much. Maybe 2-3 scenes. The most effective horror movies elements, were, I think in how the film created a palpable sense of dread throughout, constantly keeping you teetering on this edge where you felt like something terrible was about to happen, even as you watched gorgeous scenes unfold.\n\nThere were a couple sequences that seemed to go on a little too long and the movie felt like it kept puttering on for ten minutes after an obvious end point. There were times when I felt it was a little cavalier about things like rape and violence against women.\n\nBut, all in all, I thought the performances were all fantastic, with Jena Malone and Keanu Reeves being the real standouts. It was one of the most beautiful looking movies I've ever seen. I definitely recommend seeing it in the theater, on a big screen with a good sound system. Despite a couple flaws, I really enjoyed the experience of watching it. In a world where everything is a sequel to a reboot of a comic book movie, this was a breath of eerily beautiful fresh air.", "Refn you fucking madman. 8.5/10", "One other thing I found interesting - I have a copy of NWR's book - the Act of Seeing. It's this huge, heavy coffee-table book that's literally just reproductions of hundreds of full page exploitation movie posters from this collection he bought - all the most gratuitous and over the top stuff you can imagine. In his introduction/notes, he writes:\n\n*\"But which posters would make it into the final selection? As I toyed around with possible themes and strands, it became obvious to me that many of the movies considered were made with a distinct aesthetic approach, no matter how awkwardly realized, and on a fetishized basis, which the subsequent campaigns completely reflected. The ones I found most interesting in my collection are the films that deal with a singular immature frustration, primal sex and violent images geared towards a specific urge.\"*\n\nThat was one of the most interesting things about The Neon Demon to me as well; while watching it, it felt like a clear nod to that same aesthetic - to that kind of exploitation cinema - yet it played in my local multiplex here in 2016. And of course, the first thing he says in his Rolling Stone interview about it - *\"It's a camp movie.\"*", "This is the weirdest, most beautiful film I have seen in a long time and I think I loved it.

Not as good as Drive but better than Only God Forgives, and I loved Only God Forgives.\n\nI think the epilogue was a little too long but it was alright. I can't believe I was the only one in the theater opening night. I loved that the film totally went for it with some of the dark stuff. That Jena Malone scene.... How do you even convince an actor to do that?\n\nWould recommend.", "Really enjoyed Neon Demon. I've never seen anything quite like it. Had previously seen Drive, and was blown away by Refn's artful direction, beautiful visuals, and excellent score. Very interesting film due to its willingness to go to dark places a lot of movies don't. The third act definitely weirded me out, but was handled well and made sense with the movie's message of the dark depths that beauty can take people to. Looking forward to seeing Elle Fanning in more projects. She's a very solid actress.", "After having the day to digest the movie....\n\nI know there is a lot of themes running through this movie and everyone's take on it is great. The one thing that stands out to me is the obsession almost everyone has. \n\nRuby is obsessed with Jesse and lusts for her. \nGigi is obsessed with being perfect, the surgeries she has to obtain that status and how Jesse is naturally beautiful is\nSarah is obsessed with staying relevant in a world were after 22 you are no long relevant. \nEven Dean is obsessed with Jesse that he wants to keep her innocent and grounded and seeing this side of Jesse that the others don't. \n\nNot sure where Jesse's obsession is, but ultimately she is the vehicle that drives everyone's obsession", "At first I wasn't impressed by the movie, but the more I reflect, the more I am drawn back into the narrative about society's views on beauty, and the journey the characters take. It has hypnotized me, like a painting at a museum you just have to see again. Abbey Lee had a breakout performance. ", "Oh shit...\n\n\"A special kind of awful. I'd talk about the acting, but I never saw any; it's all posing. Director Refn seems to be saying that the L.A. beauty business is superficial and needs to be avoided. Ditto this movie.\"\n\n - Peter Travers | Rolling Stone", "Saw it a few weeks ago and I still think about it from time to time.\n\nThe story was decent, but it was the soundtrack and the cinematography that made this so, so amazing. Worth seeing on the big screen just for that.", "He breaches plenty of postmodern looking-at-others-look-at-you, your value is based solely on being admired stuff, which is always relevant, and his visual gifts are enchanting and acid-like cold and crisp, but he needs collaborative input at the conceptual level, it seems. The whole story and setting scream Easy Target, and it's rather obvious where everything is headed from pretty early on. Perhaps the rampant obviousness was part of his point, approaching satire, giving him ample opportunity to hammer us with his mythology-based storytelling; his moves produce impacts but they never seem shocking or half-way original. The archetype breakdowns in Only God Forgives were much hazier and more effective for it. This is like the world's most obvious modern Kafka short story, stretched and strobed to the point of interpretive nausea. Clearly modeling is suspect, but are any participants exempt from the greed and envy and evil the enterprise can contain? If the appearance of innocence is the only truly innocent thing available anymore, what does he suggest as alternatives?\n\nI also sort of see it as an anti-feminist film, either despite his intentions or because of them. Everyone's a wolf in flowing clothing here except our initial photographer, who is spared all critique despite his role in the world of trying to capture beauty -- though his penchant for critique by the slashed throat concept probably aligns him more with what Refn sees himself as, the horrified male observer. His aw-shucks earnestness and cool vintage car kind of bothered me this time, as steeped in shtick as everything else. \n\nPerhaps he'll get to the point where he might offer some notions of healing or understanding in his portraits of human life. Not that Kubrick ever really did, he was too obsessed with investigating the animal, but Jodorowski sort of does in his way, and PT Anderson and Roy Andersson let a sort of heavy lightness through. True as they can feel, I think we have enough horror films and are numb to them now, so what real value does another heinous portrait hold?   \n\nI will definitely see it again, but am very sure it could have been better if his target was more off-centered; plus he won't lose anything through swifter edits and maybe allowing for improv and looseness, this thing felt way too tightly-gripped overall.

It felt like great commentary on the way women often rip each other down and how society encourages it. This idea that the only way to get power is to take someone else's was really striking. ", "Saw it last night and really enjoyed it. I'm getting the sense that many of the big reviewers who are ripping it to shreds went in already having decided they were going to hate it, as some of the criticisms I've seen on major publications are insulting it for simply being what it is. \n\nI thought it was pretty stylish, appropriately dark, campy in a horror way, and actually unsettling at times. \n\nI think my favorite thing is actually how cunning Jesse was. She comes off as such an innocent at the beginning that you feel afraid for her, then she turns out to be just as power-hungry as the others. ", "Saw this at an early show on Thursday.  I really enjoyed it for what it was.  It's a beautiful art film that's meant to inspire discussion and debate I believe.  I have a strong belief that a film is meant to be an experience and I don't know of any other filmmakers right now besides NWR that can create an experience like this film.", "The film was every bit as pretentious as *Only God Forgives*, but in addition to that, it sported a surfeit of gross scenes and a feeling after the film was over like I'd just spent the last two hours getting molested on a city bus.\n\nI keep watching Refn's films thinking they're going to be the next *Drive*, and I keep coming out of them disappointed.", "After watching this, I become addicted to the ending song, Sia's waving goodbye : https://youtu.be/CeB3yfBobik", "Those bitches bathing in blood though.

The use of slow zooms and pans from 2001 and beyond, the direction of the actors felt like the first act of the Shining, and there were two direct references (red rum, and the Lolita reference). Ruby drawing on the mirror in lipstick seemed to directly mirror her completely losing her mind and becoming a demon, just like Jack in the Shining. The room 214 also felt like the Shining 's room 237, from the Tiger to Jessie imagining the Keanu Reeves character sticking a blade down her throat. Rehn plays with light color a lot more than Kubrick, but besides that it felt a lot like a neo-Kubrick film.\n\nSince I love Kubrick, this is a huge positive. But it may explain the critical ambivalence, and many of Kubrick's films also experienced confusion in their initial critics. For example, the Shining was very much panned.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and how can I forget? Bathrooms play a huge significance in this movie.

I lost count how many times they used Dues ex Machina.\n\nJessie Usher's character going completely out of his way to fail at rescuing his mom was awful and cheesy. The whole thing with his mom dying had no actual effect on his story arc. He cried for like 2 minutes and them baby Hemsworth comes along and says \"hey bro, don't cry. You got to lead us!\" And that was fucking it. He never got his revenge. He never talks about having the issue resolved.

It feels like it could have happened because the world was one that we recognized and could relate too. It made all of the loss and destruction pack a huge punch. One of the biggest problems with this movie, is that now that we have utilized the aliens technology, the world to the viewer is unrelatable. As a result, all of the stakes were gone, and none of the loss and destruction felt real. A lot of the destruction was kind of swept under the rug and never even addressed in the movie. So much destruction happened and nobody really acknowledges it, and that bothered me a lot. Then add in all of these characters that I could give a shit about, and its a mess of a film. Some fun moments were had, but the more I think about it the less I like it, which fucking sucks because the original was so damn good.", "I thought it was ok, some cool moments but didn't pack the \"punch\" that the original did", "What I think is most disappointing, is how after waiting 20 years for a sequel that was as bad as this movie was, the ending made it seem like an even worse third film will be on its way in 2 years.

They didn't take time to expand on or flesh out *anything*, so you end up not caring about a single thing and the entire movie feels very rushed.  If they took the time to elaborate on and properly setup the pieces they had, as well as properly pace things out, this movie could have the potential to be as good as the first.  Instead, they give incredibly brief introductions that they rarely go back and expand on, make decisions so fast that you don't feel any emotion / tension about it, and have stuff happen so quick that you really don't care about what's going on or who is involved.\n\nIf this movie was an hour longer and took time to add proper pacing in order to setup better character development, tension, and depth, it would have been a totally different movie.\n\nThat said, if you are going in not expecting much and just want a fun CGI-filled flick, this movie definitely fits the bill.

Even the city destruction that felt so visceral in the first film fell completely flat here.\n\nThe plot is a mess and there are pacing issues all over the place. Nothing really seems connected all that well and logical inconsistencies are so frequent that I started to become confused. See, it would be fine if it takes a few leaps since \"it's just a movie\" but there were so many weird things that it just became distracting. Really took me out of the movie. \n\nThere are too many new characters that weren't developed well. That Hemsworth character was so bland, and his girlfriend had more development in the first movie. \n\nI really wished we got to see that world where species are taught how to defeat the aliens.

It's almost like they went out of way to do so (USAF enlisted rank insignias for flag officers? I saw a Tech Sergeant General...). \n\nFinally... no big speech. I counted two that looked like they were on track to be, but nope, they seem to get cut off and that's it. \n\nI will say though, I really like that tech improved markedly in that 20 years. There is a good lore here that could be made into a fun series of films. Imagine that the next one takes place 50 years in the future (all of those old characters are dead or retired or whatever). Earth and the other species on the sanctuary world wage all out warfare against the alien menace. But things have changed: Earth is a hypermilitarized, technologically advanced society where everyone must serve to help eradicate the alien threat. Because we are so numerous, and since we're twice victorious, the other species bow down to us as we lead the coalition against the aliens. Maybe over time we start to see the other sanctuary species as beneath us and we subjugate/enslave them into service for the galaxy. And perhaps maybe, in doing so, we aren't so different from the aliens looking to steal our resources. Maybe those sanctuary species need an Independence Day of their own. There's potential here in the right hands. Those hands are not Roland Emmerich. ", "Honestly, it was pretty bad.

The two Chinese characters didn't add anything to the film.  I did find the fact the white guy doesn't really get the Chinese girl plot line pretty humorous, guess they didn't want to hurt the Chinese male psyche. \n\nEdit: For some reason people took my last few comments to mean I'm against Chinese people.  I'm an Afghan-American, and Afghanistan is part of Asia.  I have nothing against minorities, since I happen to be one myself.

But...how could those aliens be able to fight/move without a queen to guide them? Is this ever explained at all or...?", "Ok, let's cut to the chase; Independence Day: Resurgence is not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.  It has weak acting, bland characters, too many plot threads and a lot of contrived moments designed to tug at your heartstring.  However, you can still have fun with this movie as a mindless invasion movie once you realize what type of movie it is.  \n  \nI love the first movie and it had its flaws as well.  It was a super unrealistic and campy movie that was designed as a simple popcorn flick.  Resurgence, however seems torn between what it wants to be.  On the one half it tries to be an expansive space drama weaving together multiple stories to build a much larger universe with more at stake than meets the eye.  On the other half it wants to be a fun popcorn flick about killing aliens.  Resurgence was only partially successful at one half of it, the mindless action.  This would be ok, if it tried to let go of the other half but they were intent on trying to turn this into a grand space opera and it falls apart.  \n  \nThe flaws with the story is that it doesn't make sense in the grander narrative that was written in the previous ID movie and it doesn't make sense now.  I remember watching the scene where the aliens trick the human fighters into the hanger then destroy them and the humans get stranded in the ship.  This is a super ship with countless alien troops on it but not only do all the troops who land on the ship survive but they manage to capture multiple enemy fighters while taunting them to their face.  As unrealistic as it is that they evade all the ground troops, the movie demonstrates that the command ship can override fighters so that scene where they escape the ship should not have happened.  There are just too many unbelievable scenes to make sense so I'll list as many as I can think of right now.  \n  \n* His dad gets caught in the path of a Tsunami so he takes his boat and heads to shore.  This is the exact opposite that you should do because a Tsunami doesn't magically stop at shore, it levels everything in it's path and a boat ain't traveling on land much.  However, not only does he survive, he's unharmed.  \n* The ship is so large it has its own gravity, except when it doesn't have it's own gravity (I guess it gets to choose when).  \n* Nobody, I mean nobody, seems to notice a space ship the size of the Atlantic until it is right over them for a couple of seconds.  \n* The military apparently only has a couple hundred fighters and they're all in the US.  \n* Also, everyone is pretty incompetent.  The general at the moon base tells everyone to evacuate after the enemy starts firing a laser at them.  The President orders them to fire on that sphere then goes, *Well, now that that's done back to the celebrations*.  Exactly, you wouldn't want to have your best experts investigating it and hold off celebrating until you were certain it wasn't an advance scout would you?  The Jewish father (and I'm not being racist, that's literally his whole character) decides to drive a bunch of kids to a war zone.  There are many many more instances.  \n* Next is the coincidences, Holy Shit are there a lot or what.  You got Lab Doctor waking up just as his buddy is saying it's been 7,300 (omg, who would have guessed).  You got Hillards mom dying just as he arrives (and of course she dies saving someone so that the scene is even more tragic *oh no, another selfless hero lost to this tragedy, we are all now connected the protagonist's story now* ), then we find out Jake's parents died too (omg, they have a connection now and can relate).  You got Jake's buddy finding that Chinese chick and saying he's in love (which takes seconds I guess) and then she decides to go for him at the end because the script says she would.  We also find out that Lab science dude has a special laser he made (of course he did).  Jewish dad is randomly driving towards a war zone and happens to run into David because of course he would be there.  None of the main cast have kids we can exploit for emotional points, that's ok, we'll literally drive a busload of them into danger to hit that checkbox.  \n* The alien ship practically does nothing.  That's right, that awesome ship from the trailers the size of the entire atlantic ocean and some countries is just a mining ship apparently.  No massive invasion by millions of alien troops, no fleets of alien fighters wiping out all cities, just mining.  \n* The aliens are just as stupid.  When they find out the Deus Ex Machina is on Earth the queen decides to personally go and get it even though it could send a massive fleet and army and not risk destroying her forces.  \n* I think, in the end the biggest weakness is bland characters.  Will Smith lite is practically a cardboard cutout of an actor.  Liam Hemsworth is ok but doesn't have the charisma to carry it.  Jeff Goldblum seemed less like David and more like Jeff Goldblum playing David.  The president's daughter seemed like she was there so that they could have more emotional scenes between characters which didn't work.  The writing isn't good enough to do it.  Nobody seemed truly scared about the outcomes or seemed to react to actions that happen except when it's decided to really show the emotions (which come off as fake).  \n  \nSo overall, I give it a 4/10.  It's not the worst movie and there were certainly scenes I liked but they came few and far between to carry the movie.", "The blatant China pandering was hard to sit through.

That is the only way I can describe what I saw.", "Good god, this movie is like how a child could really coeceive a movie like it's still in movie development and how they are supposed to act out.\n\nYes, it's supposed to be a popcorn flick, a type of fun-B-action adventure movie, so you're not going to expect any Academy-award type of thing or the level like the movie Guardians of the Galaxy. But this movie basically have no plot and no convincing character development whatsoever; it's all nothing but a bunch of shooting and trying out new gadgets. No hero-like moments in this film, it's like remaking almost the same scenes with 2016 technology instead of the 1996 one. The storyline is messed up and it's struggling to recreate the first film, which fails short. Worse of all is the characters. You expect to see some of the old characters return and learn their old ways for the better, yet the most significant of them have little time screen or are completely unrecognizable or being thrown off course and not knowing what to do. I didn't recognize that Will Smith's wife was a doctor until I got home even if Steven Hiller's son called her out \"mom\". It also didn't feel like a really 4th of July thing movie; it doesn't have this 4th of July type of movie you really wanted, but just another action movie that could have taken place at any date.\n\nMy problem with the characters.\n\n* Former President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) is like...I can't describe: awful. First, he wasn't feeling well due to the alien senses he obtained since the first movie. I mean, I feel for him and I can certainly understand why he was like that, but from time to time, Whitmore began to feel bad, then good, bad then good. It's like really, the movie needs to make up it's mind of what his true character is. And worst of all, his suicide scene. There was no serious build up to that scene like Randy Quiad's character (Russell Casse) in the first movie. He just go straight up to the ship then detonates a bomb just like that, killing himself. I didn't really expect that, it feels like \"nah, whatsoever\" type of stuff. Russell Casse suicide scene is far more emotional and heroic than Thomas Whitmore. And even so, killing off Thomas Whitmore, a popular figure of the 1996 movie, makes the movie even more dumber than ever.\n\n* Elizabeth Lanford (Sela Ward) as President of the United States is just cheap, just awful too. Not too convincing to be a real leader. After the U.S. Air Force were seemingly destroyed by the alien spaceship, the aliens finally to break in Cheyenne bunker and killed her and most of her staff. It's like she doesn't know what she's doing at all. That's no real leadership, she's just an incompetent person who doesn't really know how to lead. For godsakes, it's like 20 fucking years for the whole United States and the world to develop a serious contingency plan and yet you as a leader don't know what to actually do?\n\n* Dylan Dubrow-Hiller (Jessie Usher) is just as awful too. Ok, his father died in the 2007 crash and his mother in the second film, that's bad enough, but He was supposed to be a leader. Instead, he acts like what you expect from a clueless private in the United States Army. He acts like one of the pilots he was supposed to be leading, and demonstrates no heroism in it.\n\n* Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe) is a least slight better than what I thought. She became a fighter pilot as a result of the 1996 war and the death of her mother and took care of her father who became ill due to the alien senses and was forced to take time off as a result. She seems to be determined to fight the aliens and never gave up hope. However, her character falls flat yet again as the rest of the characters, as she has no convincing meaningful significance to the major plots. First, she became worried then goes off to the guy for like 30 seconds like a boy's band. Since Thomas Whitmore died, she became an orphan as a result. So what direction is she going to go now? Again, as said, there was no serious build up and she was crying, but then decides to forget her dad's death, as if his death means nothing to here. I'm like really?!!!! Hello, your dad just died and you act like as if nothing significant happened to you at all.\n\n* Jake Morrison (Liam Hensworth)...uhh I don't know what to say. He became an orphan as a result of the 1996 war and became a fighter pilot, he became too cliche and lacking any serious charisma even to his girlfriend. He also demonstrates no serious leadership like Steve Hiller's son. Other than to do it by sheer luck in most of the odds they meet.\n\n* Charlie (Travis Tope)...honestly who is this guy anyways? He's just another cocky guy and tries to have a flat-out romance with Rain Lao. He doesn't have any charm whatsoever than trying to act like a boy-toy Shawn Micheals type.\n\n* Jasmine Hiller (Vivica A. Fox). Her death scene. Really? Her son flew to her exact location just as she is at the top of her collapsing building? And why? Why was any of that scene needed? It was just lazy writing. More cliche.\n\n* Juliius Levison (Judd Hirsch). Oh man, from a guy who contributes so much to the first movie, he was so unnecessary to this movie. All he does is driving across the desert in a school bus filled with children even after surviving a tidal wave on his boat in the Pacific (with barely a scratch) and meets David while there is a major battle going on? Might as well kill him off and the plot would remain the same, except David might use his car to evade the zigzags.\n\nThese are my thoughts to the movie, but I'm happy to hear your opinions on all of this and I would gladly argue.", "**TL;DR this is how I end my opinion of the movie: Whatever. It was a summer blockbuster and I didn't expect much going in, but it was pretty damn bad.**\n\nI was really into the first act of the movie! It was cool seeing how humanity had advanced in the 20 years since the first movie. I was also really into the mystery element being set up by David and... the British/French psychiatrist (?) who just happened to be there the whole time and who served as a \"love interest\"... whatever. Finally, the special effects of the destruction was pretty freaking awesome. It looked great and that ship felt as big as the Atlantic Ocean as it was landing.\n\nOf course, none of it felt very impactful as far the characters go. Why the hell was Vivica A. Fox even in this movie!? I felt absolutely no connection between her and her son and she just dies in such a nonchalant way as he watches, does his obligatory \"NOOOOOO!\" scream, and then we're off to another scene. The swath of principal characters in the tug ship had a pretty lackluster escape scene and I was having trouble suspending my disbelief when everything is getting sucked up by the ship's ultimately-indecisive gravity but it all seems to be harmlessly sucked up **right in front of them** and not, you know, squishing them from their underside.\n\nAs good as the destruction effects were, I thought the aliens had some pretty terrible cgi, especially the queen. I'm not talking about her fighting in her giant biosuit at the end. That looked pretty damn good. I'm talking about anytime we saw her outside of her suit. I can think of two times in particular:\n\n* When we see her get into the suit for the first time and she does a little snarl as the face plate closes.\n\n* When she dies and everyone is standing around her gooey corpse. It looked like some Protoss death cutscene from Broodwar.\n\nAdditionally, what happened to the aliens who were hunting down the pilots that had ejected in the mother ship? Were they all killed with the pilots' pistols (which, for some reason, weren't souped up human/alien fused tech like the rifles)? Did they just shrug their shoulders and say, \"Fuck it. They'll die anyway.\" I definitely had a \"Oh fuck, they're still alive and completely unharmed without any explanation at all\" moment when it cut to them trying to steal the alien fighters, which was another nonsensical scene. I mean, what purpose did Liam Hemsworth's character's \"distraction/bait\" serve? They looked to be sneaking into the fighters just fine. The aliens in the tower weren't even fucking paying attention to the ground *until* Hemsworth started his little thing.\n\nThat leads me into something else. These characters were soooo boring. There were fucking two goofy/nerdy white guys tropes, one older and one younger. The older one was basically Gennaro from Jurassic Park, but Gennaro wasn't even half as annoying and at least he died midway through. The younger one played a wimpy Robin to Hemsworth's \"Batman\". Maika Monroe's character bordered between fine and forgettable and her relationship with Hemsworth's character felt so utterly fake. I don't know many African warlords, but the one in this movie sure seemed like a swell guy. Someone else said this about David. Instead of David Levinson, it seemed like we were getting Jeff Goldblum's impression of himself playing David. That takes me to Bill Pullman... Jesus Christ. *At least* give him a good speech. He just strolls on out, out of the fucking blue, to give his farewell talk and I have to ask, could he have possibly seemed to care less? God, he sounded so weak and feeble. I was much more into the psychologically traumatized version of his character. His acting made so much more sense for that version. But we were left with fucking geriatric Mickey Mouse delivering the final pep talk. Lastly on the characters, Okun was fine but did we need so much of his \"quirky\" charm? Also, I found myself asking what the fuck I had just watched after his line that ended the movie (the \"we're really gonna go kick some alien ass\" line that so abruptly ended it). Actually, that whole last part about \"taking the fight to them\" felt very shoehorned.\n\nQuickly, how many scenes were there with characters going berserk and doing an \"AHHHH!\" scream while shooting as many bullets as possible? Too many for me at least. I definitely remember Monroe doing it in her fight against the queen and okun doing it when helping out Gennaro and friendly African warlord in the bunker. But it feels like there were a few other times that it happened. \n\nTo end this rant, that stupid sphere thing was useful as a decoy and that's it. Couldn't the writers have come up with another way to have a decoy? Its existence just seemed so unnecessary. Besides, how good can their weapons really be? The sphere said that its people had fought against these aliens for a thousand (or was it thousand*s*) of years and they couldn't win. If it and the other species it's training have the weapons to kill the aliens... then go ahead and fucking do it. Do the entire universe a god damned favor and do it. What's stopping you? It's also the last one. What? Has it been going of by itself this whole time to collect myriad species of freedom fighters? How long has that taken? Aren't the other people who have been training to fight the bad aliens getting a little antsy at this point?\n\nWhatever. It was a summer blockbuster and I didn't expect much going in, but it was pretty damn bad.", "Well, here we are. I am someone who likes the first Independence Day, some people give it a bunch of shit, but after seeing Resurgence you are gonna have to reevaluate your stance. The first one was a much tighter story, and it had a good balance of humor and seriousness. When the cities were destroyed you kinda felt them impact of the destruction. In Resurgence, it happens really quickly and it is practically an after thought. I think that RLM Re:view (that I didn't quite agree with on many points) would be completely accurate for this movie instead. It really beats you over the head with shit and was generally kind of blah. That whole Judd Hirsch and the kids adventure was like...what is going on here? \"I bet they are gonna put them smack dab in the middle of the battle....yep, they did it. The crazy son of a bitch, he did it\".\n\nOverall I liked it for what it was, even though there were a ton of eye rolling moments. This movie was cheesier than Wisconsin. There were a lot of ham fisted scenes and just terrible dialogue, but some of it was fun. I did like seeing the technology and a little more expansion on the aliens. I'm kind of a sucker for Sci Fi ships, weapons, bases..etc.  I honestly felt that the Sphere and sentient AI race didn't fit the core of what Independence Day was. Clearly they are setting up a sequel where Earth is a full on intergalactic superpower that \"kicks some serious alien ass\". Jesus, I can't believe the movie ended on that line.\n\nAlso, why the fuck is the Eiffel Tower still standing after literally everything else is destroyed?

Liam Hemsworth was okay, but I felt like the character needed to be more enthusiastic.\n\nAlso, (just for laughs) am I the only who noticed Pullman shaved before suiting up for flight at the end?

And your first remark on this catastrophe is \"they really like to go for the land marks\"? Really? Also, is this a reference to the original? If so isn't it a little too presumptuous to say this, given that the Aliens are uprooting entire cities and the space craft is almost the fucking RADIUS of the planet Earth?

Would anyone really chuckle when their husband says \"well, we'll get the house if the neighbourhood is still standing haha\" come on...\n\nThe ending of the movie was mindbogglingly idiotic as well. The sphere turns out to be a sentient machine, a vessel for the consciousness of a member of a highly advanced species, who can decipher the English language - including the words it haven't heard yet? ffs whatever - just by listening to people for a few seconds due to how primitive we are.\n\nRight after that, the movie reveals this infinitely complicated extra terrestrial ambassador asks humans to lead the fight, because the primitive humans devised a plan that utilizes a decoy signal to fool of the queen. At this point I think the viewers are expected to feel ecstatic about humans proving themselves at an intergalactic level.\n\nDid we, though? Is this how you can imagine it would unfold? We are talking about faster than light speed travel, consciousness transfer, sentient machines. These guys are obviously miles - no - mega parsecs ahead of us at being an advanced, intellectual civilization. And all the different species they unified, the collective mind of the cosmos could not think of a strategy that is complicated as you'd expect from a capture the flag game?\n\nYou know what, this is what I take from this movie: the sphere must be a sadistic fuck. Because nothing regarding the extraterrestrials made any sense and had no logical cohesion. If there is a third movie, it should be about how it was a ruse all along. That the sphere was also with the invaders and their grand scheme was to make humans believe that they can fight back but actually they were toying with us, to make us feel confident and proud and then lure all our fighters to their home to obliterate every single human being alive. And they should succeed. Because if this mess is forced to make any sense, this is the ONLY logical outcome.

David's father, Okun, and Randy Quaid were enough in the first movie.  They all had something to contribute to the plot.  Now, we have this goofy pencil pusher guy trying to be an action hero, and Hemsworth's dorky side kick.  They contributed nothing.\n\n3.  What the heck happened to David's ex wife?  At the end of the original movie, it seemed like they were getting back together.  Makes sense given their reasons for splitting.  Now we have this random scientist lady.\n\n4.  There's no way the ship had enough mass to have that much effect on the gravity in the movie.  It still had significantly less mass than the Earth and Moon.\n\n5.

Same thing with the very end, where the scientist says \"we're gonna kick some alien ass!\" It didn't build up all that well, it was just *bam* line and it ends. It wasn't God-awful but it felt a little weird.", "Wow lol. ITT: people jumping on the bandwagon to talk about what a shitshow the movie was.\n\nFor a sequel, I thought it was good. It brought back a lot of the cast, mostly in useful ways, and even though Will Smith wasn't in it it still paid homage to his character. Without spending ridiculous amounts of time on it, the movie did a good job covering all the important information about what's been happening in the last 20 years (destroyed cities rebuilt, world peace, understanding and development of alien technology).\n\nIt answered a handful of interesting questions that went unanswered in the first one, such as, 1) what the fuck were the aliens actually after, 2) are these guys the only other civilization out there, 3) did any of the ships from the first movie actually land, etc.\n\nI thought the warlord stuff was pretty cool (someone was ripping on it somewhere below). Very interesting unexplored plot thread that a single ship did actually touch down and there were human vs alien ground force skirmishes.\n\nSpiner really did a great job. Not much else to be said there. Some of the casting/acting was hit or miss, but some of it also was not, so that was fine with me.\n\nI really liked the idea that the aliens wanted our core. I don't really know what all to say about that, but it sent my mind off in a million directions. I think that has a lot of potential. I do think another sequel would really be stretching the movies, but going for our core made a lot more sense then going for... our water? our bio-matter? Anything else seems not really worth it given the resources that must have been expended to get here, but if you had to technology to tap into and extract the energy from a planet's core... I can buy that.\n\nAnyway I will skip posting any real complaints. There are more than enough in this thread. I went in excited and didn't leave disappointed. Some of the scenes and shots were fantastic. I went in hoping for a summer sci-fi action flick and that's exactly what I got. I saw a massive space ship 3,000 miles across land on earth and drill a hole a mile deep into our mantle. I saw a bunch of hybrid human-alien tech fighter jets fly up inside the mega mothership and try to detonate warheads inside it. I saw the president and the next four in the succession line after her all killed by aliens so they secretary of defense had to be sworn into office. I saw a mystery orb from another heretofore unknown species communicate with us and reveal a few more pieces of the larger puzzle. I saw an armored alien queen land on earth and engage in a land/air battle that we only won because the pilots of the above-mentioned fighter jets had stolen some alien spaceships and were able to unconventionally regain control of them after she took control of them. I saw a former president sacrifice himself to save the world and his daughter.\n\nI mean I'm sorry guys, what's not to like here. Do you even enjoy life.\n\nSmall footnote: was it just me or was Maika Monroe twitching her boob (like, a lot) in that last shot where she drew her handgun and was aiming into the smoke?", "I'm another person who loved the original and re-watched the first one last night before seeing the new one today.\n\nI'll be the first to get irritated when people complain about plot holes in summer blockbusters but there were a few things that bothered the crap out of me.\n\nThe biggest is the aliens coming back for our core. I really think they should have gone with a 'revenge' theme, aliens got pissed we blew a mother ship up and want to finish the job this time. \n\nThat stupid sphere is awful, everything about it annoys me, and the new actors were awful and there was way too many of them IMO.\n\nI think because I loved the first one so much I'm being overly critical of the sequel, the first one was a goofy alien movie but this wasn't even that. Not something I'll ever watch twice.\n\nI do wonder if this does bomb in the box office if they will cancel the 3rd one. I would like to see if they can improve.", "I liked it,it wasn't high art or anything, but it was very similar to the first in tone and style. In fact while it wasn't the best of the unecessary sequels to come out this year it felt the most 'necessary' in the sense that it felt like a good continuation to the first. \n\nThe world building was cool, the cgi was great, it was cheesy, but not completely unbarably so (most of the time), and it was just a good popcorn movie. I thought the new cast did a pretty good job with what they where given and while they all were stock characters is that really any different then the first? I think a lot of people give the first one too much credit, it was like this a good popcorn movie. That being said I had somethings I really liked and other things not so much. \n\nLiked: \n\nThe world building was really cool and I wish we could have seen more of it, but what we got was great.\n\nCharacters. They were exactly what I expected and in a few ways better. I never really cared for anyone, but the acting wasn't too shabby and overall seemed approprate. \n\nCGI. I am so use to seeing so much of it that normally it gets boring, but honestly this movie really stuck out for me in terms of it. It looked well done and the designs were at the very least average if not above\n\nThe returning cast. Of the actors who returned none of them felt hamfisted at all. They seemed to fit in and seemed to be having a good time. \n\nThe other aliens. It seems like not too many people liked this, but I think it was a smart move. After this movie a lot of people died and earth is fucked, so really having them in it is really the only way the story can continue. \n\nAliens! Really in general it is nice to  have another alien movie. What was the last big one? 5th Wave? Sucked and was barely an alien movie. Before that? Battle Los Angeles? That was years ago and was okay at best. Really this is the best one in years and it is nice to see that maybe Aliens might make a come back \n\nDisliked:\n\nThis one is weird, I actually liked the concept but hated the exicution. The kids and Jake's dad. I liked seeing the devastation on the ground and it added a tiny bit of heft. However the kids came off as annoying (besides the main one who seemed while annoying pretty real) and were just under used. I would have liked to see a bit of the journy across the destroyed east coast and get a sense of the scale of the destruction. \n\nInfact the destruction in general was lacking, it was all in the trailers and had no sense of heft or scale. It seemed like The big ship only sucked up a few places and dropped them, or was it all of Asia? I doubt that, but it was hard to tell. \n\nThe pacing was weird in general. I felt like a big chunk of the 2nd act where the fighter piliots where on the ship could have been cut and the focus moved to Earth. It just felt clunky and a tad tiring at that point. \n\nOver all I enjoyed it and would like to see more. It wasn't the best or as good as the first, but it was close and just fun.

I was just an extra; but there I was, up-front and in clear sight on film. I guess I could say it was surreal.\n\n**EDIT #1**: For those who are asking about being an extra. It's very easy, in that you don't need any acting experience; but it depends on where you live. Basically, use what would be the nearest metropolitan area to where you live. From the there, search to see if there's an extra casting agency in that city. Some cities get more work than others. LA, New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia are good examples of cities in the United States that frequently have movies and TV shows filming in the area.\n\nGenerally, you would either find these casting agencies from a web search (and you can apply from there). Other times, you will find out an open call for the latest film filming in said city. From there, you go in-person and sign up there. It's not the funniest of jobs in that you will mostly be sitting around for hours upon end doing nothing, really. However, you get paid to essentially do the bare minimum; and once you join SAG, the rates for doing BG work rise like crazy.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n**EDIT #2**: I was in the high school gym scene at the start of the movie.

", "I thought that the cameos of characters from the previous film were really great without being too fan service-y and out of place!", "I really like this movie. Although I still prefer the first on because of this couple of points:\n\n* **Finding Nemo** had a **greater sense of adventure.** You had Marlin and Dory travelling across the entire ocean and encountering so many different characters along the way. Scenes like the jellyfish hopping, Dory learning how to read the sign when being chased by sharks, the school of fish, those were all such memorable scenes. In **Finding Dory**, sure there was some ocean travelling, but the majority of the movie took place in only one location, which was that marine park. This to me did not made me feel more engaged in the movie as in Finding Nemo, you get to feel Marlin's pain of travelling across the entire ocean for his son. I didn't get to feel any sort of stakes being raised higher with Finding Dory. This isn't really a huge complaint, just an observation of the grand scale of adventure between both movies.\n\n* **Finding Nemo was more realistic**. Now you must be thinking, an animated movie about fish talking being realistic? What are you, crazy? When I say realistic, I mean the fishes behave the way fishes are physically allowed to. In **Finding Dory**, you had Hank the Octopus swinging from ceiling to ceiling, you had the Marlin and Nemo, sea water fishes, in a FRESH WATER fish tank, oh and who could forget that they landed in that dirty water mop bucket. I expected them to felt some discomfort a bit but nope, they were fine and dandy. Again, not another huge complaint. This didn't hinder my enjoyment out of the movie.\n\nNow for the things I really like:\n\n* **The Flashback Sequences**. Usually I can't stand flashbacks in movies, but I think the movie did a solid job on it. The flashbacks was paced so perfectly in the movie that it didn't feel annoying and I actually wanted more of them.\n\n* **The new supporting cast**. I was afraid they might rehash old characters from the first movie out of laziness but nope! Mostly new characters! Each of them have such a unique personality and you can relate to so much. Also love how there really wasn't a villain in the movie, thank god Pixar didn't went down that cliche route. Not every movie needs a baddie people! I wish **Nemo** had more things to do though. He didn't really had a character arc and was mostly there to tag along.\n\nOverall its a great 9 out of 10 from me. Love the movie.\n", "Anyone else catch the cop mouthing the words \"what the fuck?\"", "Anyone else feels that the movie's plot seemed a little rushed? It was a fantastic movie that I'd give an 8/10, but the plot felt like it couldn't fit into the length of the film.\n\nThe film would've been a potential 10/10 if it were given a longer run time to flesh out more plot points. Some of the things that I felt were rushed and compressed:\n\n- Dory's parents reunion with Dory and their roles in general were pretty insignificant despite it being the overall objective of the movie\n\n- Hank's character development also felt rather fast paced and could've been fleshed out in more detail for the audience to form a stronger sense of relation to Hank\n\n- Marlin and Nemo didn't seemed to do much the entire time (*especially* Nemo), I wish their adventure before the ending arc were more significant to the plot \n\nThese are just some of the points that stood out to me. I also felt that the movie didn't had as many memorable scenes compared to the first movie, and I blame it on the film being set mainly in the same location. The sense of adventure from the first movie didn't seem to be present in the sequel which is disappointing, but regardless the movie is still a good 8/10 for me because of how thrilling and emotional it can get.", "[deleted]", "How cute was the PIPER short at the beginning ?", "Move over, Marvel, because we have a contender for the best post-credits scene of all-time.", "\"It's your destiny, Destiny.\"", "Nemo's paranoid after being chased by that glowing giant squid really got me", "I gotta say, it was pretty awesome seeing my hometown's aquarium being the inspiration for the movie's setting.", "I have a sister with a physical and mental disability, and I have a chronic disease and this movie was incredibly touching because of that. It showed that what we may consider our disadvantages or handicaps, can really be a strength to us. That for me was really special, and I think it will touch many young children with different abilities. \n\nRegarding what some people are saying about the supporting characters disabilities being \"gags,\" I didn't feel that way. I think one of the keys for me dealing with my health issues is finding a way to laugh at it, and be not take it too seriously.

I would so love to take a time machine to when Toy Story came out and just show Pixar how far they're going to go.\n\nAnd I think it'd be really interesting to do like a side-by-side comparison of the animation from both movies.

It was entirely its own movie. The animation was stunning, the new characters were hilarious and interesting, and Dory finding her parents made the story come full circle. \n\nHowever...I did have to suspend belief. A lot. The original felt real - the dangers of the predatory fish, the mines, even Marlin and Dory riding in the pelican's beak. In this film, they do so many stunts that I was underwhelmed by the time Marlin and Nemo hopped across the fountain. At least they missed one of them. Still, the movie finished with a whale with X-Ray vision and an octopus (sorry, septopus) driving a semi...this movie had an entirely new reality. \n\nThe writing also lacked in several scenes - particularly those with Marlin and Nemo and Dory's flashbacks. I hate using this word because I'm not a cynical person, but the dialogue was flat out cheesy several times throughout the film. \n\nHonestly, I would like this better if it were a standalone film. Viewing it within the context of the original makes it feel a bit forced. Having said that, it was a solid film. If they improved on the writing, got rid of the mentally challenged sea lion that contradicted the message of the film, maintained a decent pace, and didn't have so many implausible action sequences, it would be a much better one. I feel like someone could cut out entire scenes and that alone would make it far superior. \n\nI give Dory an 8/10, all things considered.

Everyone is accepted and encouraged with the \u201cbe yourself\u201d mantra. This doesn\u2019t hold true for Hank, though, perhaps more subtly. Dory welcomes him, but does not *accept* him. In fact at the end of the movie she discusses with him about his behavior, his goals, his identity, his will, effectively condemning them as \u201cwrong\u201d and reversing his wishes.

The fishes were victims of well intentioned humans and circumstance, and it felt satisfying in its own way in how the protagonists overcame.\n\nDory really tugged at the heartstrings with her coping with her disability, and she had quite a few sad moments that really anchored the heart of this film and it was a really nice lesson on kids/adults who live with disabilities and what potential they have even with their condition.\n\nThe theater was really rooting for this film and was clapping at the end.

She would bob her head furiously saying things like \"Uh! That is so true! Just be yourself!\"\n\nI would finally like to point out that this woman was not alone.

Finding Nemo is literally my favorite movie, period, but it's mainly for its visuals, quotability, and a little nostalgia sprinkled in.

I had fun watching it, I don\u2019t think there was a character I didn\u2019t like and it was beautiful, regarding the animation, the emotion and the score. \n\nI\u2019d like to address a few things that stood out to me:\n\nFirst, the movie seemed to be fighting a good fight for mental illness awareness. It kind of said, \u201cThose with mental disabilities can do everything a person without can! They can help and they can be loved and love and they can fit into society like everyone else!\u201d Yet, Becky and the seal with the bucket (sorry, forget his name. Gerald?) were the butt of all the jokes. I think they handled Marlin\u2019s guilt wonderfully though, and Dory\u2019s parents were amazing, when it came to dealing with her issue. I just have mixed feelings on it. I\u2019m not offended by it, I just like thinking about it, but I can see others being upset by it.\n\nSecond, everything just kind of falls together at the end. It\u2019s great, because I was fearing something really sad happening to someone, but watching the movie as an adult, it just doesn\u2019t feel satisfying. And, I was a little bothered by everything surviving in fresh water lol.\n\nThird, and this is just silly, the movie comes really close to having some psychological thriller/horror undertones with Dory\u2019s flashbacks. I just want a cut of \u201cFinding Dory, if it was a horror movie\u201d but I don\u2019t have that kind of software.\n\nFourth, dammit, I didn\u2019t know there was an after credits scene. As we were leaving, my friend and I joked, \u201cWill they put, \u201cDory will return for Avengers: Infinity War\u201d? Jokes on us.\n\nLike I said, I loved it. It had its flaws, and I can\u2019t say it\u2019s better than the original but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s worse. ", "Maybe this is going out on a limb here, maybe not.  But I actually enjoyed it more than the first.  I enjoyed the characters (and the larger cast in general) more than those in Nemo, and the message behind it felt more accessible/relatable than the first film.  \n\nNot that I have anything against Finding Nemo, it's a great film.  I just think this one reached out to audiences in a way the first one didn't.  Then again, I may be biased, because I saw it with a friend who, at 23, just got hearing aids last week, and this was her first movie since getting them.  \n\nHer reactions, both to actually hearing a movie properly for the first time, and the message from the characters in the film, had her in full-on tears by the end.  It was a special moment to be there for.  Anyways, I'm getting off topic.\n\nEdit: Also, I'm really excited about Idris Elba's apparently rising career as a voice actor.  He stands out so much as a presence, that you know it's him from the first word his characters speak.  I just love the depth and inflections that he puts into his voice acting work.  I actually like it more than having him on screen, honestly.  This may be his niche going forward, and I say more power to you, Mr. Elba.  \n\nObjectively, 8/10\n\nWith emotional context, 9/10", "I had low expectations for this film going in and now I can say I'm very pleased with the results. I was worried this film would retread too much of the original or basically remake the same movie with some tweaks (looking at you, TFA). On the surface it's similar but this film is different enough. It's not as good as the original but it's a highly enjoyable film. It's better than a number of recent Pixar films, only behind Inside Out and Toy Story 3 which could be argued as being masterpieces. This feels like a Pixar film throughout. If there's one thing the film excelled at besides animation is Dory's character development. Dory is the most interesting and memorable character of Finding Nemo so exploring her character from her point of view was a good choice. I was worried that having an extremely forgettable character lead a film could get old fast but I feel Pixar managed to succeed. It felt so satisfying to see Dory feel empowered by the end. \n\nBut I think what is a strength for the film is also a weakness, that it is Dory's story. Marlin and Nemo don't do much at all. They are shown a lot but besides just being there and supporting Dory, they have little role in the film. I would've like to see Nemo be trusted with doing his own thing to help Dory and shown more that he too has grown as a character. He is with his father for nearly all of the scenes, when the first film was about him growing up. There is a parenting story that drives both films, and its in this one as well: that at some point kids must grow up and find the confidence that they can deal with whatever life throws at them. Dory is a reactionary character as opposed to the more logical Marlin and the film conveys this very well. This also makes it more interesting to watch Dory tackle situations, even if the flashbacks seem a bit too convenient at times. \n\nSome of the scenes in the film are over the top, even for Pixar standards, but if you can suspend your disbelief for a bit, the slow mo with the truck flying off into the water is amazing. I had some issues with the Octopus baby scene and the fact that they stole and could actually drive the truck down a highway. One of the things I find admirable about Pixar films are that the adults aren't stupid and that the stories feel like they could take place in our world. Having Hank be within sight of humans for a large portion of the film starts to lose that feel. But it didn't really hurt my enjoyment of the film overall. I was wondering how they'd top the Airport scene in Toy Story 2 and ultimately I think they did.\n\n9/10. A pretty good sequel overall. Could have been stronger but Dory's journey is very well done. \n\nSome thoughts: \n\nI feel that the film got much better as it went on. I don't think the earlier half was as engrossing for some reason.\n\nHank was a great character and I loved seeing him warm up to Dory, and eventually the idea of not being alone.\n\nI adored the scene with the hands poking the sea creatures and the terror that goes on there. It reminds me like the daycare scene in Toy Story 3 except we actually get to see the reactions. \n\nI would've like to have seen more of the otters. They have a pretty substantial role when you think about it, but they just decide to help Dory for whatever reason. At least in Toy Story 3, when the aliens appeared at the end you knew why and their motivations. \n\nI personally think one of the best (if not the best) scene in the movie is where Dory is told her parents are gone, then from her POV we see her ending up the in drain and ending up alone. That whole sequence is a mix of emotions. It's exhilarating and frightening at the same time. It puts Dory at the lowest point we've seen her character. \n\nI miss the feeling of exploration and seeing breathtaking shots like the original had. Just beautiful shots of the ocean filled with so much life. I feel like the film could've slowed down and shown us more of the ocean. The story is always moving toward the plot, which can be a good thing, but the setting and scenery were a huge part of the original.\n\nI was unsure of all of the weird characters at first but I loved how everything came together in the end. Similarly I loved how some of the seemingly random things Dory said like Octopus having 3 hearts or about the glasses had an explanation. \n\nThe post-credits scene doesn't make that much sense but it's still hilarious. ", "Finding Nemo was about physically finding Nemo.\nFinding Dory was about finding Dory's identity.", "Loved it. Not as good as the first one but still a lot of heart and fun to watch with my nieces\n\n\n8.5/10", "So the tank gang have been stuck inside those bags for a year? Of all the things that happen in this film, this is the strangest for me...", "I thought it was a solid enough movie. Being linked to the amazing Nemo works against it because its hard enough to make one movie that good, let alone two. Doubly difficult when Dory played quite a significant role in nemo, which made character development a little more challenging. \n\nThe disability element of the movie I thought was incredibly valuable and powerful and hope it has an impact on kids and adults alike. The title lived up to its billing... Dory was finding herself. She achieved and didn't let her disability stop her. She learned to cope. There was no magical cure. The work she and her parents put in ultimately paid off. \n\nYes there was silliness along the way but hell its a kids movie. Did they get everything right? Of course not, but on the whole I'd say they got more right then wrong.", "Not sure if anyone's gonna see this, but I just have to say:\n\nMy favorite part of the movie, hands down, was when Dory runs into Marlin for the first time. Finding Nemo was my favorite movie from my childhood, and the music that plays when Nemo is taken from Marlin is still in my brain to this day. When I heard that same music in the new movie, it really hit home and I felt like a scared little kid again.", "The amount of deus ex machina in this movie blows away anything else I've ever seen. The plot has so many holes it can barely hold fish, let alone water.\n\nThey actually had to resort to an echolocation whale that just psychically sees things then shouts important plot information into the air, whereby Dory/Marlin magically hears it no matter how far away they are (and regardless of whether they're near any pipes) and knows what to do next.\n\nMost movies involve some amount of suspension of disbelief, even if it's as basic as buying into everyone hearing what everyone else says perfectly on the first try for two straight hours.\n\nBut this was a whole other level. An octopus driving a semi? Nothing in *Finding Nemo* even approached this film's level of *deus ex acqua*.\n\nIn spite of all this I did start crying when we finally find Dory's parents and they've forlornly laid out trails of shells in the hopes of bringing her home. I will also concede that I did laugh every single time Destiny hit a wall.\n\n----\n\nFootnote: while we're on the subject of suspension of disbelief, anyone who's ever kept fish knows they die at the drop of a pin. Am I **really** supposed to believe that all those tanks, buckets, and separate bodies of water had the same pH and temperature? PLEASE. The octopus driving a truck is plausible by comparison. All the main characters should have been dead within minutes. Thanks obama.\n\n-----\n\nAlso the opening short is one of Pixar's best, it's incredible. Even if the movie was 0/10 (which it isn't), it would be worth the price of the ticket to see the short.", "This is going to be the absolute minority and I'm probably going to be downvoted to hell, but fuck it. I didn't like it. My wife and I didn't like it. Everyone else in the theater seemed to. We couldn't and the reasons are long and numerous.\n\nIt starts with the worst sequel trope, which is retreading old ground. Every scene for the first ten minutes is a retread of Finding Nemo and every joke is simply lazy. Mr. Ray with his long hooting voice that won't quit, them seeing something crazy at the reef and someone getting swept away, overprotective parents of a young disabled fish. It all felt very contrived, and I'm going to be coming back to that word a lot. None of this movie felt natural or free form in the least, but almost like a sequel created by a committee hoping to recreate the spark of the original. \n\nLet's move on to the characters. The secondary characters were not memorable, and were all pretty one note. I hate comparing sequels to their predecessors, but Finding Nemo does everything so right that it's hard not to compare. Every character in this helped them for seemingly no reason, and had little agency of their own. The octopus helps Dory because he wants the tag. Ok, but he is established to hate pretty much everything but himself, why can't he just take it from her? Because they needed a reason for her to be helped. Why do the sea lions help Nemo and Marlin? Even Marlin says that they're dangerous and eat fish! But no, they help them out, go out of their way for basically no reason. The otters at the end were the worst. They just magically plop down in front of these otters and suddenly their jumping onto a crowded free way into incoming traffic? What purpose would they have for doing this? And don't tell me this is just a kids movie. This is Pixar and they deserve to be held to a higher standard.\n\nThe major secondary characters were not memorable and were afforded little personality other than physical characteristics. The whale shark is near sighted and she knows Dory from a long time ago. That's it. The beluga whale can't do sonar, and then it can. That's it. Now this is running kind of long but I have to get this off my chest so I'll piggy back it in another comment.", "Thought it was really bad to be honest. Finding Nemo at least felt real and natural to me. I bought the world they sold. This one just didn't make sense. They were constantly out of water and swimming faster than the speed of light, etc. When the climax of your movie is an octopus driving a truck, you know you've lost all reputability. So many of the set pieces were just boring. I wanted to see more of that sunken tanker but it only ended up being a boring chase scene and that's it. Boring hallways and stuff aren't what Pixar should be using animation for yet thats the majority of the film.\n\nPlus, I just didn't like how they tried to make us want to see Nemo and Marlin go help Dory because she helped them yet they get lost immediately after and do nothing except comic relief and cliche \"oh no she was our friend and you said something mean to her!\" I mean this writing felt like it should have been on the Disney Channel or something.\n\nI also thought it was dumb how they couldn't even stick to Dory's problem. One second her memory can't hold a conversation for five seconds. Another she can talk for minutes at a time. Just didn't feel real at all.\n\nPixar is definitely not the same company that set out to make good movies. Now they solely make kid's movies. It's a shame. ", "I think this is a great sequel to Finding Nemo. It was lighter than Finding Nemo but it still has some well executed touchy-feely moment.\n\nI like the additions of the new characters. I really enjoyed Bailey and Destiny's banter. I also like Hank the Septapus and Some of the Hank and Dory scenes were good and their characters are great in fleshing each other's vulnerability.\n\nMarlin and Nemo have to go back to their backseat in this movie but both of them has their little character arc. Rudder and Fluke also provides some funny dialogue and interaction even though they had limited screen time compare to the other character.\n\nAs a sequel, I think it is was not better than Toy Story 2 & 3 but it was two steps better than Monster University and miles better than Cars 2. I would put this as one of the great Pixar sequels like Toy Story 2 and 3. I put Monsters University in the good pixar sequel and Cars 2 in subpar Pixar sequel.\n\nIn the end as a Disney Shill I would say if you and your family are looking for a good movie sequel for family to enjoy after Captain America: Civil War, then this movie is perfect for it.\n\nIn the end I would rate this in **8 out of 10**", "Great movie, but it was very much for the kids. Finding Nemo was an adult movie that kids could enjoy, and Finding Dory was a kid's movie that adults could enjoy.\n\nMy ability to relate to Gerald and Hank won me over.", "I honestly hated this movie. Most boring, unfunny garbage I've seen from Pixar possibly ever. Just felt like a movie for kids, with no jokes, story, or, characters appealing to adults whatsoever. :/", "I like it enough. I saw it at 3pm on a Friday and the theater was full of kids. Kind of fun that way.\n\nAnyway, I would have enjoyed it more if :\n\n[Spoiler](#s \"Frank had gone to Cleveland. I felt the ending was too sweet and needed some bitter. I also didn't like that they made Frank out to need that much fixing. I think that his relationship with Dory helped him be more social, but I really liked that he wanted to be alone and not be touched that much. I think a good scene of him giving Dory a big choice and then saying a strained and powerful goodbye would have been a lot cooler than the driving the truck scene. That kind of broke my suspension of disbelief a bit too much.\")\n\nOther than that it was fun and full of science-y fish facts.\nI liked that it didn't have an overtly political message like Zootopia seemed to have. I think Ellen is a great voice actress and should work more.", "Dory is one of the best representations of a disabled person I've ever seen. That stupid sea lion is one of the worst. How are those two in the same movie?!", "Did anyone else notice the Darla cameo in the first Quarantine room scene? ", "Saw it tonight, laughed more than I thought I would.  But i thought the story was oddly paced.  It never slowed down more than 5 seconds to let the audience breath and develop characters, seemed like we were always moving and there were no conflicts or obstacles for anyone that wasn't solve in one scene.", "So would Dory be like Nemo's surrogate/adoptive mother or a really weird, yet cool aunt?", "[deleted]", "Did anyone else find the portrayal of Gerald the sea lion a bit disturbing?  Gerald is a bit more anthropomorphized than the other sea lions (he has very human-like bushy eyebrows) and he looks, well, mentally retarded.  Or maybe he's just a bit \"off\" -- like that kid in grade school with poor social skills that no one wants to play with.  The other two sea lions won't let him share their rock.  I know they had to make Gerald recognizable for the joke -- the two featured sea lions' on-going antagonism towards him -- to work.  But it made me uncomfortable.  It treads a little to close the stereotype of that one kid in class who no one likes and everyone picks on.  It even felt a bit like they were picking on the mentally retarded, which was a really off note in a movie that celebrates children overcoming disabilities.", "Really great movie overall that doesn't top* the original but leaves a solid and strong impression. Visuals were beyond gorgeous.\n\nI have my complaints but most are very minor - my one big complaint though is one that's been mentioned in the thread multiple times already but I feel like sharing my own perspective on.\n\nI'm not a very PC person, but the fact that the sea lion and the bird (Gerald and Becky respectively) were basically portrayed as mentally ill or to be more blunt retarded characters - qualities which would often be exploited for laughs - bothered me. Dory's short-term memory loss is handled in a really good way in my opinion. It gives her personality and is a central part of her character and allows for lighthearted, funny moments and more heartbreaking and unfortunate ones too. It gives a holistic and purposeful treatment of her condition in a way that's organic, child-friendly, mature, and respectful. But Gerald and Becky were just \"Look at these dumb animals that are stupid and silly!\" No respect, immature, and ultimately in bad taste in my opinion. I dunno, just rubbed me the wrong way I guess. I didn't hate it, just didn't sit right with me.\n\nSuper good film though, but Pixar has definitely done better.", "To be honest I think I enjoyed the short film at the beginning of the movie more than the actual movie lol. ", "[deleted]", "I wasn't a fan of the script. It was too crazy at the end with the driving octopus, the sonar abilities, and the otters that were so willing to help. The fish were able to hop everywhere, and it seemed like whenever Dory got into trouble, a faint memory was able to get her out of trouble. I really hope Zootopia snags the Oscar this year instead of Finding Dory.", "Enjoyable. It oozes heart. Stanton ups his game for a second gut-punch opening.\n\nIt can't match the heights of \"Nemo\", though. There's a real lack of scale/adventure in comparison to the first one.\n\nI'm questioning the choice to make Dory the main star of the sequel. The fundamentals of her character disallow her from much of an emotional journey. I also found her to be much less grating as a comic relief foil than as a main character.\n\nStill, Andrew Stanton on autopilot/director's parole is still going to make a better animated movie than most.

I generally love working with as much practical as I could.", "Really feels like The Conjuring series is gonna go down as one of the premier horror classics", "A few things about this movie that stood out to me:\n\n* Firstly, the concept of spirits teleporting people. Why have I never heard of anyone doing that before? Disorientation is a great idea for horror, and as someone who's sleepwalked before (possibly out of their own house), it can be really freaky to wake up somewhere different than where you fell asleep.\n\n* Secondly, the painting scene. Hoooooly crap. I don't care if it was all a dream, it was just freaky as hell.\n\n* Thirdy: the whole sequence with Ed being blinded by steam was brilliant, but they didn't do enough with it. Now I want a horror movie shot entirely from the perspective of a person with myopia.\n\n* Fourthly: the ending made me laugh. With the last shot of the chair, I was fully expecting what Cecil from Good Bad Flicks calls a Bughuul Scare- i.e. a jumpscare at the very end of a film. Instead, it just cuts to a shot of Ed unpacking. That was kind of hilarious.", "Anyone else think of the Bill Nye theme song when he kept saying his name?", "It felt way more like Insidious than a Conjuring sequal but that isn't a bad thing.

For a sequel, it didn't feel like some \"The Warrens Go To Space\" kinda deal; but it felt like a sequel should. I loved the intro scene about the Amityville case, mainly Vera Farmiga's acting when the murders were committed. Great casting choices all around, always love seeing Farmiga and Wilson in scary movies. Loved the subtle hints to Valak's name in the Warren house (thought they were spelling their daughter's name or the family's initials tbh), but didn't like the Crooked Man. He had too much of a Babadook vibe going on.", "I am emotionally exhausted from that film.", "Anyone else impressed by that interview scene between Ed Warren and Janet with the water in her mouth?

It made me feel creeped out and uncomfortable from the very beginning. And then I got to walk home alone after at 1 in the morning and checked behind myself for a demonic nun every 30 seconds. Honestly.\n\nJames Wan is one of my favourite filmmakers going right now. He doesn't disappoint me. I really liked the tone this one took; I don't believe in ghosts and hauntings, and I really liked that this one had all the doubt, all the evidence that she was faking. For a horror movie, it's pretty on the realistic side. It's just a really good, solid film, horror genre or not. Thank god for that long runtime. It earned it.", "Anyone know how they made the Crooked Man? It looked very Babadooky and it was nuts.", "Just got back... REALLY enjoyed it.\nNot *quite* as good as the first one, but pretty fucking close. Two of the scares in here are worth the price of admission by themselves.\n\n1. The Demon Nun showing up at their house in broad daylight.\nHoly shit this scene... When the camera slides towards the painting and suddenly it looks like her actual face - I got fucking chills. I couldn't tell if I was looking at the painting or the actual demon. Incredible use of lighting there to creep the audience out.\n\n\n2. The \"IT'S MY HOUSE\" scare (you know the one)\nAgain, Wan has the balls to scare the shit out of us in broad daylight. What a fucking scare and what a buildup. It started with the remote moving, then him in the reflection, then him RIGHT BEHIND HER SHOULDER HOLY SHIT. My theater FREAKED OUT.\n\n\nThe only two moments I  didn't love were the first appearance of the Crooked Man and the banishing of the Demon Nun at the end. Both had kind of meh CGI. The Crooked Man coming out of the dog was so insanely WTF - didn't really fit with the rest of the movie in my opinion. I loved the Crooked Man's second appearance in the tent, though. That made up for it. \n\nAlso COMPLETELY loved the scene where they all turn their backs while the ghost talks. Incredible use of focus there.. I didn't notice that she had shifted to the ghost... and didn't even notice when she changed back at the end!!

In the second movie you kind of get that with Valak and Bill's ghost (although, as they explain Bill was just a pawn). \n\nTo me, I think this sort of thing makes the hauntings feel more impactful.

For example it does that thing when you look at something, stop looking for a second and come back to see something changed (e.i. with the mirror). And you just knew that the plastic truck would come back. \n\n\nHowever, overall the film is actually great and a true piece of art. It has excellent cinematography and really original shots. The increased budget is evident, such as in the use of Bird's eye shots. I particularly like it's use of long takes. It doesn't cut mercilessly like Hollywood blockbusters. Furthermore, the costumes and set design were perfect.\n\nOriginally, while watching it, I was let down by the Bill Wilkins. I thought that while he was a good villain they should have made him more menacing and waited to reveal him physically until the climax, like in Jaws or The Bababook. After the people left due to Janet faking the incident, I just thought that the Warrens would realize something was up, come back and stop the spirit in the nick of time, kind of like in the first one. I was surprised by the twist because I had originally assumed that the nun was being set up for The Conjuring 3.\n\nThere was a craft to the scares. Sure it used jump scares, but it was also creative. For example, in the scene in flooded basement, when Bill Wilkins is heading for Ed but then disappeared, I originally thought that they were just building up the suspense so I was left completely off guard when the actual jump scare happened.", "Got back from the film a while ago and aside from the goofy Crooked Man, I loved it. For a 135 minute long film, it never felt that long, and Wan uses the runtime to his advantage. The characters are beautifully written and very well-developed, a huge plus in any horror film. They have personalities, they have weaknesses, they have strengths, they have genuine depth. These characters felt like real people and I was able to get emotionally invested in them and care about them. The performances are all fantastic. Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson are both great as always and Frances O'Connor is also very good. The standout is Madison Wolfe as Janet. Wolfe's performance was excellent. Honestly, some of the best child acting I've ever seen in a horror film.\n\nI also loved how Wan built up the tension and suspense and created atmosphere. This is a filmmaker that manages to incorporate jump scares into his films, something that I usually hate, and yet they work in his films, because they are real. They are not false scares. They are genuine. Especially helping is Wan's trademark fluid camerawork and Don Burgess' beautiful cinematography. Wan works wonders behind the camera and he & Burgess give the film a very slick and stylish look. The music by Joseph Bishara is also very high on the scale of effectiveness.\n\nBut the best parts of this movie for me aren't even the scares, a lot of which are great. The best parts were the more emotional scenes, both touching and serious/dramatic. I especially love the moments between Ed and Lorraine. You really get invested in these two and Farmiga & Wilson have wonderful chemistry with one another. They're just so enjoyable to watch on screen. In fact, I'd actually like to see James Wan make a straight-up drama. That's how good those scenes were in this film.\n\nIf I have any complaints, I didn't like the Crooked Man. I didn't really find him scary and the look of him is just goofy, along with the poorly rendered CGI for him. But the rest of the film was so good that he didn't bother me too much in the long run. This is a sequel that, to me, is just as good if not better than the first film.", "I'm not sure if anyone else noticed. \n\nBut the demon's name was spelt out in bookshelf in the scene where Loraine is ready the bible with her daughter in the room. \n\nI also think the name also appeared in the kitchen when Loraine is talking to Ed about stopping cases.\nThat one maybe not be a 100% thing. \nThere were letters on their wall, but after a fast glance at the letters I didn't pay attention to it.

James Wan, he is the premier horror director of the millennium. Saw, Insidious Franchise (which I don\u2019t even love) and The Conjuring series. \n\nThe camera work is amazing. I loved an early sequence where the camera zoomed in the many rooms of the house and up the stairs while the family walked around.

And almost every scene was angled to maximized terror and of course quite a lot of longer shots.\n\nI don\u2019t think it is as good as the [first one](http://gorgview.com/the-conjuring), but it is still quit scary over all.

The plot overall was more interesting to me than the somewhat generic haunted house story of the first one.

Also, the scenes with that wholesale version of slender man, called the crooked man or something, seemed like pointless pandering. The crooked man character design was cool, but it just felt like it didn't fit. Seemed a little forced.

Hope we get a third!", "Watched it last week at an advanced screening. I would say I liked the story of the first one better, but found this one scarier and more intense, at least on a first watch.\n\nThere are quite a few cliches in this film, however I think the overall quality of the movie outweighs the flaws with plot. The characters and performances are really good, and the girl that played Janet Hodgson was outstanding.\n\nThe production design was also great. The house was sufficiently creepy in its own right, the costumes were on point and accurate to the photos of the 'real' haunting.\n\nAnother flaw was the use of CGI. The CGI in the first film was minimal and unnoticeable from my point of view, but in this film there are 2 fully CG characters that look incredibly cheesy compared to the more realistic practical effects.\n\nOverall it's an outstanding example of a horror sequel done right. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the first film.", "The director really shines at the climax of the movies. The first conjuring was a thrill ride at the final climax as well.

Just got back from it, and I'm very glad I got to see it opening night. The cinematography was incredible and beautiful. Loved all the overhead shots and continuous shots that went through walls and windows. I really liked Ed and Lorraine again, they're both great characters. Although, I do think Ed was much more skeptical than he was in the first one, and it just seemed a little forced with how narrow-minded he was. My feeling is that he would've had enough proof for himself to believe them. The movie didn't seem to plateau, it never stopped being interesting to me, but at a certain point, there was a repetition of paranormal instances and then just moving onto the next instance. So it kept the same level of intensity, but not a continual rise in intensity, to the climax. And I also think I should've avoided the trailers and images in the ads, because a lot of the iconic moments of the movie, I'd seen already. Even though they were really good! The girl did a great job too! One thing I blatantly didn't like was the babadook slender man. I thought for sure it was a dream sequence, but it was actually happening in their reality. It reminded me of the stop motion from James and the giant peach and not world realistic to me. Kinda took me out of it. I had a lot of fun with the movie though. I loved the long take of Ed and Bill conversing. So cool. And the beginning of Lorraine going around the house as the possessed guy was wicked too. Reminded me a ton of the out-of-body experiences from Insidious. The climax was very good and once again, the camera work was top notch!

What made this movie succeed in ways others haven't, is that I am not sure I could breathe during the movie because it was so oppressive.

The movie succeeded because Wilson and Farmiga play the loving couple of faith who have complete faith in each other and in God that what they are doing is right.

I give it at least a 9 out of 10", "So was I the only one who was not scared at all when the Crooked Man showed up?", "Liked this a lot, but one thing was super out of place and it almost derailed the movie for me.\n\nWan is a master of the language of horror, and this film and the one preceding it both show that. He's got an enviable and rare level of control over every facet of the film and uses it to build tension with finesse. But his wheelhouse has always been very literal horror. In *The Conjuring*, everything we're witnessing is actually happening. There actually is a witch/demon that's haunting this house and was perched on the cupboard. Lorraine actually is having these visions of a presence in the house. The mother actually is possessed and vomiting blood.\n\nLikewise, the first third of this film is literal. The spirit occupying the house was actually sitting in that chair, was actually next to the television, was actually moving the furniture. Everything about the way it was shot and presented to the audience conveys that literalism - this is all real. But the film then spends a sizable chunk of its runtime having characters question \"is all this real?\"\n\nWhich in and of itself is fine - there's something to be said for having characters question the reality of a situation, especially when the director is using it to set up a situation where the protagonists, fully believing in the reality of their situation, are at odds with those who are able to help them. It puts the audience on the side of those who believe. But because the Warrens take so long to fully commit to the goings on in the home, and because they have a moment of doubt, it places us at odds with them, and doesn't convincingly pivot to the family to have us identify with them instead of the newly skeptical Warrens.\n\nThe Warrens, especially given the plot with the demon nun, are the center of this film in a way they arguably weren't in the original. Whereas they were the Ghostbusters called in to save the family in the original, this film's conflict is unique rooted in their own lives and history. So for us to spend a large portion of the film at odds with them - in a position where what we know to be true based on the way the film presented it to us is being doubted by the characters we're supposed to identify with - felt waaaay off to me, and took me out of the film a few times.\n\nI understand that the idea that it was all a hoax is a significant part of the real-world Enfield haunting case, but because Wan shot everything so literally, the idea that it might be a hoax fell flat for me.\n\n", "bill bill bill bill....bill nye the science guy?", "HE...

The whole demonic child speaking like a gown man was just silly and is so overused that I couldn't help but crack a laugh.

But as a hardcore lore nerd, I'm really confused at some of the changes they made.  I get changing Thralls origins, it makes Draka and Durotan seem a lot more heroic, but some of it was just weird.  I don't think Lothar needed a son, I feel like it could've just been his soldiers under his command and maybe a personal apprentice.

Lothar is supposed to be the lead Alliance character but he was mostly chilling in the back seat.  Duratan was a stronger lead and connected more with me with his problems.  Even at the most tragic event to him, Lothar failed to deliver any emotions or significance of the scene.\n\nI think they should have made Khadgar be the lead since he was a total noob.

They nailed Guldan", "Did anyone catch the characters in the Blizzard intro?", "I really hated how the Orcs didn't drink the blood of mannoroth.  That's to show how the orcs chose their own destructive destiny and is the basis of Groms redemption.

Easy peasy", "I enjoyed the film for the most part. Orcs were great, CGI was fine, all the lore-stuff was cool. I've been playing since Warcraft 1, so I am very much looking forward to this becoming a whole franchise. This was a shaky start, but hopefully the overseas gross will help boost it into a success.\n\nI had a few nitpicks that I'd like to share, just to air them out. I felt the movie made some really odd character and story choices. Like, why make Khadgar a dropout of the Kirin Tor? That some weirdly unnecessary background. How would his character or the movie have been any different if he was a mage in good standing with the Kirin Tor? Though I am pleased that he didn't randomly turn into an old man at the end. That is one lore correction I am very happy with.\n\nBut Lothar's son should have been completely cut from the film. It just gave Lothar more baggage than he needed. He already had half a dozen different reasons to be in this movie and to fight the orcs, he didn't need a backstory with a son. The movie didn't explore it well enough to warrant the son.\n\nBut my biggest gripe is how weirdly the movie handled the ending. I enjoyed the big fight, and the showdown with Durotan was great. But I am baffled at how the movie set itself up to have a perfect ending, but then shot itself in the foot on several occasions that just make no sense. Hear me out. \n\nSo with nothing left to lose, Durotan challenges Gul'Dan to ancient combat, and he makes it pretty clear that his goal is to show his fellow orcs how far Gul'Dan has fallen, how he has given in to darkness \u2014 and he succeeds! Durotan sacrifices his life to show his fellow orcs that Gul'Dan has abandoned honor for dark magic, and Orgrim Doomhammer leads the accusations that they should all turn away from Gul'Dan...except Gul'Dan simply kills a couple orcs and everybody falls back in line. Durotan died for nothing. But it doesn't end there.\n\nSoon after, the King sacrifices himself to put Garona into a position of power among the orcs...except there is no power vacuum, because Gul'Dan is still alive. So it's not like she can take charge or anything. Then, after Lothar kills Blackhand, Gul'Dan, FOR A SECOND TIME, starts trying to defy tradition and honor by trying to go after Lothar. And what does Garona do with her new position of power? She saves Gul'Dan's life by stopping him from doing something rash! \n\nAnd the movie ends with the villain not only still alive, but still in control of an army of orcs as determined as ever to kill the humans. Nothing has been settled. Nothing has been finalized. Durotan died for nothing. \n\nTwice, the movie presented a perfectly sound option where the honorable orcs turn against and defeat Gul'Dan because he has abandoned tradition. That way, the bad guy is defeated, Fel is rejected, Garona is in a position of power, Durotan and the King's sacrifices mean something and the movie has a solid ending. But twice they shot themselves in the foot.\n\nIt's just baffling. Anyway, that's my little rant. Thanks for reading.

Thought Travis Fimmel stood out along with Patton for acting, especially given their heavily CGI-laden scenes.

When the Orcs fought one another, it was like two freight trains colliding. But when they fought one of the actors, suddenly their blows were being blocked by casually swung swords, or an 900-pound Orc gets foot-swept by a tiny human.

He is the greatest magician in the land, but he has cut himself off, feeling apart from the world he serves.\n* Khadgar is a young and inexperienced mage given to the Kirin Tor as a child (the mage collective of this world), who was studying to potentially one day replace Medivh. However, he felt uneasy with his lot in life and chose to walk away, breaking his oaths to the Kirin Tor. He still wants to serve the people of Azeroth, but he doesn't want to keep the world at arms length like the Kirin Tor do.\n* Lothar is the champion of the kingdom of Stormwind, their greatest warrior and military leader. He has a contentious relationship with his son Callan, whose mother died during childbirth. He's powerful but to an extent he's aimless in his life, serving the people of Stormwind because that's what a person in his position does, not because he's figured out what his path in life will be, at least not yet.\n* King Llayne Wrynn is the idealistic if a bit naive peacetime leader of his people. He rules a kingdom that has been at peace with the other races of his world. He's a compassionate and good hearted leader who has no reference point for the invasion that is coming his way. His Queen is Lothar's sister with whom he has a son, Varian Wrynn, who will one day grow up to be a leader who combines the best qualities of his father with the best qualities of Lothar.\n\n**Orcs:**\n\n* Gul'Dan is the warlock leader of the collective orcish Horde. He draws his magic from the life force of beings around him, trading their lives to enhance the brutish nature of the orcs and turning their skin green with fel magic. He is the one who leads the orcs from their native world of Draenor, a land his magic has all but killed, into the world of Azeroth, the world of the humans.\n* Durotan is the chieftain of the Frostwolf clan, one of many orcish clans who had united under Gul'Dan's leadership. Durotan is a noble leader who holds to the traditions of the Horde and who wants to create a better life for his unborn son.\n* Draka is the wife of Durotan and the mother of Go'el, who will grow up to become the great leader of the orcs known as Thrall. She is a fierce warrior in her own right, although the movie focuses on her as a mother and wife.\n* Orgrim Doomhammer is the right hand man of Durotan, a legendary warrior among the Frostwolf who holds to the old ways. He is guided by tradition even more so than his chieftain, and he struggles with what he believes is right and what he believes it means to be an orc.\n* Garona Halforcen. In this telling, she is the daughter of a human male and an orc woman, an outcast among the Horde whose literal name means \"cursed\" in their tongue. Her mother was murdered for no other reason than giving birth to such a weak creature, and she owes her survival only to Gul'Dan, who took her in even though he treated her as a slave.\n* Blackhand the Destroyer is Gul'Dan's right hand man and the current Warchief of the Horde, the commander of their armies in battle. He is himself the chieftain of the Blackrock Clan, a ruthless yet very traditional leader who follows Gul'Dan because that's what orcs do, they follow the strongest among them and they hope to fight the fiercest battles available to them.\n\nIf you read that, you'll get a lot more enjoyment out of the movie. A 2 hour runtime was not enough time to set up all of this and it suffers because of this, but if you know the players and their starting points, there's at the very least a good movie in there, potentially a great one. I hope the Director's Cut adds more to this story and gives it time to breathe, especially early on where it feels entirely too crowded and choppy. This movie is only the beginning of the story, and it has no clear cut answers for you. There's very little in terms of moral absolutism, and few are beyond redemption.

I didn't give a shit of WoW in years but this has me a little hype for the new expansion. I would love to see more of the other races in a sequel. ", "That was the most solid 5/10 movie I've ever seen. There was nothing wrong with it from an objective stand point, but none of the characters or events were actually memorable. Sure, it was fun to watch, but I'll forget almost all of it within a week,", "I would say to watch in the theater just for the Orcs. I give 8/10 to the Orc parts (cgi, characterization, etc). The human parts fell super flat to me so that is 2/10. The story, pacing and lack of development is 5/10. So in short, I think that the movie is a 5/10 which to me is average movie but I would watch this in theaters.", "This movie to me is such a mix bag. On one hand, as a long time Warcraft fan, I had been hyped for this forever and to finally see these places as they'd exist in real is really fun. However, I think if you're just a general person, this movie should leave you feel like there were a ton of plot holes. This reminds me of the Hobbit because everything is crammed in, no part of the story is given enough time to develop and things are just sort of happening. Hopefully the 40 mins they cut out can fill out those plot holes because the movie itself is fun as hell to watch. ", "I played WoW with my son over that last 10 years off and on. I liked the film a great deal as it touched on concepts and parts of the lore we had been immersed in while playing.\n\nMy biggest let-down was that none of the music score from the games was used. The music in WoW has always and still is some of my most favorite music. The scores bring such emotion that when listening to any of the scores that play at the login screen you can close your eyes and envision these amazing trials and conflicts between the races.\n\nI understand the film was not 'about' the things that happen in much of the WoW expansions but the music has always been so hauntingly beautiful. It was truly missed here.\n\nJust my opinion.", "I absolutely *loved* this movie. It's not anywhere near perfect but it does more things right. Even despite its issues there is a strong story being told. The people behind the film clearly understand Warcraft. A lot of blockbusters feel hollow or only resemble the original in name only, but this one tried so hard to do the source material justice. Ultimately I feel it succeeded. Most of the problems have to do with the movie's length and execution. I have rarely enjoyed a movie as much as this one, but that's because I was already invested in the characters and world. So it's hard for me to give it a numerical rating, since as a fan I'd give it an 8 or 9 out of 10 but realistically it falls in the 6 or 7 out of 10 range. \n\nThe good stuff:\n\nThe CGI, particularly the Orcs, are incredible. Really enjoyed how visually interesting spells were depicted on screen.\n\nThe settings were so intriguing I wish we had more time to explore Ironforge, Dalaran, and the streets of Stormwind. \n\nThe level of attention to detail is stunning. I feel like I have to watch this film multiple times to fully appreciate everything.\n\nThe Orcs not being portrayed as evil, and even as they follow Gul'dan they remain committed to upholding their culture and traditions. In this film they are people and a joy to watch. \n\nThe score was quite good. A cut above the generic action movie score while still maintaining that Warcraft feel.\n\nThe scene with the sheep is the best scene in the movie. \n\nGul'dan was better than I expected. I completely hated him and that's a good thing.\n\nAll of the fan easter eggs. \n\nThe action sequences are amazing.\n\nSome issues:\n\nThe pacing as many have mentioned, especially in the first act. We absolutely should not be walking through the Dark Portal in the first few minutes. We at least should have more time spent with Durotan, the Orcs way of life, and the current state of Draenor. Then the story just drops you in Azeroth and takes off running. I can see how those unfamilar with the lore would be lost during these parts.\n\nTelling instead of showing. I know approximately 40 minutes was cut from the film and it shows. Characters explaining their backstories in front of a campfire, while effective, just isn't as interesting as it could be. I understand they had to make some compromises due to run time but explaining backstories/motivations could've been stronger.\n\nLothar vs. Blackhand. There was already a lot going on but I would've been more satisfied if it wasn't over so quickly.\n\nGarona's costume. She appeared far too human and the fangs looked cheap and distracting. Unlike many, I thought her character and acting were fine and that she was legitimately interesting. But comparing her to Draka her design leaves much to be desired. \n\nI wasn't a big fan of the scene of Khadgar and the cube. It just felt so out of nowhere, had too many generic lines, and I wanted Khadgar to prove without help that Medivh was bad news and get people to take him seriously.\n\nThe script could've definitely been stronger. For a lot of minor characters (for example, the scene with the meeting with the Dwarfs and Elves) dialogue is extremely cut down to just stating the point to save time. \n\nI was so invested toward the end that I didn't want the film to end. If only the film had more screentime to fully develop the first half of the film, then it would be a legitimately great film all around. Hopefully a director's cut will help with that. \n\n\n", "As someone who doesn't play video games, doesn't read fiction, only watches documentaries and listens to NPR.

I will definitely be buying this film.", "I feel like this is the summary:\n\nPerson who is warcraft fan: Awesome\n\nPerson who is not warcraft fan: Okay \n\nPerson who takes movies and themselves way to seriously:Horrible\n\nA decent movie that is made much better if you enjoy the lore. \n\n", "The BIG fight scene with Durotan was great and I thought it would influence the orcs but nah...5 seconds later they are back with Guldan", "Alright, it's a crap movie and I enjoyed myself tremendously while watching it.

Fine by me, make another one.", "Never again will I read a review of a movie on The Guardian or Rotten Tomatoes site-an absolute embarassment.  It wasn't a review-it was just a pointless ramble of absolute garbage.\n\nThe movie wasn't a 10/10 by any means, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  Having bits cut from the movie was a bit of a mistake though, as it led to confusion with some people which is understandable.  For some reason though, if you go on some Blizzard gaming forums, if you say you like the movie or recommend it-you're instantly downvoted which is pretty sad.  It's okay to not like a movie....I get that.  But for being criticised for basically saying \"If you like the look of it give it a go\" is a sorry state of affairs.  It's like theirs people out there hating for hating sake because agenda reasons.\n\nI give the movie a solid 8 though and I look forward to the sequel as I've invested myself in the movie.  By no means perfect-but fun and a great way to escape into my favorite universe for a couple of hours.\n\nAlso on a sidenote, although I've ALWAYS played Alliance, the movie has made me see the Horde in a different light", "I think this film is getting an unfair amount of hate directed at it.  It is by no means a great film, it's mediocre to okay at best, but when compared to other videogame films it certainly holds its own.  I went into this expecting to groan and grimace at poor dialog, overuse of CGI and a weak story.  I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw.  I loved the diversity and depictions of magical spells; I don't think I've ever seen a movie portray magical attacks and defenses so fantastically. I don't recall ever being bored or rolling my eyes at any of the dialog and the fight scenes were well produced.\n\nCharacter development was rushed at times, certain twists were easily anticipated and motivations seemed a little forced for some characters, but over all I thought it wasn't a terrible mess like I assumed when I saw the trailers.  \n\nCould it have been better? Absolutely. Was it a horrific pile of shit like the critics would have you believe? I don't think it was.  It was okay, a solid flick if you like cool effects and fantasy movies with magic and monsters.  As long as you don't expect it to have the depth and quality of the LOTR trilogy, it's okay.  I think it might have been better than the hobbit trilogy, but maybe only by a little bit. ", "Good bad and ugly: (Spoilers beware)\n\nGood: the CGI is so well done, im not entirely convinced i didnt watch orcs just act in a movie.\n\nThe orcs. You sympathize with them. Most films either cant or dont do this, but warcraft does. Their motivations are clear, Gul'dan is after power, the others moatly just want what is best for them and their people, it differs what they think that is.\n\nThis world genuinely feels like Azeroth. Ironforge looked like Ironforge, Stormwind looked like Stormwind. It was just so well done.\n\nContinuity. Dalaran floats and it shouldnt, but other than that there arent any major plot elements that were changed.\n\nThere was enough fan service where i enjoyed it, without it being too hamfisted, and without being obnoxiously overboard like Force Awakens.\n\nThe fights. My god, they were amazing. Orcs fought like these big, heavy monsters, humans were athletic, nimble, and quick. \n\nAttention to detail. Jesus H Christ that stormwind guard looked exactly like a stormwind guard. The world in the MMO and the world in the movie really felt one in the same.\n\nThe movie doesnt stick to Tolkein cliches. The wizard isnt this ancient all powerful being. Khadgar is this nerdy kid. The king isnt commanding nor does he have a presence. It does its own deal with the characters. I know thats just lore. But literally every goddamn fantasy movie has the same cliches and warcraft nixed them.\n\nThe bad: Fourty minutes were cut from the movie and it shows. The pacing is quick from start to finish and i wish they just kept the extra scenes.\n\nI didnt like Garona as a character. Her orc accent was awful, at the end when shes yelling at Gul'Dan, that shouldve either been Grommash or Ogrim.\n\nDominic Cooper looked uncomfortable in his own skin. Im not entirely sure this belongs in the bad though and ill explain why. During Llanes rule, theres really not a lot of trouble until the orcs showed up. He spends his rule as king of an unimaginably wealthy nation with no real enemies. He knows about feeding the hungry, and making the wealth of his kingdom known with his outlandishly dressed army (thats why everything looks so ridiculous on the human side. They have tons and tons and tons of money, so they make shields that look like lion heads). If a king with that track record was thrown into the issues he was, hed probably feel the same way.\n\nThe Ugly: i didnt absolutely hate anything about this film. Although i really think had they left the 2hour 40minute version in tact, wed be discussing how it was better than Civil War. Pacing will hurt it, other than that, very enjoyable.\n\nOverall, i give it a 7/10. Its not great, but worth a visit to the cinema if you like fantasy movies. Im very excited to see the directors cut when it comes out on bluray. ", "One thing I really liked about it was how large everything seemed to be. The aesthetic of Warcraft has always been an exaggeration of features from characters to architecture, and I think the style here really nailed that. Tomes looked thick, armor was broad, weapons were large, even stuff like chairs and tables seemed kind of enlarged. I really enjoyed that about the movie and it made it feel more like Warcraft to me.", "Overall, really enjoyed the movie. The Horde was done really, really well in my opinion. Aside from Gul'Dan who I feel could've done with a more intimidating voice similar to the one he has in the games. The orcs in general were characterized pretty well, and their dialogue was awesome overall. On a semi-related note, I really loved Grom constantly showing up in the background towards the end of the movie with Gorehowl.\n\nThe humans on the other hand... Did anyone else feel that there was a lot of miscasting and cheesy if not outright awkward dialogue?", "Just saw the movie. Orcs were epic. Durotan, orgrim,  and gul'dan...damn. Medivh magicing was amazing.", "Best Video Game movie I have ever seen", "My friend made a very astute observation while watching the film. \n\nGul'dan sounds **EXACTLY** like the College Humour Batman. ", "Could anyone tell me why the movie was cut so short? The director has said that a films worth of scenes were cut. Why wouldnt a story that is as epic as they are trying to portray be cut to such a short film. The first LoTR movie was 3h 48m and there were very few complaints of it being too long. Wouldn't a longer Warcraft film provide the time necessary for Jones to give the depth and allow for the pace that is criticized so much?", "Saw it! loved it! not dissapointed will see again in Imax 3d", "Just got done watching. There was poor pacing, but the numerous nods and interesting action sequences made the film enjoyable.\n\nI give it a Keeper of the Grove out of a Tauran. \n\nI think many of the movie's strengths were \"shown, not told.\" The nods to the: RTS games via perspective shift, polymorph spell, infernal tease, various cameos, accuracy to detail, and etc. Note that these are things a super fan would enjoy but would be lost on laymen. Despite being a super fan, I found the breaks in lore were more than acceptable. Warcraft lore is exceptionally messy, so these small changes for the sake of consistency later makes sense.\n\nIn terms of weaknesses: the character chemistry/development was AWOL, and there was too many brief expositional scenes. Other than Durotan and Lothar, no-one seemed to have any personality. I am more than willing to expend exposition (and even character plot lines) for the sake of character development. Warcraft stories are character driven, so those characters need to be up to snuff.", "My take on the whole movie. I loved it! I took my friends to see it and the only problem was the movie jumps right into the battle. No background is given like who is the horde and who are the alliance. Put it this way.. try putting all of Game of Thrones in one movie. I can't be done. HBO, Showtime, Starz or Netflix should pick up the rights and make it into a well produced tv show. That can engage it's watchers and help them understand the story. I loved it though. \n ", "Loved it. They did a great job of making Warcraft come to life. Can't wait to see some sequels.", "Enjoyable enough. No worse than a typical billion dollar comic book movie.", "This is one of those slightly above average movies that I tremendously enjoyed, right now I'd give it a 6/10. I really wanna see the directors cut because the missing 40 minutes makes the pacing jarring.", "My perspective as a Warcraft fan but also movie snob: better than expected. The CGI was killer and I really appreciated the stuff for players like the murloc, fishing bobber, architectural accuracy, etc. Acting wasn't perfect but better than I thought going in. Bad aspects were probably the script and pacing. Certain points it seemed like 3-5 lines before a new scene began for several scenes in a row. It was kind of off-putting. I give it a 6/10. \n\nMy wife knew basically nothing about the lore going in, and she really enjoyed herself; really surprised me how much she liked it in a sit back and enjoy, don't worry about the plot holes kind of way. To be fair she tends to like fantasy stories in general so YMMV with your friends and family. She singled out Garona and Khadgar as favorites.", "I thought this movie was fucking epic. \n\nThe opening with introduction of the portal and seeing Guldan with the music blasting was really amazing. \n\nI agree that the human characters felt weak, but that's fixable in a second movie. \n\nOrcs were amazing and Durotan's story took me on a feel trip. \n\nI'd give the movie an 8/10 honestly. I'm a lil biased since I played WoW from vanilla to lich and then the RTS games. \n\nOnly thing missing was some gnomes :-( If I had seen a gnome I would of given the movie a 10.

Definitely need some improvement with the dialogue.  The plot is one of the weaker story lines in the this universe IMO.  I'm hoping for a sequel.

The magic was really legit too. Action scenes were fun. \n\nDidn't like the forced romantic subplot. Dialogue was also pretty cringy. Also, why was Ragnar playing Ragnar? ", "I'm not a Warcraft fan, but I want to be. I've become familiar with some of the characters from Heroes of the Storm, and I wanted to like this film.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't stick the landing. I feel like a director's cut could easily save this film, because its biggest problems are editing and pacing. The editing in the film is *atrocious*. The way the shots are cut together has no rhythm and often feels abrupt and jarring.\n\nI remember a specific scene where someone says something that catches Garona's attention. Can't remember what it was for the life of me, but I remember there's a shot of her turning around as the line sinks in, and it's meant to convey that she's invested in whatever's being talked about, but the shot cuts away so quickly that the effect doesn't sink in for the audience.\n\nWe also have a scene with Gul'dan praising the Frostwolves clan and saying their second-in-command who sold out Durotan is a pretty awesome guy. Second-in-command is like \"Yo give me like ten minutes and I'll get them on your side (paraphrased).\" There's then a brief scene with the humans, and we immediately go back to the Frostwolves tribe being genocided. I understand that Gul'dan's just kinda an asshole and this works in his character, but the audience doesn't get to *see* him deciding to kill them anyway and it just ends up with a really jarring cut to orcs killing each other for reasons that aren't immediately obvious.\n\nThe film also had some issues with exposition. It wasn't clear to me what Medivh's role in the world was. Okay, he was the Guardian, but uh...what does the Guardian do exactly? Who are the Kirin Tor? \n\nUltimately, I think every single one of these problems can be fixed in a director's cut, and I can easily see how 40 minutes of footage being sliced out for the theatrical cut would cause all of them. There is a good movie somewhere in here, but right now the version in theaters is pretty bad.\n\nedit: typo", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I was familiar with the name Warcraft, but didn't know much of the lore going into this. I liked the trailer and I'm into fantasy movies so I gave it a shot. Not bad in my opinion. It did feel a little rushed. I thought the actor who played Khadgar could have been more charismatic. I thought the movie lost some weight so to speak because they focused more on setting up the next movie than just letting this one stand on its own. But, overall a decent movie. Not warranting the bad reviews it's getting. Especially relative to video game movies. But, since I put it that way, it's probably the best live action video game movie ever made. What's better? The first Mortal Kombat? The first Tomb Raider?", "All of my Warcraft friends and I enjoyed it. That being said, I know the lore and the characters, and I don't need as much introduction to them, whereas the average moviegoer definitely does. Yes, you can clearly figure out who's an asshole and who's a good guy, but still.\n\nThis is one of the rare cases that a movie should have been longer. Everything about it felt rushed; scene transitions, pacing, character development. I think this was cut to 100 minutes? This should have been AT LEAST 120 minutes.\n\nEchoing what others have said, I'm holding out for a Director's Cut which fleshes things out even more. Give me that cut and I'll be happy.\n\nI will say, HOLY SHIT THIS MOVIE LOOKED AMAZING. Like, for real, that's some of the best CGI I think I've ever seen. Also, DEMON HYPE.", "I can see why a lot of critics or people that are really into movies hate it. It's VERY Warcraft, in that it captures all the cheesy, tropey, mishmash of fantasy elements. I saw one review call it a parody of fantasy as a slight against the movie.. but that's exactly what Warcraft is, in essence, and I don't think it should be ashamed of that.\n\nThe first 20 minutes of the movie were ALL over the place, location and story-wise. There was a severe lack of 'filler' or story-building scenes, and I thought Travis Fimmel phoned it in as Lothar, playing him as a sort of watered-down Ragnar, but all the other characters I greatly enjoyed.

I felt a bit of the acting was pretty bad too and mostly on the human side of things. Lothar and his son story felt unconvincing.  Garona was my least liked character. Khadgar was a good idea and i like how the character was portrayed but i felt a slight cringe every time a spell was cast. and the movie trailed on at the end, I felt it was a case of too much story. I'll end on a high note though since I enjoyed it. The orcs were fucking awesome from start to finish. All of the CG held up really well.

I think part of that was my knowledge of that universe starts at WoW, which this takes place before, and somewhat during. From what I understand the movie kind of jumbled up the timeline. \n\nThat said, I liked it. I thought the opening Orc sequence looked too CGI'd, but after awhile I did feel like to Orcs were real. The establishing shots of the major cities were awesome, and the little Easter eggs were fun (the murloc, Khagdar leveling up, etc.). I thought the fights were done well, and I enjoyed the film.

I really, really want to see that sequel. Thrall is a strong character, and if they get another chance, hopefully they can learn from what they did poorly here and make a great sequel. I'll buy it, I'm in. \n\nI'm not a warcraft expert, but the lore seemed solid.

I don\u2019t want to feel like I watched episode 1, give me a complete tale with some hints into the future. The CGI wasn\u2019t consistent throughout. There was a particularly bad scene when The Guardian fell into his pool and it started turning green. It felt really off and not up to par with the rest of the film.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t all bad! In fact, the action I LOVED. It is WARCraft after all. The best part about the action, outside of how plenty the fight scenes are, is that every fight you can clearly understand what is happening. We don\u2019t have blurry action with our mind filling in the blanks. We can see every crush, smash, and slash and it makes for a good time.\n\nAnd the subtle references to WoW and previous games felt really good. That polymorph was amazing.

It gives no fucks, for better or worse. It's definitely a kids movie but it throws a few bones to the adults. Is it a must see? No. But I think turtle fans should be much happier with this one. I had a good time. More importantly, the kids in the audience had a good time. \n\nI'd say the first third was fun, a chunk in the middle was very boring, and the last third was fun again. Megan Fox was sort of bland. Bebop stole the show. I couldnt help but smile whenever Krang was onscreen.\n\nThanks to the first movie, a lot of people have already made up their mind about this one before seeing it and watching it they'll only be looking for reasons to reaffirm that point of view.

Shredder doesn't fight anyone at all. And Krang is only in the first and last 15 min. I would have loved to see the 4 villains face the 4 heroes in an epic fight in the technodrome, exchanging quips and one liners in the process, and maybe have Raph break the fourth wall as he's known to do time to time. And the lack of hand to hand combat was disappointing. This is a movie about ninjas, don't need to see explosions and crashes. \n\nThe personalities were spot on, and definitely carried what was a poorly paced movie. Krang steals the show, he is freaking hilarious. \n\nI enjoyed it though. Turtle power!

The lack of plot, terrible script, shitty acting, terrible editing and all the other problems would have been fine if they had some badass fight scenes and choreography but there is nothing. The first movie at least had a couple of those but this is just bereft of action fight scenes. Do the writers and director really think we want to see them tracking people and objects the whole movie? They don't fight the Foot Clan AT ALL. Shredder has no fight scene. With Bebop and Rocksteady they just stumble around grappling. The final fight with Krang is just them dodging all his random attachments until the very end when they do one move to finish him off. You never get to see them be badass ninjas taking care of business. It was insanely disappointing and I could not recommend this movie to anyone unless they have a toybox full of Ninja Turtles. \n\nI really don't understand how no one else is mentioning this. The original movies had more and better fight scenes with those clunky suits. I can't stress enough how much it takes away from the movie not having them be...ninjas.

I wasn't expecting much when I saw the first one, and enjoyed that, so I was happy to see this one too. Obviously I'm not expecting the height of cinema here, but for a Michael Bay live-action version of an 80s cartoon, this does everything it needs to. It was a good runtime, the tension between the brothers was good, I like the general storyline of \"oh this things have to be collected and then there'll be a thing we have to stop.\" Some of the scenes are really cool.\n\nMy biggest problem with it honestly was Stephen Amell. I don't watch Arrow, but I have friends that went to this just to see him, and I don't know if they were happy or not. I thought he was pretty bad.

I also must be in the minority who was glad Shredder wasn't overused. Hrs probably being built up and saved for a 3rd film.\n\nMy only complaints: The Turtles didn't have any real hand-to-hand combat scenes, and Casey Jones was awful. Too clean cut and happy. Hoping they're building him up for a sequel too.\n\nI recommend re co to anyone who liked the original cartoon and the '14 film. Gave it a 7/10", "It was okay. Mikey, Donnie, Raph, Bebop, and Rocksteady were great. Leo, Casey, Baxter and April were played horribly. Krang looked great but I wasn't a fan of the VA. Shredder and Karai felt as wasted in this as in the first movie. I liked this one more than the first movie, but not by much, the best thing it had going for it was it focused more time on the mutants.\n\nSeriously though, Amell was fucking terrible as Casey.", "Transformers should take a note. This is a dumb summer action movie done right. \n\nThere were moments where I thought to myself, \"I shouldn't be enjoying this, but what the hell I'm having fun.\" I do agree that in the last 20 or so minutes, right when Shredder got frozen, the movie does start to lose it's charm a bit. It just became a whole mish mash of CGI action scenes. Often I just kept thinking, \"Wait, what exactly is their plan again?\"\n\nOverall, where I thought the first TMNT movie was around a 3 or 4 out of 10, Out of the Shadows is a solid 7/10. It's not a perfect movie, but it's successes heavily outweigh it's failures.", "This movie was pure fan service, and I love it for that.\n\nJust wish Casey had said googala, at least April said Cowabunga which still wasn't great but at least it was there.", "[deleted]", "Gary Anthony Williams and Sheamus must have had a different script because when they're on screen as Bebop & Rocksteady the movie peaks up and becomes extremely entertaining. I found myself wanting to see more of them and less of practically everyone else.\n\nStephen Amell however was awful in this, if it wasn't for the fact I know he plays Green Arrow I would have genuinely assumed he was just someone on the set who they found out played Hockey. it's weird when Tyler Perry is hamming it up in a film and it's somehow less annoying. \n\nThe plot is all over the place it's too many things in the air and none of them land with any grace. Shredder just stands there and grumbles and Krang shows up and goes \"Hey, we should work together.\" and Shredder just nods along to this weird Alien who just introduced himself. \n\nThough the thing that I noticed was besides the Turtles brotherly bond and Bebop & Rocksteady's friendship none of the characters felt like they connected to each other. Casey Jones just hangs around half arsing it. If Karai is meant to be Shredder's daughter in this then I couldn't tell from their performances for example.\n\nAll in all it's better than the first one, more enjoyable than Transformers but still just not quite there yet.", "If you liked the 80s cartoon you'll like this.

If you can accept that this is a kids movie based of a kids franchise and thus will have some problems with character development and pacing, your fine have a good time. They took the feel of the elevator scene and the semi truck fight from the first movie and drew it out to 90 mins. This is a TMNT movie where the Turtles take up 90% of the screen time *cough*2014movie*cough*. It really felt like a live action version of an episode. Really starts to slow when there's scenes with only the humans and especially Will Arnett's solo scene in the tower.\n\nThe intro was dope and the song at the credits is pretty neat too! Not the best movie but certainly not cancer as some reviews would have you to believe.", "This is the first movie in a long time where the trailer made me really want to see it.\n\nDo I need to watch the first one to get what's going on?", "Fan service is nice and all, but it doesn't excuse clunky exposition, weak storytelling, and rushed character development.", "I honestly thought this was the best TMNT movie ever.

Fun from start to finish.", "Overall, I thought the movie was alright, probably much better if you are a kid. There were a few things I didn't like though. The scene at the Knicks game had poor spatial awareness. Vern is standing courtside facing the crowd and the turtles shoot a spitball from above center court. Vern gets hit in the face (from the front), which is impossible. \n\nAlso, Donatello thinks if he reverses the function of the purple ooze it would make them humans.

He works hard on all his projects and he gives a lot of his friends work (like 85% of Happy Madison is people who he went to High School/College with and people he's befriended in show business), he's very charitable and he does a lot of work with sick children. He also can fucking act despite the shit he's been in. Punch Drunk Love is one of my favorite movies\n\nLike I said, he just sounds like a nice dude doing what a lot of us dream of. Who wouldn't love making movies with all your friends around you and making truck loads of money doing it? It seems at this point in his career he just likes making films that he can enjoy watching with his daughters and I feel bad for the guy even though I don't enjoy his movies.

This movie was really a mind fuck. Like just when you think you had it, you'd lose it.

Also the 2 queens represent superficiality how despite the white queen was immoral we still sympathized  with her more than the victim.

BUT HOW?! Time has STOPPED, so how are sparks moving? No matter can move at all! Ridiculous.\n\nThe Sea of Time scenes were great and looked visually amazing. DO NOT WATCH IN 3D! The 3D is a complete WASTE HERE! It's only good in maybe two scenes. That's it. It only gives a little bit of depth and nothing more.\n\nThe 2nd act was a complete cluster fuck. The constant time-jumping was ridiculous and I felt the logic was very flawed. We were following Alice as she jumped from scene to scene, so it was jarring to see each scene continue to play out in the movie even though she had already jumped away and headed into a different time. What I am referring to mainly is the whole 'tart' situation. \n\nAnne Hathway is ridiculous in this movie. Imagine her role in the first movie. Now, take that, make it overly goofy, take away all her goodness and sympathy, make her a real twit and then plop her into this movie. She served no purpose here other than to be a hazard in the past sequences.\n\nAll the animals and her basically blended into one character. There was really no need for them all and they felt VERY forced. Why do we need the dog giving Alice some old monologue if the White Queen can be doing it? Really stupid.\n\nOverall, I thought it was okay. I think we all need to stop taking this movie down to Hell and just accept it for what it is. It is a complete mess, but a fun mess! \n\nKeep Linda Woolverton away from any upcoming Disney movies!

Great - except Alice becomes an unintentional villain by not only ignoring Time himself, but by destroying the fucking universe by the end of the narrative. \n\nAll the performances were distractingly bad, Helena Bonham Carter steals the show by being loud, irritating and a symbol of the movie's failed script, as her finished conflict with the White Queen for some reason comes back to fruition after she wants her to admit to eating a tart. The Red Queen being so evil, violent and genocidal was because of a tart. I thought BvS' \"Martha\" scene was awful...\n\nThe visual effects and art direction are treated like an afterthought, as it becomes so apparent that the cast are looking at nothing at times that it breaks immersion, meanwhile, most of the decent visual effects all look the same and there aren't any impressive setpieces that come to mind when I think about the movie.\n\nI hated Batman v Superman, because its plots were garbage and added up to rubbish - at least that movie had a plot that you could keep track of.

It wasn't that bad...  overall, I actually enjoyed the movie.\n\nBut about Apocalypse... I think the writing really failed most of the movie. The entire movie is about how events specifically affect the X-men. An entire city is destroyed, that's millions of deaths... we see parts of Sydney destroyed, parts of New York, we see ports destroyed... the amount of death being shown, but not actually shown, is so high... yet the lens is only ever pointed at the X-men and how they are affected by what is happening. There's no pause for mourning the death of others, there's just no Humanity on display at all. The camera never shows us anything to actually care for. Instead we see strips of metal being ripped from the ground before cutting back to the team trying to overcome the 5 mutants they are up against.\n\nNow apply this same thing to En Sabah Nur... they spent so much of the movie talking about the history of him, the first of their kind. I actually thought they did an elegant job cutting a lot of his story to keep it understandable for the movie audience. He is the Father of all mutants, he only knows a way of life where he and his people are worshiped. It's not complex, but it's easy to digest and you can understand his immediate hatred towards seeing his children being treated as the scum of the earth. \n\nSo they build up this character who, lets be real, is kind of stupidly overpowered, but then they don't do anything with it. Instead he is nothing but a plot device to push the X-men forward. It's an X-men movie, so it's somewhat understandable that they are the plot that needs to be pushed, but in a 145 minute movie, to spend 90 minutes jumping from scene to scene of his recruitment, where his powers are talked about but nothing is really happening... it just felt like such a waste of time. \n\nThis movie spends so much time explaining how much of a God-incarnate he is, that I actually feel this would have been better as a 2 part movie. Keep most of this movie as the first movie, just have the third act be his destruction of the world, have the camera actually show the audience the destruction of life, the sadness and panic and despair. And end the first movie with the audience sitting there actually questioning how the X-men are going to protect the remaining civilization.\n\nThe MCU is slowly building Thanos. People who only know him from the movies may not understand what sort of force he is going to be, but they certainly know of his existence (unless they aren't paying attention). Apocalypse could have and should have been handled in a similar way. He's strong enough of a villain both character wise and strength wise that he could have carried a movie that focused on his destruction and then another movie that focused on ending him.\n\nInstead we got a movie where the protagonists take a plane from Canada to Egypt and stop his grand plan in the course of a day.\n\nTL;DR: they could have made Apocalypse similar to Thanos in MCU but instead made him Malekith from Thor: TDW.\n\nAlso, they couldn't fucking CGI him to at least be taller than Storm? Fine, you don't want to make him 8 feet tall as his base height, can you at least make it so he's not the shortest between he and the 4 Horsemen?

I loved Psylocke's purple weapons, the few times we get to see Storm use her power, Nightcrawler, Angel's wings (both feathered and metal), Cyclops and Havok's red beams, and Quicksilver literally running all over the exploding mansion. I also loved that elaborate opening with Apocalypse getting buried in the pyramid. Felt like a short film in its own right and I wish we saw more of his Horsemen using their powers. This definitely looked like a comic book film in the best way possible.\n\n- Most of the cast are great. Fassbender, McAvoy, and newcomers Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, and Nightcrawler are fun to watch. I'm looking forward to the sequel where the younger versions of this cast are given more to do. Evan Peters is always a hoot as Quicksilver. Also nice to see Havok return with a much bigger role, even though his sole purpose in the film was to get killed.\n\n- Cinematography was nice. It wasn't afraid to use lots of color, adding to its comic book look. It also had a lot of really great hero shots. \n\n- Wolverine was fun.\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Apocalypse was lame and uninteresting. Felt like a villain of the week of some fantasy TV series. He wants to clean the world and be worshipped again. Ok then.\n\n- Movie was all over the place. It was doing so much and ended up accomplishing almost nothing in the end. It was so busy introducing so many characters that it forgot to develop any of them. It also doesn't help that these characters were spread out in like 20 different countries so the movie had to find a way to put them all together. The movie clearly forgot to streamline the script because it was all just really clumsily written and haphazardly edited.\n\n- It had no momentum. The paper thin plot doesn't even kick in until the third act. Everything before that was either set-up or a distracting side plot (our main mutants get captured by Stryker and then they escape. Also they meet Wolverine along the way. The next movie's villain is set-up. Ok then.)\n\n- Jennifer Lawrence looked like she wanted to be far, far away from the set. She looked bored throughout the movie, and she really sticks out like a sore thumb because the rest of the cast were really enthusiastic or at least were trying their best when the cameras were rolling. It was especially jarring when she was in a scene with Quicksilver, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Nightcrawler. Everyone was totally in character and had their game on. Meanwhile Mystique looked like she was reading her lines from cue cards.\n\n- The last shot of X-Men: Days of Future Past is now nonsensical, and unless I'm mistaken, the filmmakers have completely ignored that the last time we saw Mystique, she was in the form of Stryker retreiving Wolverine from a river in Washington, D.C. Someone please point out an interview where they explain what that was all about, because this sequel sure as hell didn't explain it at all.\n\n- This is my biggest problem with the movie: Magneto felt like the most shoehorned character in the movie. I'm 100% serious. The movie had to go out of its way to introduce his wife and daughter, only to kill them both the next time we see them. It was almost comical the amount of tragedy that Magneto had to endure in this franchise. It really felt like overkill (no pun intended) just to give Magneto yet another reason to raise hell and get damaged even further. His character arc feels utterly ludicrous at this point and it's obvious that they no longer have any idea what to do with him. This really rubbed me the wrong way because of just how excessive and unnecessary it all was. The dude had to watch his mother, wife, and nine year-old daughter get killed right before his eyes *all in one lifetime*. Just... holy shit. It truly frustrates me because it feels obscene at this point. \n\n- It would've been far, far better if Magneto just helps out Charles and Raven from the get-go. He's found peace and probably spends his free time helping out a mutant here and there when he's not too busy taking care of his family. He goes out of hiding once he finds out his friends were in trouble because the dude has had like ten years to chill out and is raising a family of his own. He helps stop Apocalypse and saves Charles from this Egyptian maniac. Once they succeed, Magneto goes back to his family and bids a friendly goodbye to Charles after fixing his mansion. That, to me, is so much better than heaping *even more tragedy* in Magneto's life just so we can see him go full out villain before changing his mind again.\n\nOverall it's a fun movie, but it's bogged down with many problems. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it sure isn't a great one either.\n\n", "A lot of people have been talking about how the 4 horsemen were too weak, but the 4 horsemen we saw in the ancient egypt scene were badass. The first dissolved the flesh right off people, the other exploded/melted them, another was like some prehistoric super Beast that lifted a huge chunk of a pyramid, and the last had some super powerful shield that protected apocalypse from an entire pyramid falling on him. That entire scene had me on the edge of my seat.\n\nI think his 4 horsemen are just four followers that he replaces as necessary, until he finally ends up with 4 unbeatable ones. Psylocke would probably have ended up being replaced and, unless he wanted Angel to be his \"herald\" or something, Angel would have been gone too.\n\nOn a side note, I loved nightcrawler's outfits throughout the whole movie.", "That quicksilver scene was amazing and worth seeing the movie alone.Oh yeah rest of the movie was good too but not days of future past good.

I don't know, he didn't feel threatening or menacing enough, I can't help but feel that if they made him the behemoth that he is in most iterations (and if they had've played with his change of scale a bit more rather than just in Xavier's mind/school) then he would have been terrifying. Oscar Isaac was misused in this, they literally could have chosen any posh-sounding person to pull off what they did with the character.\n\nI was worried going into this that Mystique would steal the show, and while she was heavily involved, it made sense in this universe, and she wasn't the main character as much as the trailers made it seem. Mutants allover the world idolising her for saving the president is a cool thought, definitely a different take to what happened in the last standing timeline.\n\nI wish Angel didn't fucking die. He was by far the coolest character interpretation in the film, badass fighter, not just some dude with wings. Also, wtf, Psylocke has zero explanation at all, does like one cool thing ever and then skulks away at the end as if to suggest she'll be relevant in the future. Dumb. I'm not gonna complain about Storm as much as other's, she had some character development at least.\n\nDidn't hate Wovlerine's scene, wish he said something/anything tho.

I love Singer using lines from previous movies (now old timelines). \n\nBut somehow the entire movie just felt a little lacking. I didn't care as much as I should have about Havoc dying. I didn't feel the weight of the destruction, or the point of it really. I didn't feel any of the horseman's motivation besides Magneto. The Quicksilver/father thing is UTTERLY forced, and to the end I never really believed it. They completely blew the Pheonix reveal. It should not have been in this movie (the next one sure, but not here). Jean should have simply helped Charles win the battle of the minds, which would have been an awesome moment in and of itself, and would have been a completely adequate display of her power.\n\nTL:DR I loved it in parts but not the whole.

Kill her off, get everyone riled up and make her death the catalyst for taking down Apocalypse.\n\n* I think Apocalypse should've been a bit more imposing.  They played with his size in the mind battle which was a nice nod to his ability to grow in the comics, but I think he should've stood a head taller than the rest of the cast in his normal form.\n\n* More Psylocke please.  Very comic accurate costume and power set. Unfortunately Horsemen that aren't Magneto don't get much to do though and she (along with Angel and Storm to a degree) is just kind of there.\n\n* Essex Corp was a nice reveal.  Will we get X23 in Wolverine 3?\n\n* I liked the new cast, Sophie Turner especially.  I heard her accent was spotty and it took people out of the movie but I didn't notice at all tbh. Her phoenix blast was great.  I like that they just made it a part of her power set and not a dark split persona or a cosmic entity.  I don't think the Phoenix Force would fit into the world they've created.\n\n* Why are Scott's blasts always portrayed as generating heat or being like laser beams? In the source material it's just a concussive blast, like getting hit by a giant red freight train. For some reason on film they have to have it set trees on fire or melt metal. I don't really get why this change is made...it's minor sure but large enough that it bothers me (and others?)\n\nOverall, 6ish/10.

Quicksilver's scenes were fucking great; albeit his relationship with Magneto is another unresolved build-up for a future movie.

Their deaths were clearly telegraphed from the beginning and the scenes with Magneto and the kid were just sickeningly schmaltzy. Instead, they should have connected him straight away to the wayward mutants that end up as the Horsemen.

Xavier is suspicious from the start, so a good part of the second act is then taken up with the main characters learning the truth about him and his desire to purge the planet of all but his mutant followers.\n\nThis gives you a good reason to bring Stryker and the Alkali Base scenes in (if you can get past the clear change from the end of Days of Future Past where it's Mystique that recovers Wolverine) as he would be clearly distrustful of Apocalypse.

DOFP is one of my favorite superhero movies, and I even like The Last Stand. So despite the mediocre reviews, I was expecting to still enjoy it. \n\nA big issue was a lack of stand-out scenes. The ones I liked were:\n\nThe opening scene in Egypt. I liked the weird mutants, and I especially liked when one of them Mortal Kombated a guy and crumpled him into a ball in mid-air.\n\nThe fight between Nightcrawler and Angel at the beginning was cool and had good music. Also Angel getting his metal wings was pretty rad and had some gruesome effects. This movie overall seemed to go gorier.\n\nThe death of Magneto's family was pretty moving. \n\nThe highlight was obviously the Quicksilver scene, but then that was undermined by Havoc's poorly handled death. Quicksilver as a character is another highlight. He had a handful of really funny lines. But it was annoying that he didn't tell Magneto the truth. That could've supported Magneto's weak motivations.\n\nApocalypse was kind of cool in parts but overall wasn't that interesting. His best part was when he lifted all the nukes into the air. That was genuinely affecting and creepy. I didn't know what was going on.\n\nThe part at Stryker's place felt really unnecessary, and even the Wolverine appearance was disappointing. Without any lines, he was basically a special effect. He also looked goofy. Related: Normally the continuity problems of these movies don't bother me, but the fact that they didn't follow up Mystique's disguising herself as Stryker at the end of DOFP is pretty lame. Now that's just a cheap twist they used to make the end of that movie more interesting.\n\nThe new X-Men were decent; Nightcrawler was the most interesting.\nMoira was wasted, and the restoration of her memory at the end felt unearned. Beast surprisingly had a decent amount to do and was cool.\nThe villain team was all boring. \n\n", "Does nobody care that magneto killed hundreds of thousands of people? ", "Honestly i'm still just baffled at why they bothered to put Jubilee into the movie when you don't even see her powers :/", "[deleted]", "Was anyone bothered by the lack of citizens during the destruction of Egypt? YES, they all died obviously, but A. they BARELY showed them when the destruction happened and B. not even one person survived it.\n\nIt felt more like Apocalypse was destroying an abandoned city IMO. But that's just one of my few flaws. I really liked the movie.", "My new metric for judging superhero movies is \"How many helicopters were pulled down by the hands of the hero(es)?\" If the number is less than 1, it cannot qualify for my favorite superhero movie.", "i find it annoying that this is scoring and averaging lower than The Last Stand.  i mean yeah, it's one of the weaker X-Men films but it's way better than The Last Stand and the Wolverine films.\n\ni found more problems with this movie than the recent Civil War but i honestly found X-Men: Apocalypse to be more entertaining to watch.  also, the audience i was with seemed to enjoy it even more.", "Just got back from seeing it with my brother. Holy fuck, I think that was the worst movie I have seen in the cinema in ages. Let me start by listing what was good. \n\nBear in mind I went into this as an average movie goer and am not a fan of the comics at all. My knowledge of the characters is rudimentary at best.\n\n- Quicksilvers scene where he saves the school, even if it was basically a rehash of Days of Future Past. \n\n- When Quicksilver beats up Apocalypse. \n\n- When Charles is all like \"This is my house!\" Shame he was put down again so quickly. \n\n- The end bit when all the x-men do a cute little \"flame on!\" type thing. \n\n- Storm had an accent.\n\n- James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender awesome as ever. \n\nNow that is out of the way, in as close to chronological order as I can get. \n\n- How the hell were they able to make a fucking self-destruct device built into the pyramid... **with no one noticing**. Like, that would require actual planning at the design phase of the foundations. The blocks even had arrows on them! \n\n- Apparently a bathroom stall door is stronger than concrete and that is all you need to stop a blast from Cyclops. Because it sure would be horrible if he had to actually had to deal with the guilt of accidentally killing someone, who despite being a dick did not deserve to die and have an actual character arc! \n\n- Speak German and Polish or don't. Pick one. \n\n- Sophie Turner was so damn dull and lifeless. \n\n- Not once has the light shined onto the golden pyramid before? \n\n- OK, so Apocalypse can steal the powers of others using the glowy pyramid. But what the fuck is it! Where did it come from! Did he build it? Did he start off with a power then gain more? Thanks for telling me jack shit, movie.\n\n- Oh look, Mystique wants to be normal again. And by the end of the movie she is happy being blue. Again. \n\n- Oh look Magneto has gone from being a good guy to a bad guy and back to a good guy with hope instilled in him. Again. \n\n- Oh look. Beast wants to be normal again. And now he is back to being how he really is. Again.\n\n- Basically everyone's character just keeps on getting reset and then going through the same character arcs.\n\n- I'm Apocalypse, and I need a bunch of mutants to be my on my team. I'll just pick the first two I happen to meet, plus one that the really sexy one saw in a cage match once because why not? \n\n- I'll get rid of the nukes in the world by shooting them straight up! Whats that? They will come back down again because ICBMs are sub-orbital and also going straight up doesn't get you close to an orbit, you have to actually go mostly sideways. Meh.\n\n- What was the point of the woman! Apart from being **completely** responsible for Apocalypse returning she did nothing. Wasn't even needed to fly the jet, Beast could do that. Even her line to remind us all she was there just pointed out how utterly pointless she was. \n\n- \"You have to keep Cerebro a secret.\" Why even bring her in then! Tell her to wait in the office. \n\n- JUST SAY YOU ARE HIS SON!\n\n- \"I'm so fast, yet I'm always late.\" Ugh. \n\n- That is not how arrows work. What an annoying way to kill off two characters.\n\n- Sure was nice of Apocalypse to take time out of his busy schedule to make everyone costumes! Including a sexy one for the sexy one. \n\n- Why does Magneto keep losing his helmet and getting it back every film. Just start off with it! \n\n- Who the hell was that Chinese girl and why did everyone run off without her. Could have saved some money by not casting her. \n\n- You won't win, because you don't have friends! Double ugh. \n\n- Storm had no character. Why did she switch sides? Because she saw everyone else was. \n\n- Angels death was so lame.\n\n- The Apocalypse was boring. \n\n- When will Mystique finally join the bad guys? She did at the end of First Class but now she gives rousing speeches to the goodies. Oh yeah, because Jennifer Lawrence is the most marketable actor on the cast, which is also why she is hardly ever blue. She was almost the main character. The old trilogy wasn't great, but Mystique was so much more interesting in those ones.\n\n- Worst. Stan Lee. Cameo. Ever.\n\n- Oh no Charles is dead! No he isn't, we all know he isn't. You are just wasting my time now. \n\n- \"What did I miss!\" Oh nightcrawler, you silly goose! \n\n- So Mystique told Storm, someone she barely knows that Magneto is Quicksilvers father? Why? Oh so they could have that really awkward dialogue. Instead of telling someone important.\n\nI can go on all day. I'll just sum up by saying that I was so bored, I seriously thought about walking out. \n\n", "Jennifer Lawrence was terrible yet again.", "[deleted]", "I feel like I'm one of the only ones that really enjoyed the movie. It's not nearly as good as Days of Future Past, but I still left the theater impressed. A lot of that has to do with the mixed reviews that came out, so I went in expecting things to be pretty bad. Most of the negative things people have to say about the movie are legit, but I thought that the ending was really well done and some of the emotional moments between characters were pretty satisfying, so that outweighed the weaknesses for me. Also, with 16+ characters you can't really expect Oscar worthy plot or development for all of the characters. I mean hell, even the Avengers has trouble with development using a smaller cast. For what it is, I enjoyed the movie.\n\n- Apocalypse is pretty one dimensional and there's no real reason he chooses the 4 mutants he does to be his horsemen, let alone the fact that he's choosing just 4 of them. Like, is he trying to be all cute and shit? Why not have 400 horsemen?\n\n- There was a shit ton of introducing in this movie, which slows down the pace in the beginning, but once that got out of the way it felt solid.\n\n- There are a lot of characters, so the villains ended up getting shafted, but the story did a good job with the heroes. I appreciate that they set up the beginnings of Scott, Jean, and others and didn't try to shoehorn complete story arcs for everyone.\n\n- That Quicksilver scene was AMAZING. Sweet Dreams was a great choice of song.\n\n- Mystique is still too front and center, but I thought they did a much better job of having her be a supporting character for most of the movie than DoFP did. Her story was relevant and Jennifer Lawrence's acting was also a lot better than the first two X-Mens.\n\n- Not enough Jubilee! Not enough Psylocke! It kind of sucks that Psylocke is a super bad ass mutant but got such a small part. Again, the product of having so many damn characters in your story.\n\n- We've seen what Jean can do but I was actually pretty surprised they decided to go Phoenix with her so soon. I really loved that moment in the end and thought it was really well done. I feel like it made a lot of the ending come together.\n\n- I also loved that they allowed Quicksilver to have an actual serious, somewhat emotional moment and hold off on the father/son thing with Magneto. Professor X restoring Moira's memories was also really satisfying.\n\n- There's like, a massive shit ton of damage and death by the end of the movie and I kind of love that. It's something that the next movie will have to deal with and of course if it's something they just gloss over that'll be pretty fucking terrible, but I don't quite see that happening as it would be too much of a misstep. \n\nThe movie isn't perfect by any means but I enjoyed it a lot more than I was expecting to.", "The pacing and dialogue in this movie was disappointing at at times flat out weird. Havoc's death was immediately followed by a slapstick comedy moment by Quicksilver, who just magically showed up at exactly the right time to save *everyone*. The drama of all the nukes going up in the air was broken by the really poorly-timed Stan Lee cameo. Half of the lines were cliche or wooden (\"It should have been me,\" \"forget everything you think you know.\")\n\nCharacter motivations were hard to discern. Storm joined Apocalypse on his quest to end the world and then fought against him but her reasoning is murky at best (I guess she was a thief so she was ok with joining the bad guys, but she also looked up to Mystique so she changed her mind?) Quicksilver went to Egypt to introduce himself to his dad and ended up not doing so for no apparent reason. Magneto went from being a caring father to going on a murderous rampage to being okay with destroying the whole world to finally turning on Apocalypse after hearing a few lines about family, and then all is forgiven. Apocalypse was powerful enough to take on everyone at once - save for Phoenix - yet only ever resorted to nonlethal means of fighting just to keep all the good guys alive. The characters were just not believable or relatable and too obviously made to follow the whims and needs of the plot.\n\nThe acting was also pretty bad. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender killed it, as usual, but Jennifer Lawrence was extremely boring and looked as though she didn't want to be there. Sophie Turner couldn't pick an accent and was just uninteresting the whole time. (Though I have to admit that in general I think Lawrence and Turner are both overrated, monotone actresses). Tye Sheridan's facial expressions were ridiculous and even Hugh Jackman was disappointing. I love him as Wolverine but his attempts to seem feral just looked goofy.", "Was it just me or did the entirety of the movie happen in the last 30 minutes? It felt as if it was building up for this massive event which turned into a 15 minute CGI bonanza.\n\nAnyway, some pointers:\n\n- Apocalypse is one of the greatest villains in Marvel history yet they turned him into the most generic \"fuck-the-world\" bad guy that gets mind-killed by Jean Grey. Hell, they could have split his appearance over 2-3 solid films but he's gone now so who cares.\n\n- I'm sorry but Sophie Turner is an awful Jean Grey. \n\n- Jubilee doesn't do shit. Boo.\n\n- The Quicksilver rescue scene was great but sort of dragged on for no reason.\n\n- I would've like to have seen more Psylocke outside of the 3 punches she threw at Beast at the end.\n\n- Archangel was cool with his apocalypse-d wings.\n\n- Wolverine cameo was great and the Mr Sinister hype is real.\n\n- Apart from the inherent cheesiness of Mystique's character over the years, she was actually pretty good and wasn't front-and-center to everything this time.\n\nAnyway, it was a decent film but good lord they could have done better. 6.5/10.\n\nEdit: Got my angels mixed up. As you do.", "The reviews lowered my expectations a ton, so I went in not as hyped. But boy, did I ever have some fun! Solid film!", "'Serviceable' is the word I'd use to describe X-Men Apocalypse. It's entertaining in parts and nowhere near being the disaster that Rotten Tomatoes reviews painted it to be. One more reason never to put much stock in a mere review aggregation website.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Quicksilver's highlight scene. With 'Sweet Dreams' by Eurythmics playing in the background. Phenomenal stuff.\n\n* Fassbender as Magneto. His entire subplot was very well done. Some terrific acting from him. Movie is worth watching just for him alone.\n\n* This movie had elements of body horror, very reminiscent of David Cronenberg's films. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n* That special 'cameo' scene. It was ripped right out of the comic-books. This is the brutality expected. And I loved it!\n\n* Cyclops & Nightcrawler were surprisingly amazing in the movie. For how little we got them. Which brings me to....\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Overall writing. I wanted more of Cyclops and Nightcrawler. And the younger students. Sadly they were pushed back into secondary roles.\n\n* Archangel & Psylocke - both had a TOTAL of 15 lines in the entire movie. Very little characterization, very good in fight sequences but woefully wasted.\n\n* Apocalypse. Now Oscar Issac played him well (for what material was provided to him), it's not the acting that bothered me. It's his characterization which made me, I don't know, angry. Such an interesting figure, and they gave him such generic motivation.\n\n* Jen Law as Mystique. Oh man, she's such a miscast. And the most infuriating part - she just phones it in, all through-out the movie. Where the rest of actors are atleast trying. You pause any scene she's in and watch her face, she doesn't want to be there. I kid you NOT!\n\nOverall: \n\nNot as good as Future Past, First Class, X2 or Deadpool. But leagues better than The Last Stand, first X-Men and both Wolverine movies.", "This is pretty much Cyclops and Jean's movie but I don't feel like the two of them --or any of the new characters introduced for that matter-- have much of a personality. And we don't get much building of the Charles and Eric characters that have been (to me) the best part of this series so far. In fact most of the characters in this movie stand around and look/talk dramatically for most of their screen time, including Apocalypse. Most of the other dialogue feels like fan service either hinting at or directly referencing things about the X-Men universe.\n\nOverall I feel like this movie has very little rewatchability (save for Quicksilver scene, of course). I don't know where they're going with this series but I hope they get back to the lower stakes, personal plot developments of DoFP. I can't rank this movie in the top 3, maybe even 5, of all X-Men movies so far.\n\nAlso, Charles and Eric should've been playing chess during their final discussion about Magneto leaving the school!!", "**The cartoon was better.**", "Charles should of just said Martha to Apocalypse", "\"At least we can all agree the third one's always the worst.\" -Jean \n\nCommentary on the film? =P", "\"As your God I will now transfer myself into a new body.\"\n\n\"Sir, the slaves secretly constructed an elaborate stone block slide system to collapse the pyramid.

It was built for fans. It is reminiscent of the great change in the Xmen comics when the original team is thought dead and Xavier gathers the likes of Storm and Wolverine etc. It is a pivotal moment in the comics and it is, now, a pivotal moment in the movie universe.\nLove how they handled Scott, he was a bit of a prick but that's him. Enjoyed the fan worship of Raven. Really loved Magneto's storyline....... only one arrow though? Great to see Magneto's full power realized, same with Charles. Interesting that Quicksilver never said anything to Erik and also interesting that he the writers/producers/director brought is back into the storyline.\n\n\nI have only a couple of nit picks about it - Weapon X should have been wearing the original design red square goggle head piece and then have been revealed as Logan in the scene with Jean by the door. \nIn the final battle. I fear Hugh Jackman is a \"face\" and the movie is full of them. Apocalypse should have physically grown in stature as he grew in the battle with Charles. Apocalypse' true power was still untapped and having them gang together to bring him down would have had more meaning. Picture the towering En Sabah Nur and then the 'Phoenix' as a small flame in comparison, then growing as Apocalypse shrank down to size.\nIt was a smart way to have Charles lose his hair, nice to see Caliban, Angel post change was only alright looking, not half as menacing as his original, natural look TBH. Delighted to see Storm in her early years, although the white hair change was a bit groan worthy. Nightcrawler looked just how I would imagine him, thin and with a head of thick hair.\n\nBut that scene with Quicksilver and the mansion was class and with what happened to Havok -excellent story telling.\n\nOverall, I thought that was a great flick, pivotal and important, A few what if's, a few \"shoulda done it this way\"s but I'll be seeing it again and I look forward to the next Xmen movie and hope for more marvel intervention and more of the civil rights aspect of their stories. I can see why critics didn't like it but I really did love it.\n\nEDIT: a few words and I an delighted they highlighted the nuclear arms race.

Apocalypse is a bad guy to be a bad guy, you never find out why he made it his life work to steal other mutants powers and become immortal other than the obvious \"he just wanted to do it\".  Normally I would give that a pass but the Horsemen shit doesn't make ANY sense.  Storm watches a guy turn people into ash and stick a guy in a wall, and she brings the guy back to her home even though he can't even speak her language.  Then, she joins forces with him after he declares he wants to take over the world, even though she just told him she wants to be a hero just like Mystique.  The same thing happens with both Psylocke and Angel, they kind of just join because why not?\n\n\nAt least Magneto has a reason for joining, but the scene where his family dies is so terrible the entire Magneto plot-line feels so ham-fisted its insulting.  You're telling me a guy with a handmade, fully-wooden bow and arrow, being attacked by birds, is gonna his bow and arrow pulled back with enough force that he accidentally lets go of the arrow which just happens to fly through the air, hitting Magneto's daughter, going THROUGH his daughter, and then THROUGH his wife, killing both of them instantly?  I was holding back laughter in the theater at the absurdity.\n\n\nWhat's really strange about the Horsemen thing is that the movie specifically says that they aren't mind controlled.  My assumption was that Apocalypse powering up a mutant makes them want to follow him as a side benefit or something, but Xavier gets powered up and doesn't switch sides.  And its not because Xavier has a heart of gold and the other characters were already bad, because Storm was one of the horsemen and she switched over to being a good guy.  Also, if all of the Horsemen are just being influenced by Apocalypse, that completely negates Magneto's entire anger/redemption arc, because it means that he wasn't making his own decisions.\n\n\nIn the end of the movie, Storm and Magneto become \"good guys\", but the movie completely ignores how Magneto would have killed a SHIT ton of people by ripping up cities.  Its one thing for Superman to blow through buildings trying to stop Zod from killing everyone, its another thing for a guy to purposefully mass-murder and then apologize afterward.\n\n\nSometimes superhero movies have stupid plots, and that can be okay for the most part, but the writing for this movie makes the rest of it pretty irredeemable.  Some terrible and generic lines I remember are:\n\n\n\"Forget everything you know, or were ever taught!\" which really doesn't even make sense in the context of the scene.  How will forgetting everything you know make you a better fighter?\n\n\n\"Even though I'm super fast, I always end up being late.\" Really, the guy who can evacuate an entire mansion in the seconds its exploding is going to complain about being late?  And its not like we ever see him being late, so its kind of just a problem manufactured for drama.\n\n\nOkay, but even if the writing is bad the movie can still be entertaining just for the action, right?  Normally I would think so, but the action in this movie is really, REALLY sub-par.\n\n\nPsylocke was advertised heavily, but is really only in the movie significantly for maybe 10-15 minutes.  The only thing she does is fight Beast in a pretty forgettable fight, where she wraps a lazer-whip around his neck (which is powerful enough to cut a car in half) but still fails to kill him.\n\n\nArchangel shoots some feathers at the X-men and then spends the rest of his time fighting with Nightcrawler, which is at least a serviceable fight scene.  Storm has never been good in fight scenes since her powers aren't particularly punchy, so she pretty much just shot lightning at people.  Magneto didn't even fight anyone besides Apocalypse, so there wasn't anything from him either.\n\n\nApocalypse was so powerful there was no way for anyone to actually attack him except for Quicksilver, who can pretty much stop time.  The quicksilver attack looked good but it lasted like 10 seconds.  Quicksilver's scene in the mansion was fun, but it was exactly the same concept as the DoFP scene.  If the rest of the movie was good I would give it a pass, but its really not.\n\n\nThe last fight scene is just a bunch of people shooting shit at Apocalypse, who is standing there doing nothing, Xavier punching Apocalypse in a mental fight, and then Phoenix coming out and burning Apocalypse away and ending it basically on her own.  It really wasn't very compelling and kind of reminded me of the Doctor Doom fight from Fant4stic (definitely not as bad, but similar in concept and boredom).\n\n\nI won't say all of the movie is bad, I actually liked young Cyclops quite a bit and thought a lot of the young cast worked.  But the bad in this movie is so overwhelming its insane.", "I got the absolute shivers when phoenix made her appearance. ", "It was ok. Can't say much more than that, though it was definitely way better than Last Stand and Origins.\n\nI agree with the general consensus that Apocalypse himself was kinda weird. I wish they had played up the god complex more, because most of his best lines and imagery came from that (really liked the \"arrows from the Tower of Babel\" line). Other than that though he just wasn't any more menacing than other powerful mutants until the last battle or so. Moreover, Oscar Isaac was totally wasted. I didn't mind the voice but the character was basically a plot device other than the god stuff.\n\nMost of the other characters were fine. As I thought, the Mystique concerns were overblown since the universe was rewritten and she became a different kind of character, which totally made sense in the context of DOFP. They even wrote in a decent explanation for the JLaw form as a reversal of the \"mutant and proud\" stuff, concluding with her going blue at the end.\n\nMagneto and Charles were good as always. Really wish their dynamic had been used besides the end with the flashback to First Class, but they're strong characters on their own, and Fassbender and McAvoy were solid once again.\n\nThe other Horsemen were decent. Liked what little there was of Storm's development, Angel was sort of underused but a cool concept for his design and powers, Psylocke was just kind of there. Not sure what made her valuable enough for Horseman status, and out of everyone she was the only one whose powers didn't visibly improve, but whatever.\n\nKids were good. Could have used better Jean-Scott scenes than \"hey let's go to the mall\", especially since there was nothing between that and when he first met the others (plus they didn't even go). Still, their powers were cool, and it was great to see Nightcrawler again. Quicksilver once again the best of the (younger) bunch.\n\nI guess overall, the biggest problem this had was that the stakes just weren't there on a larger level. The world had already ended in DOFP, and the combination of time travel with hope for preventing singular events like Trask's assassination made it interesting. Not to say they couldn't have made another end of the world plot interesting, but if they don't have some sort of stakes besides the whole thing being remade it's just not gonna stand up. **6/10** for me.", "CGI was terrible, last fight too long and uninteresting along with apocalypse being pretty bland and generic, but McAvoy and Fassbender were fantastic and Quicksilver was tite again, I enjoyed myself enough but it's the worst of the last three by far", "God damn can Fassbender bring the feels ", "Just some thoughts:\n\n-- Micheal Fassbender is too good for this film. His Magneto is perfect. If they can convince Fassbender and McAvoy to return it will be a miracle. \n\n-- Apocalypse was terrible. AS someone pretending to be a prophet, his speeches were unconvincing and persuasive. If they had gotten someone with a cooler voice (ex. Idris Elba), I don't think I would have been as bothered by it. Issac's creepy old man whisper was too much. \n\n--  ALSO, WHAT THE FUCK WERE HIS POWERS!?!?! Until I get a solid answer, I'm sticking with \"pudding powers\", because it looked like he was trapping everyone in pudding due to the terrible CGI in parts.\n\n-- Everything I hate about Singer's films were placed front and center in this film and dialed to 11. The forced Weapon X bullshit, the need to take itself to seriously and then the spoon feed the audience humor, and most of all the joyless black leather jumpsuits. I couldn't help but laugh at how they tried to explain them in the story. \n\n--Any goodwill Days of Future Past made is now wiped away.

Even after the bad reviews came in, I figured that I could at least enjoy it for the huge action scenes, but the movie just did not deliver on anything.\n\nThe characters were barely fleshed out, and any development they had was superficial or rushed. The most frustrating thing about the movie was that they had 2 characters that they could have built the movie around in Cyclops and Jean Grey, and at times it felt like it was trying to, but instead, the movie split its time to showcase other characters that went nowhere. Aside from Magneto, the villains have even less time than the main characters, and I simply did not care about any of them. I was excited to see Isaac as Apocalypse, but his talent was completely wasted. \n\nMy last hope for the movie was that it would have exciting action scenes. I was disappointed with how the movie didn't have any extended fight scenes until the last 30 minutes of the movie. The highlight of the movie was, again, Quicksilver's speed scene that was somehow even better than DoFP's scene. The final battle that the movie built up to fell flat. However, I feel that Apocaylpse's end suited the character perfectly. A bland villain was killed in a bland way. \n\nOverall, it was a disappointing movie with some good moments sprinkled in. The best compliment I can give it is that at least it's not X3.", "I liked the movie very much!

It's not the Death Star.\n\n* Apocalypse's first three henchmen are really just the first three random mutants that he sees. Why didn't he decide on finding the strongest?\n\n* Why did Apocalypse need Cerebro if he could broadcast himself?\n\n* That Magneto's wife and daughter would die was just predictable. And the arrow just so happens to kill both at the same time. Come on!\n\n* Magneto, when enhanced can change the Earth's Magnetic fields but the other three horsemen even when enhanced are still really weak.

A girl named *Ororo Munroe* grew up in Egypt?  I really liked her, even if she was underutilized.  Praise be to the mohawk, though.\n\n* I haven't seen anyone criticize or praise 'Pocky's costume after seeing the movie.  Since they really focused on the \"he's the world's first mutant who has lived for tens of thousands of years,\" I think having ancient-looking armor makes sense.  In the context of the movie, I think that costume is better than the futuristic version everyone is familiar with.\n\n* It took me a long time to realize that by the opening scene, 'Pocky had already been alive for a long time.  The scene with Charles, Hank, and Moira where she explained he was tens of thousands of years old, I was thinking \"bullshit, the opening scene said 3000 BCE, that's 5000 years\"  Maybe a little opening credits montage \u00e1 la Wolverine where they show him through different time periods would have helped me understand that.  But wait, the post-credits scene from Days of Future Past clearly showed him in Egypt as a relatively normal-looking dude, right?\n\n* Fucking Morlocks.  Loved it.\n\n* Wolverine's cameo was appropriate.  It makes sense that Stryker would have him in captivity.  I'm a big fan of watching Stryker continually realize why trying to weaponize Wolverine is a bad idea.  His reveal with the Weapon X mask (but no diaper, wtf.) got a number of cheers in my theater.  We all knew who it was, but the cheers were specifically for the mask.\n\n* And then the Danger Room.  The only way they could have topped it was if they had the classic lineup there instead.  It wouldn't have worked in context of the movie, but getting rid of Mystique and Quicksilver and adding Iceman would have been enough.", "I liked and disliked the film,  it felt like it took a while to get going for me.\n\n* CGI:\n\nThe opening CGI looked worse than any recent film.  It didn't ruin the movie, but it was jarring to go on a weird roller coaster through time.  (And then another roller coaster in the scene where Moria finds Apocalypse.  Also the guy who got burned was awfully fake.  The last CGI thing, when we see Apocalypse decapitate those three dudes (which looked great) he plasters the last guy to the wall and it looked bad.\n\nAlso there was good CGI, the astral plane was cool, the scene were Magneto tears up his past was visually stunning and awesome, and the Quicksilver stuff was top quality.  Also on a much more personal level, BAMFING WAS GOOD!\n\n* Characters\n\nPoor Jubilee.  At least give her lines Bryan!  I think they wasted Angel and then wasted him.  Poor Warren.  Theif Storm was a blast from the past!  Psylocke was cool but sparse.  Nightcrawler was in the movie and actually had good lines and scenes!  I'm glad beast looks more beastlike, and acts it too.  \n\n* Story\n\nThe set up for the horsemen was weak except for Storm, then they kind of wasted her setup by not further elaborating on her decision to turncoat.  They could've at least held the camera on her reaction for a little longer as she watched her hero being choked out.  The setup for Apocalypse felt like a set up, and was weak IMO.  Why did he pick such disloyal horsemen?  I wish he had just mind controlled them or something.  To be fair, his motivations to be everyone made much more sense than a lot of villain plots.\n\nI really liked Magneto's story.  Something about it resonated with me and I really felt for him.  \n\nMystique's hero angle was not done as well as it could've been and was a bit lackluster.  I don't blame Jlaw for this; she did fine and actually looked better than she ever has as mystique.

I really liked what they did with Magneto, I felt for him, and I'm glad he's finally happy to be friends with Charles again. Just kinda sucks they show him leave, like he lost his life, he only has Charles and Raven where would he even go? Really sucks that QS didn't say he was his son either.

Some great action too.\n\nThere's a ton of little things that ruined it for me. I'd have ignored them in a stronger film, but there were so many they piled up. Why couldn't Scott just blow a hole in the helicopter to disrupt the electric field, allowing Jean and Kurt to use their powers? How did Jean's ability to make them psychically invisible work to hide them when we see shots of security camera screens being monitored and they are clearly visible there? Why did Magneto, despite speaking fluent Polish at work and even with his family switch to English to give his big angry speech to a bunch of *Polish* factory workers, none of whom can understand a damn word he's saying?

Schlock, all schlock.\n\nSo the kid in the very beginning just so happens to be staring at a picture of Misty the moment her car comes barreling through his home? C'mon. So Gosling accidentally crashes his car to just get back in enough time to stop the bad guy from killing his daughter? Yeah right. And, for that matter, why did Jon Boy hesitate at all in killing Amelia? He had her asleep and completely vulnerable, why throw the kid out the window and go for a gun? Why even talk to the kids at all when you're already in the house and you know you're target is in the next room? They set him up to be this badass assassin the previous scene only for him to be an idiot later on.\n\nAlso, I loved the scene towards the beginning where Gosling cuts his hand while trying to break in. Genius, and incredibly funny. But how come later on people are crashing through glass nonstop, him included, and there isn't an ounce of blood? He literally flies through multiple windows towards the end and walks it off like it's nothing.\n\nThere were far too many scenes of them stumbling mindlessly upon crucial plot points. Like, they'll be driving around and one of them will say \"Stop! What's that?\" And it's a billboard of porn producer Sid they're looking for, or it's the exact hotel that Amelia just so happened to be having a meeting in that night. Or Ryan Gosling will fly backwards off a balcony to stumble exactly upon Amelia and a dead body. Or they'll just so happen to find a note corresponding to a car show that very night just in time for them to stop it.

That being said, I'm clearly in the minority on that latter point.", "This movie is what would happen if Wes Andersen and Franz Kafka had a kid who directed a movie.", "I thought the first half in the hotel was absolutely amazing. It did lose a lot of steam after that but it was still wonderfully shot. \n\nReally dark humour...when they showed the corpse of the dog the audience was horrified. And that ending was just nail biting. \n\nWhen I walked out I didn't love it but the more I think about it the more I start to really enjoy it. Just the cinematography alone was gorgeous enough to warrant a watch.\n\nIf you're averse to animal cruelty I'll avoid watching this though.", "This is one of those movies where I loved the first half, but the second half just dragged on to the point I was waiting for the film to end.\n\nI loved the hotel, the intricacies of all the characters there, but the forest part was so repetitive and needlessly cruel I couldn't get into it.", "For better or for worse, this was far and away the most wholly original film I've seen in a long time, if ever.

Must be just getting released in the States or something.", "I absolutely loved this film. Maybe it's because I recently ended a very long term relationship that I thought the satirical take on societal pressures for love in this film were dead on. From the basic premise to the bizarre little touches like how a couple is formed of the most minute similarity (nose-bleeds, limps, German), it really drove home a lot of the absurdity of coupling while also revealing in the same tropes as a romantic film with a lot of weird slabbed on top. I like how the film took it's time to build it's rhythm so when you finally meet Weisz you really do like her and find the relationship beautiful in it's own bizarre twisted fashion. I think Lanthimos has made three films now that take basic societal pressures (raising a family, grieving, and now love) to their most illogical extremes.

It's so nice to see Colin Farrell putting his talents to good use. Despite the film having second act problems, I found it fascinating to watch and it picked its speed back up towards the end quite nicely. *The Lobster* might be one of the best (albeit bittersweet) meditations on love and relationships I've ever seen.  I've never seen a film so properly satirize the bizarre attitude society has towards single people. That said, I also liked that it wasn't one-sided. I particularly appreciated the way single people and \"matched\" people were depicted--who hasn't felt that way in one's social circle at one point or another?", "What a gorgeously fantastic movie.\n\nI saw it about three months ago, don't remember what country exactly, but in a very small screening room. Had about thirty people. Ten left at the first fifteen minutes, and a couple left at the dog scene.

Can't choose if I prefer the twisted hotel or the fucked up forest, but I love them both.

I feel so uncomfortable\" then they follow it up with David's fantastic comment about not being able to hear the heartless lady over the sounds of someone dying.\n\nProbably one of my favorite movies. I also noticed that the movie resonated in a comedic way with younger crowds. I saw it twice in theaters, once on a tuesday with a bunch of young adults presumably on dates (wonder how those turned out after this movie lol) and another on a sunday with a lot of older adults and some elderly people.

This is what happens when a non-conventional film draws mainstream attention.  It gets all the cliche comments from plebians.\n\nI didn't even find the movie all that weird.

Most of the stuff before that part really worked for me - the humour was quirky and I thought the themes the movie was trying to explore about society and interpersonal relationships were interesting.\n\nMost of the stuff that came *after* that part did not work for me at all. I understand that Lea Seydoux's band of rebels was meant to be an ironic \"they're not so different after all\" juxtaposition to the oppressive dogma of the hotel, but a lot of the things that happened were just too bizarre and absurdist.

I thought the plot and location in the first half were really original and new; turning into an animal if you can't find a mate, to me, was a satirical look at relationships and the pressure put on people to marry.

Some people praise how all the characters talk incredibly strangely, or how they move, but dear lord I just found myself struggling to care about a movie where each character talks like a 5 year old. They move the same way (the fight between John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw may be the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've ever seen).\n\nThe plot is nonexistent. The hotel was an interesting setting for the film, but it's dropped in favor of some generic woods. The old characters? Almost forgotten. Instead the audience is left to just guess what's going on. All that's given is that Colin Farrell is in love with Rachel Weisz, but that's tough to tell because of the emotionless acting.\n\nThe film's premise, while oddball, was promising. Of course, once Colin Farrell flees into the woods, it's mostly just an excuse to put weird animals into the background of each shot. The \"turn into an animal if you fail\" thing is only used for something like 3 scenes. Colin Farrell saying why he wants to be a lobster, that woman who became a pony, and aforementioned fight scene. The rest of the hotel bits are just an *incredibly* awkward romantic retreat.\n\nThe only scene with any emotional impact is the one where Ashley Jensen commits suicide. It was refreshing to see someone do SOMETHING, even if that was scream in pain and horror. Great scene. The only other part in the movie that could be considered emotional is the one where Angeliki Papoulia kills Colin Farrell's brother/dog. What could have been a gripping scene is ruined by two things. First, Colin choosing to be with a complete psychopath, something he already knew, and how she mimicked a dog's whimpering, which was honestly comical. The icing on the cake was the Scooby-Doo chase sequence afterward.\n\nAt least the cinematography was good. Pretty movie. Shame it had to be the frame around the blandest painting ever put to canvas.", "A friend and I could not stop laughing at the seemingly awkwardly-bad-on-purpose performances and inhuman conversations.

It places it's criticism of society's impositions towards love inside it's own awkward world and tells a story about true love between two unusual people.  Many characters talk in a monotone which makes me think of how poor most people's social skills are and how oppressive society can be.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the movie is quite excellent.  Most criticisms I've heard have come from a distaste for content although they're often disguised as technical criticisms.  The characters are complex and very human with layers of qualities and flaws.  Even criticised characters are likeable and even those who commit more abominable acts are not without meritable qualities.  The acting is excellent.  I am especially fond of Lea Seydoux's performance.  I honestly did not even recognize her.  The cinematography is aesthetically artistic.  I really can't find any fault with this movie.

", "Note that these are my opinions; therefore my analysis (especially about the themes) might be right or wrong.\n\nIt's amazing and one of my favourite films of the year so far. The humour was brilliant, the set design exquisite, the soundtrack soaring.\n\nIt's very 'British' if you know what I mean. British films are often more interested in class and High-Rise has this in spades; but the biggest joke of the film is that instead of plain old rich vs poor, it's very-rich vs slightly-rich. It also plays into British fears of Brutalist buildings - those 'concrete monstrosities'. As another comment stated, I am British so I 'got it', so I may be a little biased.\n\nIt's ambiguous. As in the book, some of the bigger questions go unanswered. Was the High-Rise purposefully designed to be faulty by Royal as an experiment in a 'crucible for change', or just a case of a building built 'for man's absence, not man'? Was there something in the building that triggered a psychological response (like the 'psychic event' described earlier) or was it that people were unable to live together?\n\nIt's a very dense film. I feel as though I need to watch it again to pick up on all the subtle details.\n\nIt's maddening. That is to say, it's the only film that made me feel mad when I watched it. I was left in my seat in the cinema (and when I was walking out) with a feeling of something like dread. I had not just partaken in the madness, I had *understood* it. Does that make me mad too?\n\nIt's got wonderful performances. I can't think of a single weak character or performance in the movie. Luke Evans was especially good as Wilder; the tape recorder scene was terrifying.\n\nIf it seems like I'm overpraising the film, it's because I'm struggling to come up with any major criticisms. It may have been slightly slow in parts, but it's all a part of the experience.\n\nBut yeah, I thought it was really, really good. It is about a ton of different things; take bored residents in a building that acts as a mother - what happens when the support starts to collapse? It's a warning about detachment - Laing is so obsessed with trying to keep out of the conflict and retreat inwards that by the end of the movie he is referring to himself in the third person. It's about the fragility of society.\n\nAt the moment, High-Rise and Eye in the Sky are my top two films of the year.", "Beginning drew me in but the rest fell flat, the overall cinematography was the only thing I can take away as being worth the experience, the other stuff, whatever messages about societal collapse or classism within the levels of the building wasnt telling them in a new or interesting way. It's easy to make that kind of theme work, but Wheatley managed to bore and confuse me at the same time. The acting was only slightly believable and the characters were hard to like or care for, because their actions made zero sense, and the incohesive nature of the scenes failed to help.\n\n A lot of people are saying you need to watch it more than once to 'get it', but theres nothing to really get, and one shouldnt have to suffer through a movie like that twice to get it, 4/10 personally would not recommend it.", "I think a lot of the criticisms of the film are unfair. Plenty of people call it's messages heavy-handed yet paradoxically can't seem to articulate what exactly those messages are. I think they're missing that class war is the backdrop of the story and not the story itself. The film is no more heavy-handed for mentioning/showing class a lot than Civil War was heavy-handed for all the times it mentioned/showed superheroes - the stuff goes with the territory the film is in. The film has a shitload of stuff to say about a lot of things, it's the kind of film where second and third watches are needed to fully get what it's saying beyond the obvious stuff about capitalism and patriarchy.\n\nI think another problem was that people were expecting a more straightforward plot with something like Laing going floor by floor Dredd style to save the day and fix things. That's not the kind of story High-Rise is trying to tell though and Laing is a false-lead: the film is the story of the building, not any one character within it. If anything the building is *the* central character, and is what drives the plot forward. Laing is our ticket into the building, after that the plot splits off into a more rhizomatic narrative as it follows the other inhabitants.\n\nAnother point where I think the complaint is mainly about the film not being the film people wanted it to be is the complaint about how there's not really much of a transition stage between normality and anarchy. That's completely correct, but so what? That's the film. It's not like 'transition stage' was something on the writer and director's to-do list that they never got round to, it's a deliberate choice and something central to the narrative. Criticising it is criticising the film for being the film. Instead of just dismissing it as bad for not kow-towing to your expectations of what the film should be like why not just embrace it, and maybe think about why it was done? That seems to me like way more interesting than just knee-jerking into \"wrong! Bad!\".\n\nI feel the same way about the criticism of the characters. It's a surrealist, allegorical film: the characters aren't supposed to be realistic and neither are their choices. You don't criticise the Allegory of The Cave for being unrealistic with dumb characters. The dialogue  deliberately has one foot out of reality, it has deadpan dark humour running throughout that you need to be perked up to catch and most of the lines serve multiple purposes. For people who want to see what Ben Wheatley is about I recommend Kill List, it's a more straightforward film that helps you pick up on a lot of what Wheatley is about. It has the same genre bending, the same decision to stray to narrative paths less trodden, and the same kind of British humour. It has the same style of dialogue although done in a way where it's easier to see the humour and easier to see the multiple meanings and connections to plot/theme seemingly irrelevant lines have.\n\n\n For a little about what the film is about I recommend [this](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/03/jg-ballards-high-rise-takes-dystopian-science-fiction-to-a-new-level) article. The film is well acted, well scripted, well scored, well shot, and well edited. It does what it sets out to do. It isn't a bad film, \"this isn't the kind of film I like\" is something its critics would be better saying than \"this film is just bad\".\n", "Here are my thoughts from a thread I made on the film.  \n  \nJust caught this last night. First off, let me say I'm a huge fan of Ben Wheatley and was really looking forward to this film. After seeing it however, my feelings are...mixed.  \n\nBefore I get in to the things I didn't like, let me start with the aspects of the film I really enjoyed. For one, it was phenomenally acted by everyone. Particular standouts for me were Sienna Miller, who I never really thought much of as an actress, really nailed (no pun intended) the role of the promiscuous, ladder-climbing socialite and gossip. Luke Evans too, he was just brutal and funny and really stole the show anytime he was on screen. Of course, Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Irons, Elizabeth Moss, James Purfoy and Peter Ferdinando were all excellent too.\n  \nThe film also had some absolutely amazing cinematography. The lighting, blocking, mise en scene, soundtrack (loved the orchestral versions of ABBA) and set design were all meticulously crafted and really did a fantastic job of transporting you into the time and place of the film. I was instantly engaged and fascinated by the world it created from the opening scene.\n  \nNow, the bad. Let me just say, I really, really wanted to like this film. I had been anticipating it's release for quite a while. Unfortunately, I found it to be a bit of a chore to finish. I respect and understand what the story was trying to accomplish but some things just didn't work for me. The dreamlike quality of the narrative and descent into societal collapse and madness, just felt...unjustified? I'm not entirely sure how to explain my thoughts here exactly (which is why I wanted to start a discussion here) but I just know that my gut reaction was that the film somehow managed to be both incredibly fascinating to watch visually while being a chore to sit through at the same time. Like running in sand on the beach, the view is incredible but it's also really exhausting and just not very fun.\n  \n  \nThe film felt like watching series of beautiful vignettes. On their own, they all work but together fail to form a cohesive and engaging narrative.\n  \nLuckily I had ordered the film on demand because I actually had to pause it at around the 80 minute mark and regroup and refocus my attention as it was beginning to fade. I actually even ended up rewinding about 20 minutes because I wanted to make sure I hadn't missed something as it felt to me that I had. The transition from order to chaos and the crumbling of this highrise microcosm of society just felt as though it had come out of nowhere, even though during the first act you could feel things falling apart just beneath the surface, when things finally erupted it didn't feel earned. I understood the subtext and what it was seeking to accomplish, I still think Wheatly did a great job with certain aspects and I will probably rewatch this at some point down the road to see if I have gained any appreciation for it but as of now, my feelings remain mixed and I'd be hesitant to recommend this film to anyone outside of hardcore cinephiles.", "Saw this a while back here in the UK.\n\nHm. I think there's a discussion to be had here about book adaptations, because this was clearly a book. Does that make sense? We're conditioned to how we feel movies should be structured. And I'm the kind of person that says, \"there are no rules\" when it comes to art, so I'm torn on whether they should have meddled with the format a little for this movie adaptation. I'm not the biggest movie buff on movies before 1980, but I get the impression this would have fit well in the Nick Roeg/70s era. Are we conditioned with how movies are structured?

There is no sense of point of view, no sense of flow, no sense of identification with any of the characters.\n\nYou can argue that this is intentional, that the director is purposefully making the film in a cold way that keeps the audience distant, makes things objective and unemotional. But if the majority of people end up walking out (as they did in my cinema), you have to consider that something primal and basic isn't working.\n\nIt's as if the director shows up on set, figures out the best way to frame up the shots (and again, there are many beautiful shots), but completely fails to consider how the scenes and sequences will function in relation to each other, how they will function in context with the scenes preceding and following.\n\nThe great directors do this instinctually.

As the film progresses, his attitude changes; and his faith with his punk rock aesthetic fades as his friends begin to die. If he had any social media presence, the madness that occurred at this venue could have been avoided if the band had some form of communication to their fans. This point is driven home with other band members deciding that their deserted island bands would not be a group celebrated by the punk scene, i.e Cro-Mags/Misfits etc, but rather artists that would be chastised like Simon and Garfunkel or Prince. The chaos that punk music wraps itself around has spun out of control, leading to terrible violence and panic, which The Ain't Rights have started to reject.\n\nSame thing for Gabe. Following the murder, Gabe is a gun wielding thug taking orders from Darcy without question, but as the body count rises Gabe begins to lose faith in the white supremacist movement, resulting in his surrender to Pat and Amber and willingness to turn himself in to the police.\n\nThe final scenes with Pat confronting Darcy and Gabe searching for society are inter cut with one of the attack pitbulls searching for his owner. Right before the final confrontation, we see a sign that says \"Beware of Dog,\" seemingly signalling that this attack dog is going to follow it's orders and attack Pat or Amber. However, we find out this is only a red herring, and that the dog was simply trying to find it's owner, and that the purpose we thought the dog was going to carry out was actually false.\n\nTherefor, I find the theme of Green Room to be based around the idea that the identities we align ourselves with can change drastically depending the experiences we go through, and what we think we believe can be shaken with what we will actually do in violent scenarios, as shown through the character progression of Pat and Gabe.", "I found Anton Yelchin's character to be rather limp wristed after giving up the gun.", "I'll take \"Movies I Shouldn't Have Seen Stoned\" for 500, Alex.

First off the characters aren't unlikeable shitlords and you genuinely want them to get out alive. The gore is brutal. I'm so fed up of clean PG-13 horror with little to no gore so in this movie where I'm seeing dogs tear people's throats out and neo nazi's getting fucked up with box cutters, it's incredibly satisfying. The script is sharp, smart and likes to play with your exceptions. Like how you would expect [spoilers](#s \"Reece (The most capable of the group) to last long and he gets killed half way through the film. Or how Pat survives despite his fucked up arm.\") I adore the acting in this film which is so well done. From the main stars to even the lesser characters. They are so well performed, with Poots redeeming herself from the awful Need for speed movie. It's very well shot for a low budget film and the soundtrack was insane. Even though I think it's a little slow at the start, I fucking adore this movie and beg anyone to go see it. A flat-out masterpiece and I'm confident it will become a horror classic.

That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got us caught up in the background story; then, it gave us an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed us that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which THEN set up the stage for the reveal that incited him to attack Bucky later; AND THEN it showed what Tony Stark does in his downtime (inspire and fund clever kids and research); **AND THEN** it set the stage for the woman who confronted Tony and blamed him for the death of her son in a really clever way - she chided him with how easy it is for him to give away money and look good while causing grief and anguish on the other hand **AND AND THEN** it influenced his decisions with the regulation issue at the same time!\n\nI mean, seriously.

Neither one of them is wrong for believing in what they think is right, but it just depends on how you look at things. Even looking at the dynamic of characters like Falcon and Rhodey, two men of the U.S. Military split on this issue; Rhodey, the veteran member who has learned to trust and follow in the government while Sam, the younger member of the military still having some hope and belief in the good of people. The film just really nailed the character dynamics so damn well. \n\nThe movie had great writing, great action sequences, emotion and, more than anything, heart. Steve's belief in Bucky and the inherent good of people is such an awesome thing to watch on screen, I seriously love Chris Evans and how well he nails the character. I was also really pleased with Baron Zemo and the intelligence that they finally gave a villain, so I'm really hoping and looking forward to a future return from him as well. \n\nIn the end, I'm also okay with the consequences that came from everything. While I would like to, at some point, see writers and directors push a Marvel movie to the point where someone dies, I was happy with the choice to only paralyze Rhodey. The whole scene stems from Tony pushing too far for once. Rhodey will go to the end of the Earth for Tony, especially when they both believe in their cause, and to watch his fall happen because of his own choice was executed really well. There was nobody to blame but themselves in that situation.\n\n\nOn top of this the movie gives you so much to look forward to.\n\n*  BLACK PANTHER AND SPIDER-MAN\n* The groundwork for Vision and Wanda's romance\n* Ant-Man and The Wasp and every comedic line Paul Rudd delivers. \n* Thunderbolt Ross and the chance for Rulk\n* Vision mentioning the Infinity stone in his head and it \"not being of this world\" \n* The return of the great Helmut Zemo \n\nThe Russos nailed this.

Robert Downey Jr. with some fine ass acting making Tony Stark the three dimensional character he used to be in the comics; an utterly charismatic Falcon with an equally charismatic Anthony Mackie owning the military vibe right at the beginning; and Scarlet Johansson being the Black Widow especially in the scenes she don't fight.

It did exactly what it should--establish the new team dynamics, notably the rapport with Sam, Wanda and Steve. There was wit, with Sam's affection for his robot-bird; there was hand-to-hand; there was more mystical combat. Excellent all the way around.\n\nEverything in this movie really worked. The motivations for most of the cast were clear--oversight versus personal responsibility. And the fear of losing control. \n\nBlack Panther damn near stole the show. I doubt his screentime took up a total of an hour, but it was superb. We are introduced to him, we see his love for his father, we see his quest for vengeance, we see his willingness to do whatever it takes, and we see him come to the conclusion that, no, revenge is not worth it. This was an origin story that was beautifully executed, and it was the B-plot! And I honestly thought he was going to kill Zemo. I cannot wait for the stand-alone film!\n\nAh, Zemo. While he was no Loki, he was still a stronger villain than most of the stand-alones. He reminded me a bit of the Joker, wanting to watch the world burn, but also a bit of Two-face, seeing as he is consumed by revenge.

The rest of the action scenes were fine.\n\nAlmost everything else about the movie was awesome.", "So I loved this movie. That said, I feel really strange about how it treated Tony, especially towards the end. After the airport fight, Natasha berates Tony for having a massive ego, but he's the one trying to keep the team together and keep them in check through outside balancing. Doesn't that mean he's actively ignoring his ego? And in the Raft, Clint and/or Wilson take jabs at him for causing Rhodey to fall and nearly die. But that was actively Wilson's fault (and Vision's to a degree). Even in the end, Tony is actively helping Rogers and it turns out Rogers was keeping the fact that Bucky killed the Starks from him (which, also, when did Cap find that out?). \n\nIt's like for once Tony is the one not being reckless and trying to take some responsibility for his actions and everyone just shits on him for it, even people on his side, like Natasha. Even that last scene where Rogers sends him the message saying that he'll come if Tony calls, as if Rogers has the moral high ground. Sure, he was technically correct, but the entire point of the pact was that the Avengers acting on their own are reckless and take needless risks. In this film, an airport had to be evacuated and millions of dollars of damage was caused because Rogers spent more time looking out for  Bucky than he did for his own team. Hell, Rhodes nearly gets killed because of Rogers' and Bucky's actions. In some sense, it treats Tony losing control at the end like he's the bad guy here. Despite the fact that, you know, Bucky killed his parents.\n\nIt's an amazing testament to this movie that I feel this conflicted about how it treated Stark. It just seems that the movie respects the Cap's viewpoint more than Stark's when I think it should have been more neutral.

Of course you need the same actors for Ratchet and Clank, but the money they spent on Giamatti, Goodman, Stallone, and Dawson could've been much better served on getting better writers.

If you weren't and none of their sketches didn't do anything for you, you should take a pass as this won't do anything for you. I think they've refined a lot. I hope that this does well because I think their next feature would be amazing. They're fine tuning their craft and they hit a lot of notes, but not all of them.

I was wary (despite the all star cast) that this would turn out to be underwhelming for a live action rendition but I am happy to see my worries stifled, much like the red flower.  \n  \n**A few things that stuck out to me:**  \n  \nKing Louie was much more sinister than I recall from the animated Disney version. I was impressed with the attention to detail when the director was building tension (such as Louie's hair being left behind as he arose due to having remained in his throne for such a long time undisturbed).  \n.  \nMy boyfriend and I were both floored with how emotionally we reacted to the Bear Necessities. I was worried Bill Murray was a miscast (I recall some saying John Goodman would have been better and at first I agreed). The rapport was very organic between a na\u00efve child and a cunning (yet oafish) bear.  \n.  \nSher Khan's story about the cuckoo (and subsequent scene transition featuring one) was incredibly well done. It was tense, yet innocuous on the surface. The perfect balance to instill doubt without spoon feeding the audience with the metaphor.  \n  .    \nI could go on, however, just as a side note, I found both the porcupine and the pangolin's personalities to be quite endearing. A great amount of comedic relief without being overbearing.   \n  \nAs another side note, the little dialogue between Baloo and Mowgli discussing \"Propaganda\" (regarding the wolves creed) was adorable. I audibly laughed, just as a young girl asked her mother just moments after that exchange \"what IS propaganda?\". My boyfriend and I couldn't help but wonder what the best way to explain propaganda to a young child would be, not unlike our protagonists.  \n  \n.  \n  \nOverall, we both really loved the movie. My boyfriend had no idea what he was getting into, as he didn't see any trailers or hear much about its existence. I saw the trailers and was wary, but I'm glad I knew about it as I went into it with low expectations and left with them exceeded.  \n.  \n  \n**Edit**: I wrongfully thought Louie was in the book. Redacted that commentary. ", "For a contemporary blockbuster this is a remarkably patient film. In order to instill in its audience the sort of wonder it ultimately summons, it allows itself to linger on small moments most modern blockbusters have no time for, so that by the end of the film, we know the Law of the Jungle as well as Mowgli and his pack, and we care that Shere Kahn has threatened it.\n\nOf course none of that would be possible without the extraordinary work of the bajillion CG artists who worked to make this film as stunning as it is. It's easy to heap praise on the voice actors, who all certainly did amazing jobs, but their performances came to vivid life thanks to those artists.\n\nI know some people didn't like the intrusion of the songs, but this movie is like a myth, and its songs are the most vivid reminders of the timelessness of this story.\n\nThis movie simultaneously made me proud to be human, and encouraged me to remember my responsibility to nature. I had a classic Disney experience.\n\nTL;DR: got high, LOVED the movie\n", "If you think about it... a big theme of this movie is a people (the wolves) coming to accept a person who is from somewhere else and isn't quite like them (Mowgli) for who he is, and realizing it's better to celebrate him for who he is rather than trying to force him to be like everyone else or leave. I don't know about you, but i'm happy that that's a story being told nowadays, especially considering some of the worlds biggest issues right now.", "king louie needed more cowbell", "Ohhh oh yeah exfoliate me!", "Easily one of the best movies to come from Disney. Unbelievably brilliant CGI. \n\nDefinitely going for a second time! ", "Can we take a moment to admit that Shere Khan is really the tragic hero of this movie? Spoilers ahead.\n\nSeriously though, all this guy really wants to do is protect his home from getting burned down. Everyone fully admits that man is destructive and talks about them burning down the fucking forest. But naw, this guy's cool. And you know what this little fucker does? He burns down the fucking forest! And after we have very clearly proved that Khan was right all along, they band together and fucking kill the poor bastard. What do the fucking wolves care, they live up on fucking pride rock, why would they give a fuck if the forest burns down? Shere Khan was sticking up for the working middle-class forest creatures against wolf pack tyranny.\n\nJungle Book represents everything that is truly wrong about society. Khan shows up, everyone cowers in fear at the sight of him. You know what that does to someone after a long time? Here's a place where everyone is supposed to be equal, but no, not the fucking tiger. Bunch of fucking racists. I mean the guy clearly has PTSD and instead of getting him the help that he needs they villainize him. Did Zootopia teach us nothing? #TigerLivesMatter\n\nYou know what, don't worry about it Mowgli, 80% of our home is gone, but since you came in with the fucking mute elephants and put the fire out we're totally fucking chill. Bullshit. All of this could have been prevented if they had just killed that little shit from the get-go.\n\n\\#ShereKhanDidNothingWrong", "I like this movie and this movie one of my favorite movies so far in 2016. The Voice cast were good and convincing from the Kaa, Baloo, to Shere Khan.\n\nI don't have any problem if Disney took this approach for their upcoming live-action adaptations. It is a success with this movie and Cinderella. This approach may straight forward but they added some dimensions and properly executed those movie.\n\nAlso, Neel Sethi as Mowgli was amazing and it is not easy to for a child actor to act in front of green screen for the entire movie.", "So, overall, I really enjoyed it. \n\nI was absolutely blown away by the animation. It's probably the most realistic stuff I've ever seen in a movie, *maybe* excluding Avatar. \n\nI'm not joking when I say the animals actually looked real (for the most part). There was some stuff that didn't quite mesh well, mostly during the shots where characters and environments are moving or shifting around quickly, but those moments were few and far between.\n\nThe acting was really solid as well. Idris Elba, Ben Kinglsey, and Bill Murray were pretty much perfect in every way. Christopher Walken was...himself, which is pretty great. \n\nNeel Sethi, I thought, did a really good job. Some of his lines felt a bit forced or over acted, but he nailed the physicality of Mowgli. It's definitely not easy for a kid his age to act on a sound stage with that much green/blue screen happening around him, so props to Favreau for really pushing his performance to the max. \n\nI think the biggest problem I had was the editing. Some of it just felt really strangely paced and timed, specifically in the climax, which felt *really* drawn out. \n\nThe songs were...weird. I think that's because there's only two, and the first one, 'Bare Necessities', doesn't come in until well past the start of the second act. To me, it seemed out of place with the how the rest of the movie played out. Maybe that's just because I'm used to the old cartoon version. \n\nBut again, overall, I really enjoyed it. Super solid work all around from the cast and from the incredible artists who made the animals and the world almost literally come to life. \n\nEdit: I only saw it in 2D, so I have no idea if the 3D adds anything significant. If what I heard it true, then it's like a whole other movie and really something special. ", "I really loved this movie. It still had the child story vibe but Favreau adapted it super well. He knew which parts of the story were vital and which could be kept out. I think one of the biggest things was how he gave Shere Khan more depth than the old animated film did. \n\nThe visual effects are as good as everyone is making them out to be and it really baloo (hah...) me away. Aside from some of the smaller animals (flying squirrels, etc.) everything looked phenomenal and all of the main big animals and the setting looked as real as ever. \n\nFor me, I think the voice acting is what sold me on it all. I think each character was perfectly cast and the voices were exactly how I would expect each animal to talk if I were thinking about it in my head as well as based on what the old animated feature gave us. \n\nThe Jungle Book was always one of, if not, my favorite stories as a kid and I'm just happy that Jon Favreau could take advantage of the tools and technology today and bring this to life like we've never seen before. The movie is a ton of fun, especially if you are a fan of the classic and there are a ton of great moments. Favreau has always been great, but he seriously ups his cred with each new movie he puts out. ", "Disney has really been killing it with their recent films. Such a gorgeous film, really nice story, and great acting all around. Really loved the elephants and King Louie.", "Wow, this was such a fun film to watch.\n\nFirst off, yes the CGI was fantastic and totally engrossing. If you want a pretty movie to watch this is one of the prettiest I've seen in a good bit.\n\nI think most of the voice acting was spot on. Lupita Nyong'o has some great, emotionally filled scenes. Other times she seems a bit wooden. Scarlett Johansson was also good, but her scene was kind of unnecessary imo.\n\nOtherwise every other voice actor does their job perfectly. Kingsley as Baheera brings that wise presence to the film, Idris Elba is terrifying as Shere Khan, Bill Murray is just hilarious as Baloo, he has quite a few great jokes. Giancarlo Esposito didn't have much to say, but when he did it felt like a wise father figure.\n\nAnd Chrisopher Walken as King Louie... maybe the best casting in the whole movie. He perfectly encapsulates everything I remember King Louie being in the original film. He stole the movie for the brief time he was in it.\n\nNow Neel Sethi as Mowgli. Look, he doesn't steal any scenes and he's not great sometimes. In fact he has a couple of parts where you can tell he's just really, really inexperienced as an actor. But, I give this kid credit for the job he had to do acting across virtually nothing for the whole film. He gets a passing grade from me though.\n\nThe story is actually surprisingly well done. It doesn't vary much from the animated film, but it's more like a puffed up version. It has these little twists that make it entirely its own while still feeling familiar.\n\nMusic is great. Hearing Bill Murray and Christopher Walken sing will never not bring me joy.\n\nAlso, I really, really liked the way they handled Mowgli's character. You'll know what I mean when you see it. They give us little sprinkles of info about him early on that end up paying off gradually through the film until finally it becomes a huge part of who he is. I was very impressed with how Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks gave Mowgli some layers as a character that I didn't think the animated film version had.\n\nOverall, this is by far the best of these new Disney \"live action\" films yet. And I say that as someone who enjoyed the Cinderella remake.", "This was and remains my all-time favorite animated Disney movie, and Favreau nailed it. \n\nSo many nostalgic moments for me. The opening incorporating that mysterious, dark score from the animated film. The backdrop of Mowgli and Bagheera walking against the waterfall. The moonlight shining on the river after King Louie's temple collapsed. They found clever ways to weave the songs in, giving it a unique twist despite using the same lyrics. \n\nI think John Debney did a great job weaving the songs into his score too, though the soundtrack certainly sounded like a mesh of many different movies I've heard recently. The score when the elephants diverted the river flow was a particular emotional highlight for me. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the interpretation. Shere Khan and the expanded role of the wolves was great. The Akela death shocked me, especially. Kaa revealing Mowgli's past added exposition in a clever, interesting way. \n\nI loved Murray and Kingsley as Baloo and Bagheera, though the bond between Mowgli and Baloo didn't really gel for me, as much as it did in the animated film. Such that Baloo \"breaking\" the news to Mowgli lacked emotional impact. I also found some of the scenes of Mowgli running toward the beginning and the final confrontation between Shere Khan and the animals to be disorienting. \n\nBut when that book closed at the end, I could hardly hold back my tears, as it evoked so many memories of watching this as a child. Well done Jon Favreau, the VFX/CGI crew, the voice actors, and all the other supporting crew.", "I really really liked Scarlet Johansson as Kaa \n\nHer singing the song during the credits was so, so soothing, I wouldn't even mind if she killed me...", "The CGI blew my mind. Everything that you see on screen except for Neel Sethi is computer generated. I couldn't get my head around it for a while. ", "Cowbell brings out King Walken...\n\n\nHmmmm\n", "Christopher Walken brought so much to King Louie with just his voice. The warmth, the ego, the incredible intimidation. \n\nThe voice acting was just all around impressive. ", "If Zathura and Chef didn't convince you already that Favreau is great at directing children, this movie did.\n\nFun fact: the kid from Chef actually voices one of the wolf cubs in this movie.", "If I had Idris Elba's voice, I'd never fucking shut up. He fucking killed it. \r\n\r\nWalken was great too. I didn't like Bill Murray as Baloo much though. \r\n\r\nThe mixing is much better in the movie. I was worried since I felt it was off in the trailers. \r\n\r\nKinda felt it was stupid that the animals rallied behind Mowgli after the fire though, Shere Khan was right. But eh, the movie was still pretty cool.", "Did anyone else really appreciate King Louie's badass Apocalypse Now introduction?", "This was excellent. Now give me a state-of-the-art adaption of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, please and thank you.", "Great movie. Some of the CGI seemed so life-like - the grass/tree sets - that I was convinced Disney used real sets as a point of reference. They probably were just real but I really hope it was CGI, because WOW.\n\nThought more time could have been spent on the Mowgli/Baloo relationship prior to him telling Mowgli to leave, but the rapport they had was excellent and Murray was, of course, great. \"I Wanna be Like You\" also felt quite forced and tonally awkward (Louie was all angry and intimidating while this boppy music played up...?). Think it would have worked better in just the credits alone, because Walken's performance itself was awesome.\n\nEverything else was excellent. Disney once again proving that they're the smartest studio in Hollywood.", "Absolutely loved it! Breathtakingly beautiful animation. Usually I get annoyed when they show-horn A-listers to voice act to capitalize on their name, but the cast was phenomonal. I especially loved Ben Kingsley as Bagheera. One of my favorite Disney characters as a kid, and I loved how they showed him fight Shere Khan. When I was younger that was something that I always wanted to see and I never understood why they never interacted. We see Baloo's fatherly devotion and love for Mowgli in that he stands up and fights Shere Khan and I always was bummed how Bagheera didn't do the same. Favorite movie of this year so far\n\n9.5/10", "Was it just me that supported Sherkhan considering the developments that Man has made in the Jungle worlds destroying their habitats?", "Loved the film and thought it was a great achievement in CGI but I'm not sure if the kids will enjoy it. The tone is a sandwich of dark and scary. So much so that when it gets to the fun and lighthearted Baloo segments which got some honest laughs from me, I had to reengage with the movie because it simply didn't resemble the tension and terror the previous 40 or so minutes held.", "I thought it was beautiful, and well directed. I thought the acting was pretty brilliant, but...I left so dissatisfied.\n\nThey Disneyfied Disney. Seriously. It drove me NUTS that Mowgli gets to stay in the jungle. The whole point of the story is that he HAS to leave because it isn't safe - not just for him, but for the rest of the animals. Man is not compatible with the jungle, nor is the jungle compatible with man. I would have thought there was a good conservationist moral to be made there, in a fun, and inspiring way, but they totally missed it...\n\nLikewise, the idea that Mowgli is lured into the man-village by a pretty young girl could have been interesting, if they symbolically linked her to the elephants. She bends her arms, and draws furrows into the earth to redirect some water into her basin, showing that yes, man has the power of destruction in the red flower, but can also bend the earth to gentle, symbiotic purpose with water. Like the elephants. It just seemed like a missed opportunity.\n\nLikewise, although I LOVED Elba's performance, I am one of the few unhappy with the fact that his accent wasn't standardised RP. I thought by having him sound like a cultured aristocrat, there could have been some interesting comments made about British Imperialism. Shere Khan with the voice of an English gentleman deliberately, and consciously stepping into the territories of other animals and oppressing them sort of how the British, you know, went into India. The wolves as the loyal, but unimaginative military force. Bagheera is the native officer who speaks like an Englishman but is never afforded the same respect. Mowgli as the outsider who loves a place, and can belong to two places, but can't force his own culture on another...\n\nIt just seemed like...I don't know, there was more that could have been said, more depth to have been exposed than there was. Not necessarily in the way I laid out, but it did all feel a bit shallow to me.\n\nAlso, this version was much less cut-throat than even the cartoon. It just felt gutless. I don't mean that I need blood and mangled corpses, but there were no stakes because no one was in danger of dying. Akela only did because it served to advance the plot, but death can also advance the themes that were in play, and because none happened (outside of Akela) there didn't really seem to be any danger.\n\nBagheera and Baloo are swiping at monkeys, and lying on them, and the monkeys get up, shake out their fur and run off. They don't even seem stunned. Fire burns through the jungle, but no one is ever seriously in danger. It doesn't even come close. Why should I care about the danger inherent in Mowgli's presence, or Shere Khan's actions, or marvel at the power of the jungle if there is none to be had?\n\nALSO Kaa - Kaa is totally shoehorned in. Why not, at the end of the story, reveal that Kaa slithered up, and devoured Mowgli's father, thus giving her presence there a purpose, and making her complicit in Mowgli's disenfranchisement?\n\nAnd then, at other times, the script resorted to cheap cliches for no reason. Like when Baloo tries to drive Mowgli off by saying he means nothing to him? It was a cheap emotional ploy. Mowgli STILL would have been upset enough to go off and sulk had Baloo calmly, and politely told him he had to go, and why. No need to be a dick about it in the most cliche way possible.\n\nJust...I don't know. It was extraordinary in some ways, but it didn't thrill me. It didn't give me the shivers.", "Loved it! though surprised the ending where he goes to the village was specifically left out, and I'm curious as to why... though assume it's for the sequel. edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OlIvMhnJkQ\n\n(http://i.imgur.com/wbISXdY.jpg / http://i.imgur.com/buCZjOa.jpg) \n\nHave Favreau/Marks spoken to this yet?\n\nI was anticipating it, and was looking forward to how they'd do it, but the movie didn't end with the girl fetching water and flirting with Mowgli, luring him into the village ultimately. Instead it ends just before that scene, when Bagheera, Mowgli and Baloo are celebrating (on a tree together, in this case \u2013 which was adorable, yes, obviously).\n\nSo are they having Mowgli stay in the jungle for the sequel? Would have been cool to see this scene play out in this new world, but if it's coming in a sequel I suppose maybe that's just as fine. But I like the bittersweet ending where he ultimately leaves the jungle, to stop playing, and grow up and discover new things.\n\nThat's my only question/curiosity/complaint. It was a fun movie!", "Wow, what a fantastic surprise. I haven't loved a Disney movie like that in a long time. I think it's better than the animated version, which is such a fantastic feat for a 2016 remake. I can't wait to see it again. It's a shame this won't be considered for best animated movie of the year, because man, would this have been hard to beat.", "Man, that bear was really awesome. He's really killing it this year after the revenant. \n\nI don't know who they want to play Pooh in the live action Winnie the Pooh film but he's gotta be on the list at least.", "Minority opinion here apparently, but the movie didn't do much for me. It wasn't infuriating but there were few if any real stand out moments. King Louie was great, Bill Murray did a good job, as did Elba, but overall it didn't leave that much of an impact.  It takes some elements from the books, that gave it it's gothic mythic nature but not enough so it just feels stuck between the Disney whimsy and it. \n\nI also thought the happy ending was a little too cheesey for the Jungle Book  and didn't make sense. Uniting the Jungle was never really a thing. Plus Mowgali gives up the fire when he sees how he's causing destruction the way a man does, but then fights Shere Khan with fire so that just seemed pointless.  Neel Sethi's acting left a lot to be desired too. \n\nI don't think it's terrible, just not very memorable. Nothing made me laugh out loud or really got me in the heart. \n\nPlus they mispronounced every Hindi word they used so that was really annoying. ", "All right, time to be that asshole... this movie is just okay. And I'm a huge Jon Favreau fan. But a 94% RT movie this is not.\n\nLet's start with the good. Like the other recent Disney remakes, this film makes a decent attempt to differentiate itself from its animated predecessor. Making Mogwli an internally-troubled engineer (so to speak) was an awesome creative choice, particularly when he saves the baby elephant to John Debney's \"Bare Necessities\"-inspired score. That was one of the few times the movie successfully wove musical nostalgia in a way that worked (more on this later).\n\nAdditionally, with all this talk about the animation, I will say that the filmmakers did a phenomenal job in making us buy the existence of talking animals. A goofy bear voiced by Bill Murray could have felt out of place in a live-action movie. But the filmmakers instead made the animals realistic enough to be impressive but cartoonish enough to avoid the uncanny valley when they talk. You can\u2019t make a talking bear as realistic as say the Revenant bear, but this attempt is as good as it gets. R.I.P. Garry Shandling as well.\n\nNow the bad.\n\nThe pacing and editing for this film are incredibly awkward. Baloo is introduced, develops a friendship with Mogwli, and breaks off the friendship in a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d clich\u00e9 all in less than half an act. King Louie somehow knows of the death of Akela while the communication between different animals with different languages remains unclear. Mogwli somehow sets the entire jungle on fire instantaneously with one torch. These are just a few examples of the film\u2019s oddities, on top of all the various sequences dully drawn out or rapidly chopped together.\n\nNow, here\u2019s the point I get downvoted\u2026 the actor playing Mogwli does not do a very good job, despite comments to the contrary. I hate saying that because after The Last Airbender disaster, any time Hollywood casts a child actor of the correct race should be applauded. But here the kid overacts and often times looks confused about what he\u2019s acting toward. Not his fault, though. This is what happens when you take a boy less than 10 with no acting experience and throw him into an all-green-screen movie. I\u2019m sure it was challenging, but with a $175 million budget, couldn\u2019t we have given this kid a couple more shots at some of the key lines? I\u2019d say bring on Andy Serkis as a motion capture coach, but of course he\u2019s making his own Jungle Book movie.\n\nThe screenplay also fails to give Mogwli an interesting personality. Look at the animated movie. Mogwli moves around like an animal, scruffs down bananas without manners, whines and moans\u2026 not a perfect character, but at least there\u2019s someone cynical for the positive Baloo can bounce off of. It\u2019s interesting to watch. Here Baloo is part con artist bouncing off of a kid who has zero personality. Imagine if Mogwli bit back at Baloo\u2019s comments as well as build the mechanism to bring down the honeycombs? You would have had a dynamic buddy relationship more interesting to listen to and watch than the animated movie. Alas, it falters instead.\n\nFinally, the movie awkwardly tries to combine elements from the original book and the animated film together and suffers from it. \u201cBare Necessities\u201d sung off key by Bill Murray is unnecessary. King Louie singing \u201cI Wanna Be Like You\u201d makes even less sense \u2013 he\u2019s Disney-invented character, but uses the term \u201cred flower\u201d from the book, but then sings the lyrics \u201cred fire\u201d in his Disney-written song. The up-down inconsistency was grating.\n\nOverall, Jon Favreau\u2019s Jungle Book is vastly overrated movie. An admirable attempt to be sure, but not the must-see event it\u2019s making itself out to be. Ball\u2019s in your court, Andy Serkis.", "[deleted]", "Quick question, is it worth watching it in 3D? The last movie I really enjoyed watching in 3D was Coraline. ", "I saw it tonight, and I gotta say: this is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. The CGI is breathtakingly dazzling and the voice cast is exquisitely cast. I have a hard time remembering the last time I was so thoroughly engrossed in the world-building a movie had created. I honestly can't wait to see this again.\n\nI saw it in 3D, and if you can \u2014 GO SEE IT IN 3D. It was mesmerizing. Each element onscreen popped and made for a wonderful experience. Absolutely worth the extra money, and that's the first time I can remember saying that about 3D.", "Can we just take a moment and appreciate how brilliant Giancarlo Esposito was in the film? The voice was so authorative and yet so kind. *\"... But most importantly, we now have peace.\"*\n\nSaw this movie in 3D and I'd highly recommend it, much against reddit.com popular opinion. Had all of the hall slack jawed and at the edge of their seats from start to finish. ", "When they first showed us Kaa I was wondering how they would do the hypno eyes and man, it was awesome. lol ", "This is the 2016 visual equivalent of what Avatar was in 2009.  The 3D is so incredibly worth it and it's a great new take on a classic story.", "I was squeeing internally at how cute the wolves and the wolf puppies were", "King Louie's song made me go \"wait, what?\" Like, he's basically threatening to murder this child and suddenly you hear the opening bars of his song start up. It's quite a bouncy and upbeat song too. I almost burst out laughing at the tonal whiplash.\n\nI appreciated the wolves getting a larger role in this film. Their role in raising Mowgli was one of my favorite concepts about the book and the animated film kinda glossed over it. It helped that Mowgli's mother was one of the most endearing characters in it to me. \n\nI do question how Shere Khan seems to be invincible in this movie. How accurate is such a power level for a jungle tiger? It was awesome, don't get me wrong, but still.", "Saw the movie last week in regular 2d. And I must say that I wasn't impressed. I'm not sure what I expected from this movie, but definitely not what I saw. First of all, the visuals were great for the most part. Obviously, the most attention was paid to main characters and their animation, so most other creatures looked a bit fake. The best animated and looking ones were Bagheera and Shere Khan, Balu felt bit fakey in my opinion. Wolves looked the worst of the bunch and had little emotion on their faces in comparison to other main animals. The cinematography was pretty nice for the most part, some really creative visuals here and there but aside from few scenes nothing much stands out in my mind. Don't want to spoil anything, but few scenes at the end of the movie were pretty breathtaking.\n\nThe kid that played Mowgli is alright. He's not terrible, but he's not very good either. I never bought him as a kid of the jungle, though, but considering that all he had to work with is green screen I think he did alright. He looked the part, that's for sure.\n\nThe thing that disappointed and underwhelmed me the most is the story. Yeah, I know some of you will say that it's just a kids' movie, what do you expect and the original wasn't that smart and so on, and all I can answer is that it's not an excuse. This movie felt shallow. Like really, really shallow and it felt underdeveloped. First of all, with new more realistic visuals the viewer expects a bit more realism in workings of the world. I can buy talking animals, I can buy singing animals, but what I can't buy is the kid who lived all his life in a jungle among feral animals who never shows any signs of it, never acts like an animal (aside from like one short moment in the whole movie) and overall just feels like just a human that just got lost in a jungle for one weekend. I know it was like that in the original movie, but that was a silly comedy that never made pretense that it's somehow serious. This movie really wanted to be smarter and more serious, but it missed its chance completely. You can suspense the disbelief only so much until it breaks. And it breaks hard right from the beginning. Kids' acting certainly didn't help, but I must say that he acted like a kid and never felt more advanced that he looked, which is rare among child characters in movies.\n\nThe plot was a bit more coherent and developed than the one from the original movie, but had little of that Disney trademark heart in it. The emotional moments rang hollow, because the movie never bothered to make a viewer sympathise or relate to Mowgli. He's a very simple character. He's just a kid who wants to stay in the jungle. That's it. There's little to no conflict or development in him. He almost never acts on his own and things just kinda happen to him and he gets thrown from one place to another, from one setpiece into another. He's boring. So is the movie, at least the first half. The first third, until Mowgli meets Balu contains plenty of cringeworthy moments (yeah, Disney family movies usually have plenty of them, but they usually feel genuine and with a heart in the right place) and was pretty boring. Lots of stuff happens that you, as a viewer, has no reason to care about because you had no chance to get invested in it. The story was very, very simple. A saturday morning cartoon kinda simple. There are no interesting themes being brought up, nothing of the sorts. Not entirely bad thing, but not enough for this movie's runtime, so there's a lot of padding.\n\nBalu saves this movie. He isn't particularly funny, but he's likeable and brings much-needed silliness to the overall proceedings and gives the movie a second breath. He's a good addition to the story and makes it more lighthearted and fun. His song was also really nice and adds a lot to the movie. So does King Louie. He's the best part of the movie. I kid you not. He's menacing, he's interesting, he's awesome. And his song is so much fun, even if it starts from out of almost nowhere. I liked him a lot and his setpiece is very enjoyable to watch. Shere Khan is meh. Sure, his animation is spectacular and he can be pretty frightening, but he's just as shallow as any of them. You have no reason to care for him, out of sympathy or an interest. Looks cool, but he mostly does nothing throughout the movie outside of growling and looking menacing. Still, his scenes are enjoyable enough, especially at the end. Bagheera is a nice mentor figure, but there isn't much more to him.\n\nCinderella gave the tired old story new, fresh blood by adding much needed complexity into the story and its characters. Not the whole lot, but it was on point and made it much more enjoyable. It had plenty of heart and a lot of Disney's trademark magic. This one tries to do the same, but trips over its own tail constantly. It's like nobody knew what to do with it. Make it gritty or make it silly, make it dark or make it fun. It's a mess. When it works, it works brilliantly, when it doesn't it's just boring. Maybe if I watched the English version I'd like it more, but I'm not sure that good voice actors can save a lame story. Maybe I expected too much from this movie and wanted an epic journey full of perils and challenges, interesting story and characters. I probably should've known better.\n\nIt's not a bad movie and it's certainly watchable, but it's not very good either. If you love the original one you'll probably like this one too. It might be the best The Jungle Book out there, though, whatever that counts for. Usually Disney movies leave me feeling really good about myself and the world, this one left me with nothing. Btw, that awesome Bare Necessities music from the trailers isn't used in the movie until the very end for one small sequence. Major letdown. Also, the trailers showed every major setpiece in the movie. The theater was full of kids and they laughed all the time, so they probably liked the movie a whole lot.\n\nTL;DR It was underwhelming. \n", "I wasn't really a fan of this. I felt like Neel Sethi was a pretty bad actor, and some of the delivery was pretty weak.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous mostly, but there are some points where the live action and CGI just doesn't mix well. It seems to end up feeling fake at points.\n\nThe voice cast was good though, and the saving factor. Bill Murray and Idris Elba were probably the best part.", "CGI done right looks incredible. ", "So I don't think this will be seen by anyone, but I am extremely surprised at how much /r/movies is loving this film.  I found it really underwhelming, especially compared to the praise it's getting.\n\nThe story and arc are extremely weak.  Just like the original, it's basically a series of loosely connected vignettes.\n\nIt's dangerous to center your film around a child actor acting opposite of CGI creations.  I understand that it's necessary for The Jungle Book, but the acting did not work for me.\n\nThe jungle literally has two women: Raksha and Kaa.  That's it.  Practically every other character that has a speaking role was male.\n\nThe two songs were wildly out of place.  Neither Bill Murray nor Christopher Walken are known for their singing prowess.  Nothing visually interesting or fun happens in those moments.  The movie just comes to a screeching halt to give us the two songs we remember from the original.\n\nThe animal CGI was admittedly very impressive.  The sheer 3D spectacle and scale were both pretty good (though nowhere near Avatar, as some have claimed).\n\nI don't know what I expected.  This is exactly what I would have pictured from a live-action Disney Jungle Book, and yet all the rave reviews convinced me it was something more.  There's definitely some things to like, but I don't understand the \"one of the best Disney movies ever\" sentiment.  Zootopia came out literally six weeks ago, to say nothing of the past 80 years of classics.", "I watched the original Jungle Book over and over as a kid and this movie made me feel so damn nostalgic I almost shed a tear when they sang Bear(Bare?) Necessities. I'm really glad that they kept the songs from the originals but I still prefer the originals tho because King Louie wasn't as wacky(he's also goddamn huuuuuge). \n\nThe overall voice cast was excellent but I personally didn't think ScarJo was the best choice for Kaa.\n\nsolid 8/10.", "Really enjoyed this movie, it's visually amazing, incredible cgi, great voice acting, and it was a very fun expirience, defenitley gonna watch it again in imax", "Ok, the people in this thread are taking crazy pills.  The movie sucked, and here's why:\n\n-Mowgli's acting was fucking garbage.\n\n-The animal cgi was good, but the facial/mouth cgi was awful.  And for those of you saying that facial capture is a waste of time, you are just wrong.\n\n-King Louie was waaay too big, like, why the fuck is King Kong in this movie?  His hand is literally the size of Mowgli.  Orangutans do not get that big - what a joke.\n\n-The songs were not well conceived.  I kinda get how Baloo's song comes into play when they're chilling, floating down the river, but King Louie's song during a moment of intense drama was totally out of place.  If they were going to include 2 songs from the original, why not include more, why make inconsistent use of them, why force Christopher Walken to sing at all when his voice is complete shit?  If they wanted songs at all, it should have only been Baloo's song, but really, I don't think they should have had any songs.  Just stick to turning the songs into dialogue like the scene with Kaa, which was actually well done.\n\n-They totally blew the ending of the movie by keeping Mowgli in the jungle rather than him being enticed back into human civilization.  It sets up an obvious cash grab for sequels and totally undermines one of the strongest statements of the original movie that there are natural forces that drive like species to each other out of necessity (sexuality, social solidarity, instinct, etc.).\n\nI have even more issues with the movie, but these are the major ones.  Hopefully people sorting by controversial will see my opinion because I know there are some like-minded people out there.  If you want to see a good Disney movie, go out and see Zootopia, or rent the new Cinderella, which were both excellent movies.  Cheers.", "The fact that this entire movie was shot on a sound stage in Los Angeles is incredible. The whole time I was trying to figure out what was real and what wasn't and there is not a single scene in the movie where you can tell something is real vs. CGI unless you know it would be physically impossible for it to be real (AKA: talking animals).

But still, it was just really taking me out the movie how bad it was.\n\nI was honestly expecting to come here and see at least a divide, but this is overwhelmingly positive stuff and I just don't get it.\n\nIts a really strange feeling to be honest.

He has had a lot of practice playing these weird emotionless characters. But I was also surprised at how much I liked Chris Cooper in this film. I could really relate to him, as a father. I am used to Cooper playing much smaller roles, mostly.\n\nThe kid was also pretty great.\n\nThe film had a nice balance of comedy and drama. I teared up a bit near the end, but my baby rode her first carousel literally a week ago, so it affected me. I also teared up when Davis finally cried. \n\nAs for any issues, I feel like the film didn't have enough closure. Technically all the plotlines had reached important points, but I just wanted some more with Watts/Lewis. Clearly him getting beat up allowed their relationship to be restored like she wanted, but I would have liked some after math. Or to see what happened with Karen and Davis.\n\nAlso, Watts felt really underused in this film. She is a big time actress. Oscar nominated, but her character didn't do a whole lot for me.\n\nStill like the movie and would recommend it. \n\nNon fun fact - In Gyllenhaal's last three movies, either he or his wife have died. \n\nYou can read my [full review here!](http://gorgview.com/demolition) :)", "Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance. He has a good chemistry with Watts. \n\nBut actually, actually, and the film is not very explicit about it, the relationship between Karen and Davis is not the most important one of the movie. It is not an actual love story. It is more like a conduit. Director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e doesn\u2019t even show any intimacy between those two. Instead, Karen\u2019s son Chris is struggling through puberty and is also looking for himself, and Davis joins him. Together they help each other and Gyllenhaal and Lewis have a great on-screen connection.\n\nI really like that setup. \n\nAgain, Vallee produces a very strong and touching psychological movie with a phenomenal script. Man, those Quebecois directors are some of the best ones working in Hollywood today (see also Denis Villeneuve).\n\nI also like how Demolition doesn\u2019t explain anything clearly, but everything that happens needs an interpretation of Davis\u2019 emotional state. Davis is annoyed about everything that doesn\u2019t function properly and demolishes his computer and the toilet door at the office. In fact, he is acting out and wants to demolish himself. He even tells Karen: \u201cSuddenly, everything is a metaphor. A fallen tree, that\u2019s my life. Bad weather, I am the cold front coming in.\u201d\n\nThis is an intelligent film that expertly explores the human emotions and personal growth, and it funny at the same time. High praise to Vall\u00e9e for the directing and for Gyllenhaal and Watts for the acting.\n\nFor a more expansive review, here is my [review blog](https://jeroenthoughts.wordpress.com/2016/04/07/demolition-2015/).", "I really liked the first hour of this movie, but I thought the third act felt quite rushed and avalanched too much melodrama on the viewer; the baby, the fact it wasn't his, the driver, and Naomi Watts being single.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a high 6/10. Definitely not as good as it could've been, but a unique character study and well-acted and directed. The editing was really on point as well.", "I haven't seen Vallee's other films but I really enjoyed the style and feel of this one.\n\nI thought it had a lot of unconventional elements. I liked that Karen and Davis never actually hooked up. The twist with the station wagon also caught me off guard. I enjoyed the comedy as well. The scene where he pictures himself getting an MRI reminded me of scrubs where JD imagines ridiculous scenarios. It also had a great soundtrack. Some songs I haven't heard in years. Excellent acting, that kid was incredible.\n\nThis film also had a lot of five o'clock shadow Gyllenhaal in suits and raybans. As a lady, I was quite pleased. Solid B.", "I loved this movie.

No pun intended. It'll probably end up being my Ex Machina or Blue Ruin of 2016. You know, that movie from a talented indie director that doesn't disappoint and quietly ends up to on your top ten of the year.\n\nThis movie had great tension from the very first scene. I loved how little the trailer gave us. It was basically an interesting retelling of Superman but seemed so much more human than any movie like it. The emotional highs in this movie were so well done. I got so emotional every time Dunst, Shannon, and the kid were together. Edgerton envying the family they have and all of them knowing it would be torn apart soon. And the tension on the action sequences like the falling satellite or when the church henchmen attack them at the motel. Just all so well done.\n\nAnother thing I liked was the main henchman for the church. The electrician. He could have been played as this mysterious badass but instead had this sad confusion since he's never been asked to do something like this. He just had to step up for what he believed in. Really interesting character.\n\nI also appreciate the jump scares in this movie. Just several moments where the tension exploded perfectly in a few scenes.\n\nI think the main complaints are going to be about the end. But I loved the ending. I think realistic sci fi and fantasy are an uphill battle with critics. Nobody wants to concretely know what the mystery is but nobody wants ambiguity either. For what it's worth, I thought the scene where everyone in the southeast got to see the other world for a few minutes was amazing. Such a great moment. \n\nAnyways yeah. Loved the movie.", "I wanted to like this movie *a lot* more than I did. I enjoyed the suspense and I did have a sense of awe at the end. I love a good movie with an unstructured/bare-bones narrative, but *Midnight Special* just left a little too much in question. It's okay to leave questions unanswered, but only if at the end the audience can understand the \"point.\" I don't know if I got the purpose of the film. \n\nI see some analogy to parenthood, and raising a child before releasing them into the great unknown of the world and seeing what marvelous things they can do. But...there were way too many things not explained. \n\nWhy could he not go into the sun until he exploded in the sunrise? What the hell did Adam Driver figure out by looking at the numbers on the whiteboard? Are the alien being made out of electromagnetic waves? Is that why he can read satellite signals? **Why did he have to go to those specific coordinates in order to do his thing?** Aren't these aliens everywhere? How did he get his powers in the first place? \n\nI feel as though the payoff at the end could have been so much better if we knew just, like, one or two more things about his powers and his situation. \n\nI simply don't know what I'm supposed to walk away from this movie with.

There were some scenes that started off very intriguing and suspenseful, but the suspense always tapered off in an unsatisfying way. For example, near the end of the movie, the characters spent a lot of time preparing for entering the guarded area, so I assumed that some serious shit was gonna go down. But instead they just drove through a small barricade, and... that's it. Mission accomplished. Pretty weak. A lot of the scenes were like this.\n\nAlso, the characters weren't developed well. I felt like I was watching a movie that had its first act taken out. I didn't get the characters at all. Did I miss something? Nobody in the movie had any character traits. I felt distanced.

I love to think about movies and make my conclusions as the story goes along so for me this is a great movie. \n\nThe ending was a nice conclusion to the mystery. I know some people will say \"but they didn't explain his powers or who they were... Etc.\" it doesn't matter. It's a child who doesn't really understand what it is himself. He was told he was the savior then the government tells him he is a weapon. He figures it out at some point when he goes into the sun. Does he sit and explain all of it to the audience? No. That is the point of it being a true mystery movie. Sometimes you just gotta sit back and enjoy the mystery for what it is rather than try and break it apart into pieces.

It has a few flaws, and knowing that going in will probably improve your experience overall.\n\nI thought the first hour was good, great in parts, and I liked the slow build, the sudden moments of dissonance and awe, such as the kids eye-power with their safe house guy, and the satellite falling to earth, but then the mystery begins to drag a little too much, and you realize it isn't going to resolve well. \n\nI thought the government investigation was mostly great, Adam Driver really stood out, and I liked that the cult weren't actually crazy or terrible, just... odd. But again, it petered out a little bit, and stayed mysterious too long, for no reason.\n\nKirsten Dunst got a really raw deal. I can see why her character was necessary, for the aims of the film, but it didn't deliver on those aims enough, didn't give her anything interesting to do, and it really split the dynamic of the two men. I also think it robbed Shannon, and his character, of a better ending. Had he been there at the end, instead of her, and it just been Edgerton in the car, it might have had more impact. \n\nAs to the end, the final sequence just felt flat, somehow. Again, had it been packer, and just the two men, it might have been better, or more tense. I don't know. The very end, I was actually fine with. It's no different to the end of Close Encounters, it just needed a more suspenseful action build up. Ultimately, the film promised one thing, but was really looking at something else, and that's what hurts the audience.\n\nThe visuals and music were uniformly great, and I'm glad I saw it.

I also like how Alton doesn't understand what he is at first while those where he came from know he is in the wrong place and are trying to get him back. Could it be a future Earth with an evolved race of beings? The architecture of the structures was familiar, were covered in foliage and had sails for what I assumed to be like wind turbines. Also the figures were all humanoid shape. Just some thoughts. The lack of explanation highlights the lack of understanding the human characters were capable of. I don't know of any movie that's executed the idea of a parallel universe like this, really clever. Great movie.

Since Take Shelter, Michael Shannon has been my favourite actor, crushing ever role big or small that he takes. Jeff Nichols also blew me away, and whilst I've still not seen Shotgun Stories, Mud continued to prove that he's one of the best new directors working today along with Ben Wheatley (although I've still not seen High Rise). I also love Adam Driver who I recognised as something special from his first season in Girls and have been so happy to see the rise in his career. I also am a huge Dunst fan, and off the back of Fargo Season 2 love her even more. Joel Edgerton didn't really blow me away in anything before this, but I thought he was great in it as well.\n\nFrom the opening scene with the night vision goggles and the dimming of the headlines, I could tell I was in for special. This film had equal shades No Country for Old men as it did Close Encounters. The scene when they leave the hotel room only to be shot at by the pair from the church was amazingly tense, and the car \"chase\" was such an innovative way of building that tension. Not showing the deaths of the church pair and the taking of Alton really felt like something straight out of No Country for Old Men.\n\nThe ending was surprisingly beautiful. The new world overlapping with the south was awe-inspiring, and opened up so many questions. Roy's decision not to take Alton himself confused me, and still does. This had largely been their journey and yet Dunst's character ultimately took him the final stretch.\n\nI didn't spot the glow in Roy's eyes at the end like some people here are saying, and I was actively looking for exactly that, but either way I personally love the questions left unanswered at the end. I hope this film does well, because whilst it definitely doesn't need a sequel, and I wouldn't really want one in anyway - if Hollywood is becoming all about world-building to set up franchises, Jeff Nichols just showed them how the fuck its done.\n\nOverall this film really resonated with me in a way I wasn't expecting. I'll be thinking about it for days and recommending it to everyone I know - it's going to be hugely divisive, but if you go in blind you will surely be in for a tense thrill ride with cast of pure powerhouse performances.", "I loved it up to the scene in the motel after Alton shows his dad the \"other world.\" The movie builds up this wonderful mystery and tension that is immediately subverted by the second half after that scene. \n\nIt shows too much to be subtle Sci fi but not enough to have any resolution.\n\nSeriously there is no resolution. The ranch cult is forgotten, the alien world that's supposed to be this big reveal is completely illogical and presented like any other cliched Sci fi (think montage people across the world with looks of wonder on their faces), the mother simply dissapears without any story to begin with, and the father has an even more ambiguous ending.\n\nThe mysterious powers of Alton are built up in pieces as if the screenwriter thought of them as he went along.\n\nIt just felt like a waste of time.\n", "Do you guys think that the flash of light in Shannon's eyes in the last shot meant he was one of the light people too?\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed it.

Punk Jimmy was great. Coke Jimmy was awesome/hilarious.

Yes, the entire film is in first-person. Like these FPS games from way back (Duke Nukem, Doom, etc.), it\u2019s a really simple story. It IS idiotic, but that\u2019s kind of the point. It\u2019s a super tight 90 minutes. No frills to it. The plot is gradually given out at a nice pace, and it\u2019s more really focused on the action. It\u2019s like watching a 90-min long, really cool GIF. The action is crazy good. **Some parts are kind of nuts. I would not recommend this to people who are squeamish. It is crazy, CRAZY violent.** Almost everybody who worked on this film was Russian, and it really shows. Behavior, lingo, mannerisms, quips- Russian culture 100%. This actually helps the film be even more unique. For what it is- a homage to these older games and a completely 1st-Person film- It doesn\u2019t even try to be more than that and it works. In an alternate universe, this would be an action film that would focus on disability culture. Disability is a continuing theme in the movie, but \u2026 It\u2019s more about the action, seriously.

It\u2019s violent, crass and bizarre. **But, it\u2019s different.**\n\nRecommendation: Go see it.", "Whatever impression you got from the trailer is probably going to be how you feel about this movie. Personally I loved it, it's crazy, fast, interesting, and fun. I did the fathom event and the AMA here on reddit was a lot better, but it was fun seeing Sharlto being giddy. Also my theater was really weird about the complimentary prequel comic. I went up to the desk before the movie to ask about it and they were telling people that corporate was telling them not to hand them out because they were graphic (not really btw), then I went back up to the desk after and somebody gave me one. I think I was the only person who actually got it because everyone left out before me and they had to unwrap the comic from a stack for me, which sucks because people paid a little extra for a reason. I dunno the whole comic situation was just weird, but it's a neat little comic that gives the villain's backstory.\n\n**Spoiler time!**\n\n**Things I liked**: The action, ninja twins, all the Jimmys, the music, Henry's comedic gestures, and Akan all the Akan!!! Seriously that guy could be a damn Far Cry villain with how crazy and charismatic he is.\n\n**Things I did not like**: Haley Bennett, I wanted to like her but really she is kind of the weakest link here in terms of acting. Also totally did not trust her the minute she refused to step in the escape pod. Only other thing that kept kind of taking me out of the moment was Akan never looking at Henry when he was talking to him. Everyone else looks at Henry, but Akan is almost always looking off to our left when he is being seen in person.

Because if they had, people like me, the ones who are motion sensitive, would have never been able to get invested in the plot because we'd be too busy having our faces in the garbage pails being reminded of what we had for lunch. Also, I was so glad that it was only 90 minutes or so. \n\nI understood that the point of view of the film meant that I was going to have an increased chance of queasiness from the shaky cam. So I thought it wise to pop a few dramamine before the movie, sit in the back row, carry an emergency barf bag, and just ride it out, but little did I know that it takes a bit for the dramamine to kick in. \n\nThe action scenes actually weren't that bad for my stomach. It was the rest of the movie that was making me sick. All the parkour, running, sudden whooshes to the sides, and the random head bobs that felt completely unnecessary during the slower scenes that were making me approach ralphing territory. \n\nThe final fight scene was actually the least upchuck inducing scene of the entire movie. Maybe that's when the dramamine finally kicked in or if there's some actual steadiness in the camera, but as soon as Queen's Don't Stop Me Now kicked in, I knew I was going to survive. \n\nThe plot is C Level. Guy wakes up from life threatening injuries, is revived by wife, telekinetic villain shows up, fucks shit up, steals wife, and makes our hero go on a rather large bout of revenge as well as being tasked with stopping the villian's scheme of building an army of badass cyborgs. Of course in this case, a bit of sci-fi is tossed in with the cybernetic body that is our protagonist and the inclusion of Jimmy and his Life Model Decoys. \n\nJimmy was probably the best part of the whole flick, though his \"I Got You,\" bit was a bit corny. I particularly liked the WWII Colonel Jimmy. He added some humor to one of the big action scenes toward the end. \n\nI think I'll give it 2.5/5 stars for those that can handle the shakiness of the First Person perspective, and 2 stars for those that can't. \n\nIs it worth seeing in theaters? That's hard to say. It's actually one of the few movies I've been to that I could actually notice the 5.1 Surround Sound channels working wonderfully, but you could replicate this at home and not have to worry about tossing your cookies or whatever you ate before attending the movie in someone else's bin\n\nSo if you're concerned about doing the technicolor yawn, ([thank you Thesaurus.com](http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/barf)), for this movie be wary. \n", "I felt claustrophobic. What separates movies from video games is the sense of agency games give the player, and while Hardcore Henry emulates a lot of video game conventions, it can't replicate that, so a lot of time I just felt trapped in someone else's body. I don't know if that's a knock against the movie, necessarily, but it did hamper my own enjoyment. ", "I didn't expect to be in the minority on this one. Granted, my tolerance for dumb has been tempered like fucking steel over the years. I'm gonna go against the grain and say that not only is a 48/100 insanely off base, but I feel like a few of the negative reviews say more about their authors than the film itself, but I'll get to that.\n\n\nStory's dumb. I don't care, but I know a lot of people would. But I imagine people who would care wouldn't see the trailer and decide it was worth checking out. But I did like the setup of the story and the world it built. It's barebones in its actual descriptions of the world but I feel like what we learned through visuals was really cool and I'd like to see it explored more. I missed the chance to see the Ultimate Fan Experience version tonight due to work and apparently that comes with a comic book so maybe that fleshes things out a little more. Either way, being dropped into a world with no info and learning along with Henry was great fun to me.\n\n\nThe concepts were very interesting if not a bit outdated, but they're handled in a cool, slick way. Same with the action. Other than the parkour there wasn't much to the action that hadn't been done before, but it was done so well and in such a cool way that it simply never stopped being entertaining to me. I've seen a lot of critique of Henry as a character, but despite being silent, I really liked him. The way he moved, the reactions he had, and the skills he showed off managed to grow him as a character without a vocal or facial performance and that's cool.\n\n\nSharlto Copley killed it. Like, he couldn't have been better. The concept of his character was cool, and that concept lead to some really fun scenes and interesting gags. The musical number in his lab, his role as the hobo on the bus, and the British soldier persona were easily highlights of the movie for me. Loved him.\n\n\nThe villain was awesome, too. I don't know his back story, and that sucks because he seems he'd have a cool background. But I feel like he doesn't suffer for that. He's silly, intimidating, and entertaining to watch. Estelle could've been better but her role in the greater plot was really cool if not a little too telegraphed. But it's still an interesting take on a tired trope that's handled well enough.\n\n\nThe action was amazing. It's not the first first person movie, it's not the first first person action movie, and some CGI stuff looks a bit rough. But despite it's flaws, it manages to do really, really cool stuff and you get to see these things from a cool perspective. It's like an inverse of The Raid to me and I honestly think it's one of the coolest action movies SINCE The Raid. I really liked the setups for some of these scenes, most notably the sniping section in the hotel with Jimmy swapping bodies to get into different positions during the fight. That's such a neat idea. I was surprised by how well the humor worked, too. The horse scenes was hilarious.\n\n\nWhat I meant with the reviews earlier... I don't wanna seem rude to a lot of reviewers, but from a handful of the negative reviews I've read, a lot of the complaints feel like complaints the reviewers went into wanting to make. I've seen at least three reviews complaining about how masculine it is or a lack of female involvement. The dominatrixes (dominatrices?) had some really cool scenes in the brothel and it was nice to see an outright villain as a woman for once, not something you see often in action movies. It IS stupidly macho. Why is this a problem, though, fundamentally? Commando is outrageously macho, Predator is glossy with a thin veneer of testosterone, the martial arts genre built itself upon well oiled shirtless dudes punching the shit out of each other. That's the genre. That's just such a vapid complaint to me. I understand not liking it, sure, no accounting for taste, but going into a gory action movie with the mindset of \"overly masculine action is stupid,\" then why even bother watching it in the first place? I dunno, that's just my two cents on it, fantastic movie, honestly surprised by its reception so far.", "Definitely not for everyone, but I *really* liked it. My biggest complaint is that some of the dialogue was hard to understand. The worst offenders were subtitled, though.", "Man was this movie a blast! I felt like I played a video game. Corny and violence and action from start to finish. \n\n\"I dodged a bullet there.\" I laughed pretty hard at that line.", "[removed]", "Just got out of the Drafthouse. I can see why some critics would not like this movie. Personally, I thought it was fun and it felt like I was watching someone playing a video game. In fact, there were so many gaming tropes touched upon it felt like a love letter to video game fans, especially those who enjoy first person shooters, sci fi or survival horror (to an extent) genres. You have this Ship of Theseus type character who has no clue what's going on, a character who keeps \"respawning\" and representing different supporting characters you would find in these games, the cell phone Jimmy kept messaging you on, the grenade and medical boxes, the telekinetic villain... I just wish I could have played it AND watched it. I also thought the scenes that were straight up first person shooter were executed better than the melee combat scenes.\n\nThe strip club scene was very surreal, and reminded me of Hotline Miami. It was my favorite part and coked out Jimmy was great. I actually wish the movie hadn't explained Jimmy so much and kept him as this \"wtf?\" kind of personality egging you on. But, that's personal preference.\n\nI laughed pretty hard at the horse fail scene. Sorry Henry, but you aren't Link from Zelda.", "I felt a little disappointed somehow (probably the twist) but I had an awesome time. Sharlto Copley KILLED it. ", "[deleted]", "Saw it at SXSW. Sat in the front row, which was the best because the screen took up my entire field of vision and almost felt like playing a video game.\n\nI liked it... sort of. Not enough that I would ever want to pay for the experience again. It's kind of like the feeling you get after riding a ride in an amusement park- fun at the time, but not much else to it after it ends. You may leave the ride and say \"maybe I'll go on again,\" but more than likely you'll run to one of the other hundreds of rides and get on those instead.\n\nIt was my kind of humor and I was very impressed with the stunts and gratuitous violence presentation (though, many people in my audience were quite squeamish about it). However, it really was just \"Joke 1, Stunt 1, Dialogue. Joke 2, Stunt 2, Dialogue. Joke 3, Stunt 3, Dialogue.\" Not so much like an action movie is presented, but more or less EXACTLY how a video game's story is progressed (cutscene, player takes control, cutscene). The problem being, of course, is that story progression works in video games because you ARE a part of the story- not simply watching it through the eyes of the main character.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I experienced it once, but once is enough. If I want to watch a \"Let's Play,\" I'll stick to YouTube/Twitch- it's a hell of a lot cheaper. Also, I'll be able to get some laundry done.", "Sharlto Copley plays some of the most memorable characters with the best one-liners. The part where we was in the ghillie suit and he says, \"IT'S ME.\" basically killed me. This movie knows what it is, and has fun with it. Things like, \"You are half machine, half pussy\" and \"Akan is a cunt!\" were just fantastic. ", "I guess I'll dissent and just say I didn't have fun. Maybe it's the video quality of Go Pro or the kind of action they had but it felt like a boring Crank film. It also didn't help that the comedy fell completely flat. My audience laughed more at a shitty trailer before the film than the entire film itself. I'm down for another crack at this kind of film but it needs to be in a better director's hand. This just felt too low rent and dull.", "I really enjoyed it. It's not quite Fury Road but it's on par with John Wick and Dredd. Definitely a fun ride and up there as one of the finest modern action flicks. It's mindless but as much fun as something like this could be. Sharlto Copely was just awesome. The first person doesn't get old or repetitive and you will care about the characters more and more as what little plot there is drives forward. Some genuinely laugh out loud moments, holy shit kills/moves, and a great conclusion. ", "Sadly, I didn't remotely like this movie, despite REALLY wanting to like it coming in. \n\nAs everyone here has said, the movie didn't even try in the story or character department. Henry and Jimmy just run around various locales shooting people with no reasons given for why they're going anywhere. The motorcycle bit was cool and all, but why were they or the bad guys even out on that road? They just end up driving to a forest for no reason. \n\nBut I'm more than willing to forgive dumb plot if the action is good. The Raid had a barebones plot, but who cares, awesome fights. That's where this movie really bummed me out. \n\nIf you've seen the concept trailer that was made during the movie's crowdfunding, you've seen the best action scene in the movie. Everything else is a shaky, poorly shot and edited, incomprehensible mess. There's some really nice stuntwork going on, but its usually obscured by blurry camera work that spins away to the next stunt before you've had a chance to even see what happened, or jump cuts that do nothing but screw up the spatial continuity. \n\nSharlto Copley was really good. So, good for him!", "Just saw it. Have to say the best action movie I have ever seen, the soundtrack alone has been the best of any movie I have ever heard.

Those aren't my real thoughts on the movie, just wanted it for the lulz.\n\nThe movie is complete shit though.\n\nSo this has some plot lines they didn't finish from the first film. Namely the Chinese guy who now found Jesus, making it a big deal, because he is Chinese. His dad came all the way over to America in his business suit still to tell them the fact that he has found Jesus means he is no longer his son and he has disgraced the family. Even though it wasn't affecting grades or his future yet.  AFTER that conversation, he decided to become a pastor, meaning then the conversation would have made sense for the dad to have said everything.\n\nIn the last film a journalist who had the NERVE to be liberal and hate Duck Dynasty people for some stupid reason got cancer by the end. But the Newsboys apparently cured her cancer with prayer we learn at the start of the film. She is in this movie but useless, never really using her journalistic power but just saying shit like follow your heart.\n\nAnyways, the trial was absurd. The problem with it is that the teacher obviously did nothing wrong, but the evil ACLU want to make an example of her and make a precedent for Jesus talk of any form. The ACLU lawyer is Ray Wise, who practically grows a mustache and twirls it while saying this line outside of the trail: \"We're going to prove once and for all that GOD IS DEAD!!\"\n\nI laughed out loud in the theater and was alone unfortunately.\n\nAnyways, shit trial. Like they don't figure out their defense strategy until it is their turn for witnesses, and they are somehow able to get all these scholars from across the country to fly up out of the blue. Pretty sure that stuff should be determined before that. I dunno, I'm not a lawyer.\n\nSpeaking of not being a lawyer, here is how it ends. Sabrina's lawyer isn't a believer (and somehow doesn't convert by the end), but out of options, he decides to dress like the other lawyer, nice black shoes and all, and calls her to the stand. He is able to treat her as hostile of course, because she didn't want to go to the stand, and he fucking just berates her in front of the jury over her beliefs. About how and why she became a Christian and why she won't apologize, causing tears. That is literally his last ditch effort. Be mean to her really really bad, which wouldn't fly in any court room, giving her a sympathy vote. \n\nSo of course she wins. ACLU lawyer won't appeal to avoid a bigger precedent. During the trial we had peaceful Christians protesting outside by sitting in silence while Atheists just yelled at them with signs the whole time. \n\nThe main high school chick had a quick talk with Sabrina after everyone left the court room and she was all \"GO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS!\"\n\nSo that is where we get our cheesy scene of her running out of the court to the front, where literally everyone else already made it, journalist and spectator, but no one said the results. And you know what she said. You damn well know what she said. She yells \"GOD'S NOT DEAD.\"\n\nBig victory. Everyone party. Very hypocritical, when nothing she said was preaching anyways, just talking about things in a historical context to answer one question. If they were right, then it wasn't about god being \"dead or not\", just historical Jesus. So, the fact that everyone is celebrating as if they can now preach in the classroom is completely fucked up and ruins the whole damn point.

In an absurd world, how can one find meaning without God? Why can't the star of such beloved 90s classics as Clarissa Explains It All and Sabrina the Teenage Witch find more success in her career? Can one continue to express their faith freely as they once could when society is moving away from religion?

I really liked the suit and that he matched up with Superman in size. Not a huge fan of the bigger metal suit but it was ok.  \n\n* Gadot was good as Wonder Woman and I loved her joining the fight along with her theme playing. Definitely my favorite piece of music in an overall really enjoyable score. I'm glad there wasn't too much focus on her because I think that would have taken away from Batmans introduction. Really hopeful for her solo movie though!  \n\n* There were some really beautiful scenes and the fights were pretty cool. I especially enjoyed various shots of Superman floating with his cape fluttering in the wind and the shot of Batman watching them load the Kryptonite onto the truck.   \n\n* They really showed off the power difference between Batman vs Wonder Woman and Superman in the final fight with Doomsday. Batman had to jump out the way and stay around the edge to not die whilst WW and S went straight at Doom.\n\n\n**The Bad**  \n\n* The editing and pacing was really weird and hard to follow. It cut between different scenes, characters, locations very rapidly and it just felt off the entire way through.   \n\n* Having both Batmans introduction and the buildup of his resentment of Superman in one movie was too much. Should have had a separate Batman movie first that could have included some buildup and raised the stakes. For example I'm a lot more invested in the Captain America vs. Iron Man conflict because I know and care about those characters already.  \n\n* Batman and Superman went from fighting to the death to being buddies WAY too quickly. Also Batman goes from about to kill Superman to working together in an instant simply because their mothers have the same name. It felt like way too thin of a thread to make a complete 180 turn. Also at the funeral Batman is talking about failing Superman as if they've been friends all their lives.  \n\n* I didn't like Eisenberg as Lex Luthor at all. His performance felt way too overacted and like he really wanted to be the Joker. He never felt like a real character, instead all I saw was Eisenberg acting goofy.   \n\n* Lois Lane had no place in the second half of the movie. She was also constantly just a damsel in distress who needed to be saved by Superman, she could never do anything on her own. Disappointing when we got such a badass character in Wonder Woman.  \n\n* I'm don't know very much about the comics but from what I've read Doomsday is a major antagonist to Superman. The way he was created and introduced felt so rushed and generic that it might as well have been left out of the movie.  \n\n**Nitpicks**  \n\n* Too many shots of Bruce walking in slow motion through the fields around his parents house.   \n\n* At the beginning when Metropolis was getting destroyed the Wayne Enterprises employees decided to stay in the skyscraper right in the middle of it until Bruce showed up and told them to leave. Why the fuck had they not run out of there as soon as shit started blowing up!!??   \n\n* Doomsday looked very similar to the mountain troll from Fellowship of the Ring that stabs Frodo. I'm not sure if that's what he's suppose to look like but it felt like a generic render selected from a database of monster characters.   \n\n* Giving Lois the ring after he died kind of felt like a real dick move. Obviously we know he's coming back but in reality Lois would be moving on at some point in the future and getting an engagement ring right after your boyfriend just died feels like a slap in the face and a way to force her to stay \"faithful\" even though he's dead.", "This is all I could think about on my drive home. http://i.imgur.com/nc2eNaq.png", "The trailer ruined it all.  \n\nReally.

I'm going to explain the \"dreams\" out of order because it's much easier to explain that way.\n\n\n**The Desert batman:**\nBefore I can explain any of the dreams I have to explain Darkseid. [Darkseid](http://i.imgur.com/OHIXJfV.jpg) is basically space god Hitler/Mussolini, his entire goal is to subjugate everything in existence to his will. His method for this is something called the anti-life equation, a mathematical proof that proves that subjugation to Darkseid is the truth of the universe. When the desert batman looks out he sees a burning omega on the ground, this is Darkseid's symbol. What Batman is seeing is an alternate universe or future timeline where Darkseid has won. Superman is under Darkseid's control, this is why he is evil and after batman in this future. \n\n\n**The Flash:**\n After Bruce Wayne \"wakes up\" from this dream the flash appears to him in a worm hole to warn him about a future event. Unfortunately the flash went to far back in time and Bruce has no clue who he is or why he is there. While the flash does have limited time travel powers when he is using the cosmic treadmill, this isn't the case here. This appearance is a reference to [crisis on infinite earths](http://i.imgur.com/MIL28SO.jpg) where the [flash sacrifices himself](http://i.imgur.com/rqInMtx.jpg) to save the universe from the biggest dc baddies in the entire multiverse, the anti monitor.\n\n\n**The Demon/Giant Bat:**\n Now you might be asking yourself, why is batman jumping through time or able to see the future? There is an explanation. Darkseid in reality is [not a physical being He's a living idea.](http://i.imgur.com/pNfSmQN.jpg) Batman must [betray his two cardinal rules in order to defeat Darkseid](http://i.imgur.com/GrSvEqR.jpg).

Clark Kent died too. \n\nI really couldn't help but roll my eyes at that part. ", "[deleted]", "The first thing I really noticed about this is that the editing/pacing of the movie is a mess. Every scene just kind of smashes into the next one. No build up, no setting the scene, nothing. Just cuts right to another character doing something in a completely different location, sometimes a flashback or a dream sequence. It's very jarring. \n\nThe other thing was the dialogue. With a few exceptions (Alfred, Perry) most of the characters have nothing but hamfisted dialogue. None of them really feel \"real\". They just feel like movie characters saying lines only movie characters would say, all dramatic and important like. They didn't sell me that they were real people facing real problems.\n\nThere's also the abysmal way they shoehorned in the Justice League setup. I've seen people make fun of Marvel movies for setting up the next film, and it's sometimes very well deserved (pool scene in Age of Ultron is the worst offender) but I think BvS is worse than them all. They have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, Batman just finds info on them all for no real reason, opens a file (each one MARKED WITH A LOGO FOR EACH CHARACTER - they might as well be posters saying \"COMING 2017\"!) and we get a totally unrelated sneak peek at them all. It feels incredibly rushed and amateur. \n\nI felt Jessie Eisenberg was a miscast. He comes off more of a complete loon than a suave, calculating Lex. He almost seems like Joker-lite. Just doing crazy things to create chaos. I was also confused as to why Amy Adams was even in this movie. It seemed like they struggled to find reasons to keep her around. The desert scene made sense since she was bait, and finding the connection to LexCorp, sure. But after that she just keeps popping up for no real reason.\n\nOverall I was pretty disappointed with this. I wanted it to be good, I really did. It seemed like it was addressing the criticism of Man of Steel and its destruction, etc. but that doesn't really amount to anything. There's still too much destruction. Superman is still mopey and actually pretty much a bully in this. \n\nThis film should have been so much better.", "I find it funny how Lex made individual logos for all the superheroes he discovered. \nIt must of been like, \"and aquaman, you get a cool looking a!\"", "Not sure if others noticed but there was a star wars reference at the end lex luthors prisoner number is tk-421.", "There's so much to say about this movie. I have so many feelings towards it, both good and bad. I'll try to keep it brief. Heads up, though, because spoilers abound...\n\n**The Good:**\n\n* Batman was fucking badass. Best Batman we've seen in a movie thus far.\n\n* The fight choreography was stellar (Holy shit, that scene where Batman saved Martha...whew!).\n\n* When Wonder Woman finally went into action, it was awesome. I liked her much more than I thought I would. Probably even more than Superman.\n\n* As with all of Zack Snyder's movies, the cinematography was gorgeous.\n\n* The sound design was glorious. You felt every punch, every gun shot, every explosion -- all of it. It really amped up the action.\n\n* *Most* of the score was fantastic. Wonder Woman's theme was kick-ass.\n\n**The Bad:**\n\n* Holy shit, talk about a crowded movie. There were seven -- yes, *seven* -- separate storylines going on at once, and they didn't do a very good job of making them flow together well.\n\n* None of the characters felt fleshed out, like, at all. And that's due mostly to the fact that they just didn't have time to flesh them out in this crammed-as-fuck movie.\n\n* Superman dying was just stupid. This is only his second movie, and he shared it with Batman. Again, his character wasn't very fleshed out in this movie and had almost no arc. So his death didn't feel like it was earned. Besides, you know he's not staying dead. It was just pointless. Superman's death should have been saved for the Justice League.\n\n* 25% of this movie felt like it was there to set up Justice League and the DC Cinematic Universe. Which is fine. I understand they want to catch up to Marvel. But don't make it feel so forced and out of place. It wasn't done naturally at all.\n\n* Not enough of Batman/Bruce fighting -- either physically or mentally -- Kal-El.\n\n* Like I said, *most* of the score was fantastic. Lex Luthor's theme was just weird, and didn't fit the movie whatsoever.\n\n**The Rest:**\n\n* Jesse Eisenberg was fine as Lex. He portrayed the character as best as anyone could. I just didn't like this particular incarnation of the character. He didn't feel menacing or threatening. He felt more like a psychotic child on the loose. I understand what they were going for, it just didn't work for me.\n\n* The scene with the rest of the Justice League was the definition of forced. It was cool to see them, but so unnecessary.\n\n* The Doomsday plot line was clearly tagged on as a way to bring Batman and Superman together. It was a great climax, but it felt like extra, after the incredible fight between Batman and Superman.\n\n* At the end of the fight, all of a sudden Bruce and Clark are friends? Because Clark's mother is in danger? I understand Bruce has sympathy for Clark, but it was like \"I HATE YOU YOU NEED TO BE RID OF THIS WORLD!\" ... \"But my mom's in trouble!\" ... \"Oh. I'll save her! Friends?\" It happened too quickly and unnaturally.\n\nOverall, the movie was more Dawn of Justice than Batman V. Superman. Bruce Wayne's story was about finding out what Lex is up to, and Superman's story is about being accepted as a hero rather than a threat. Then off to the side is their gripes with each other.\n\nThe vibe I got from this movie was that Snyder has always wanted to direct a Batman movie, and finally got the chance to, but had to put all of the other stuff in there, too.", "This film would have been much better as two or three movies instead of one. You could have: \n\nA Man of Steel sequel that introduces Lex, actually develops some concrete reasoning behind why he hates Superman, give Henry Cavill a whole films worth of screentime to work with and get us to root for his character. They could actually deliver on the promise the senate hearing showed as well, like a lot of the stuff in this film it was a good idea executed poorly.\n\nA Batman solo film to reintroduce the character, explore why he's become more brutal, explore Alfred, maybe introduce Wonder Woman. Maybe even end with the scene of Bruce seeing the destruction in Metropolis from the ground level.\n\nThen have Batman v Superman, now there's history between Lex and Superman, Supes is more developed so the 'Death of Superman' arc has more weight, there's more room to breathe in the movie and fit justice league foreshadowing in.\n\nI honestly wouldn't be surprised if they originally planned it this way and then panicked and shmushed everything together get to a big 'event' movie in the universe after the lukewarm reception for Man of Steel.

The scene where Batman doesnt kill Supes because of Martha....couldve been done right if they had built it correctly.  But, I just couldnt buy it.  Plus Lois showing up just in time.  I dont mind just in time moments in movies, but sometimes they can be to auspicious.\n\n3.  The existence of Doomsday in the first movie.  This felt like a rushed mistake.  Lex can manipulate (in what seems like days) Kryptonian technology to maliciously modify a Kryptonian with human DNA?

Same with Eisenberg, too. He pulls off the creepy genius extremely well. Cavill won't convince naysayers that Superman is a good character, though.\n\nI will say Hans Zimmer's soundtrack knocks it out of the park, though. The song that plays once Wonder Woman is in costume is stellar.", "EDIT: I've been reminded of how Clark heard the earpiece, slipped my mind when I wrote this. And I saw the movie on Monday, if you're wondering.\n\nI think the reviews are kind of justified, personally. I enjoyed the movie somewhat, but Christ it was a mess. The more I\u2019ve thought on it, the worse my opinion has gotten.\n\nBatman's arc worked fine for me, and I liked Affleck's portrayal. People get all hung up on him killing people, but I've never gotten too caught up in that. The whole \u201cnot killing\u201d aspect of Batman\u2019s character gets brought up too often, and it\u2019s nice that we didn\u2019t spend time having to see Bruce tackle the same exact problem he faced already in both *Batman Begins* and *The Dark Knight*. \n\nAs expected, Superman isn\u2019t given much to do. Henry Cavill is wasted in the role, since they don\u2019t expand much on how he was written in *Man of Steel*. Snyder\u2019s whole conception of the character is backwards to me, since a big part of what makes Superman interesting is how he\u2019s relatable to normal people.  Sure, he has extraordinary powers, but at the end of the day Clark Kent lives his life as an average man with a job, a wife, and friends from work. \n\nHe\u2019s also too dour here, spending the entirety of the runtime brooding or smirking condescendingly at humans. Honestly, they should be looking at stories like /u/uptomyknees\u2019 *American Alien*, the whole point of which is to depict Superman as a normal guy who struggles and goes through life like the rest of us, yet also has a lighter, cheerier side. (By the way, awesome job on AA, Max Landis!)\n\nAmy Adams is also good as Lois Lane, though her whole story arc about going back to get the spear felt pretty contrived. Jeremy Irons was a great Alfred, and the repertoire between him and Affleck\u2019s Bruce was one of the highlights of the film. Lawrence Fishburne was so great as Perry White, he had some of the best lines of the film. The shame is that all of these supporting characters don\u2019t get much to do, and you\u2019re left pining for them to come back and add some color to the film during the more action-heavy sections.\n\nI liked Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and her part wasn\u2019t too overbearing on the film. The two scenes she has with Bruce Wayne have a fun spy-movie vibe to them, and the mystery surrounding the photograph from World War I was enough to whet my appetite for her solo film without becoming overbearing to the rest of the story. They also gave Diana some personality during her part of the fight scene, having her smirk and seem to be a natural warrior, as opposed to super-stoic. \n\nI\u2019m perplexed by the scene where the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg are introduced to us in rapid succession. It all feels so forced in, and stops the film dead at a point when we\u2019re supposed to be racing for the finish line. Flash and Aquaman\u2019s vignettes were cool to see, nice little teasers for their respective characters; the Cyborg scene, meanwhile, was rough, and looked like a YouTube short film. Not to mention the fact that we can barely see Cyborg at all in that scene. \n\nMaybe they should\u2019ve avoided the *Justice League* aspects altogether, since they add nothing to the main storyline. Even the scene with the Flash at the beginning, when he came through the portal, was pretty pointless. The sound was mixed so that you couldn\u2019t hear a word Ezra Miller was saying, and his warning has no bearing on the rest of the story. Sure, it\u2019s to set-up *Justice League*, but that\u2019s not a good enough excuse.\n\nLex Luthor was an interesting character, since Jesse Eisenberg did his own thing with the part. Luthor of the comics is more of a cunning shark businessman (think Patrick Bateman with Trump\u2019s empire and a knack for mad science), whereas here they play him as more of a tech mogul. I think the best way to describe Eisenberg\u2019s performance is, \u201cMark Zuckerberg meets stereotypical Southern faith-healer meets cold, unsettling sociopath,\u201d and it worked for me for the most part. \n\nOne aspect I really liked was that he kept invading other characters\u2019 personal space and touching them. The Jolly Rancher bit and stroking Superman\u2019s face in particular creeped me out. However, that final scene in the prison, where he talks about Darkseid and \u201cringing a bell, dingdingdingding!\u201d was dumb, and took the air out of the end of the film.\n\nBut now, onto the shakier parts of the film. There are so many unanswered questions:\n\n* **Why does Lex Luthor hate Superman?** - There\u2019s no clear reason given, besides something to do with his father. He refers to Superman as God a lot, and describes the events of the film in Biblical terms, but that doesn\u2019t cover it, in my book. Superman and Luthor\u2019s rivalry should\u2019ve been the main focus of the film (Batman stuff aside), as opposed to one sequence before the final fight begins.\n\n* **Why does Lex Luthor create Doomsday?** - Not only will the thing be traceable to him, since it\u2019s made USING HIS DNA, but it seems like there\u2019s no way to control it if things get out-of-hand. If they had implied he was aiming for something more humanoid like Bizarro, and it came out like Doomsday, it\u2019d make more sense.\n\n* **How does Lex Luthor know who Darkseid is? Did he talk to him?** - Lex is apparently shown 100,000 races from across the galaxy (in record time, since it seems like that\u2019s only a day or two before the fight kicks off), but we never get a clear hint at Darkseid before the end of the movie. It\u2019s somewhat implied that they spoke, since Luthor speaks about him familiarly in the jail cell. I would suspect that this is to going to lead to the set-up of Luthor as Darkseid\u2019s lackey/guide to humanity (much like Hackman\u2019s Luthor in Superman II), which would be kind of lame, not to mention a rehash of the older Superman movies.\n\nEach of these questions could\u2019ve been answered in a few minutes, but that would\u2019ve tacked on even more time onto this movie\u2019s bloated runtime anyways. The focus is being pulled in so many different directions, it can never stay on one person for too long!\n\nThe fact that the two leads fought so late into the movie, without having any relationship between them, is really strange to me. It's the focus of the marketing, yet it doesn't happen until about an hour and a half in. It goes on for about 10-15 minutes, gets kinda dumb at points. Batman actually smashes a fucking SINK over Superman's head at one point, Jesus Christ.\n\nOne of the weirdest parts is that right before they face off, Clark calls Batman \"Bruce,\" and it isn't justified. We never see Clark learn Batman's identity, and they have NO friendship at all. They could've alleviated this by doing something like in *The Dark Knight Returns*, where Clark goes to Bruce and tries to talk him out of it. But instead, he calls him \"Bruce\" because that's how Superman talks in DKR, and Zack Snyder loves him some DKR.\n\nIn DKR, this fight worked because neither of them really wanted to be there, and it was sad seeing two old friends forced into a fight to the death. In the movie, it's overlong and has no stakes. We know they're gonna work things out, and team-up to stop Doomsday. \n\nAnd plus, Superman has his mother\u2019s IMPENDING DEATH hanging over his head the entire time, but he just seems to forget about it so we can get our slugfest. (If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.) His whole approach to the fight was also weird. Why wouldn't Clark try to get the armor off Bruce, as opposed to trading punches? Rip off those giant gloves, and suddenly Batman can't hit you anymore! Take off his helmet, and his head's also unprotected.\n\nOr why not just make peace? He tries to stop the fight once, for about two seconds, before just giving in to the madness. It seemed like he was angry about nothing in particular, since up to that point he's had no beef with Batman. He doesn't like Bruce's methods, sure, but Clark has no personal grudge with him. Snyder's in such a rush to get to the fight, he doesn't take the time to give it much weight or substance. It's similar to how overblown the alleyway fight in Watchmen got. He misses the point in both instances, but at least the one in Watchmen is only 3 minutes or so.\n\nThe worst logic leap by far was that Lex Luthor seemed to know certain things purely for plot convenience, and because the movie's racing to the fight. When did he figure out Clark Kent was Superman, or that Bruce Wayne was Batman? It\u2019d have been more interesting if Lex had deduced their identities through conjecture, but had no evidence to back it up. And then, his plans rested upon whether or not he was smart enough to figure it all out. That\u2019d be preferable to lazy, lazy storytelling.\n\nThe final fight with Doomsday was nothing special, just another CGI-fest. However, using Doomsday at all and recreating the Death of Superman so soon, in the second film of the franchise, is a waste! Clark hasn\u2019t been Superman long enough for it to have much weight, and the funeral at the end didn\u2019t make sense considering everyone was hateful and afraid of Superman only a few days prior. It doesn\u2019t help that Snyder\u2019s version of Clark doesn\u2019t seem like he endeared himself to the public that much.\n\nHonestly, a lot of these problems could\u2019ve been alleviated by cutting down the story. So much is happening, we never get a chance to catch our breaths and get to know the characters more, or even think about what\u2019s just happened. I\u2019d like to see more Clark & Lois, more Bruce and Alfred, and more Diana, but NOT ALL AT ONCE! Not to mention the menagerie of secondary characters, who, as I said earlier, get shortchanged by their collective amount of screen-time. \n\n**TL;DR** - *Batman v. Superman* was a mixed bag. Some parts I liked, mainly the performances and dialogue, but a lot of the basic story beats made little to no sense. Its characters make bizarre choices, and a lot of it is a jumbled mess that puts style over substance. Hopefully, Zack Snyder can get his shit together for *Justice League: Part 1*, or else the DCEU will definitely be sunk.", "My short opinion: I liked this movie, as i liked Man of Steel.  \n  \nMan of Steel has the better villain, this one has the better heroes.  \n  \nEdit: Can i add how fantastic that opening scene in metropolis was?

Thought there were a lot of corny scenes and sometimes poor dialogue... but overall, good.  \n\nBut can we talk about the elephant in the room? **Batman clearly fucking killed people. A lot of people.** I thought the trailers showing what looked like him killing dudes with the bat wing would somehow turn out not to be the case... but he really did fucking kill people. And the movie never really addressed it at any point... so... what the fuck?\n\nEdit: Also, thought the reveal of Aqua Man was really, really cringey.", "What were Lex Luthor's reasons for wanting to kill Superman? It's a major plot point that's never (clearly) addressed.", "My little brother told me as we drove home that he hated Superman and thought he was a bully.\n\nA Superman film made a child hate Superman. And that, to me, says more about this film's failings than any review or analysis.\n\nWhat a disaster.", "I agree that they tried to tell too many stories and editing suffered because of that. Trailers did reveal a lot but you still had unexpected moments like death of Superman. Overall, I loved it and I think it's an improvement over man of steel. Looking forward to the Justice League.\n\nAlso the opening of the movie was perfect.", "I had low expectations and was still disappointed. \n\n\n\nLex Luthor was ridiculous. How could anyone take him seriously? Complete, unnecessary 180 spin on such a great character. Jesse Eisenberg's performance would have been perfect with someone like Mad Hatter. Definitely not Lex.\n\n\n\n\nBatman killed. A lot. I've read people saying that \"oh it was only a couple\". Not at all. That scene where the turrets on the ground were shooting at him, Batman straight up nuked them! On top of that, the Batmobile literally falls on top of one of them. That guy isn't coming back.\n\n\n\nBatman bringing Doomsday into the city was ridiculous. \n\n\nAmy Adams as Lois Lane makes no sense to me. She didn't add much at all even though she's practically a main character.\n\n\nThe cameos of Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman was pretty cool but at the same time it felt soooo shoehorned. \n\n\nThat entire Darkseid fantasy nightmare scene was a mess. Completely out of nowhere with little to no explanation.\n\n\n\nI actually bought tickets to see this again on Friday with a much larger group of friends. Not looking forward to it.\n\n\n", "The movie is fucking bad. \n\nInstead of acknowledging the vast amount of criticism levied at MoS, they double down on all of it. \n\nThe Christ imagery is even more overt and heavyhanded. \n\nThe editing is, almost inconceivably, worse and more disjointed and incoherent. \n\nThe writing is shallow, the dialogue is bad. There's literally a fucking moment where we're basically shown trailers for the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg movies. \n\nThe climax is a mess of CGI eye candy that devolves into nothingness because it's all eventually just noise. \n\nMost of the characters are either unimportant or incompetent (looking at you, Lois, for throwing the Kryptonite spear into the water because *reason* only to immediately need to dive back in and fish it out again). \n\nBatman fucking kills people. Like, outright. With no explanation as to why that is the case. Why is the goddamn Joker still alive in a universe where Batman is willing to kill? \n\nFor me, the only positives are Affleck (who is now, for my money, the best onscreen Batman), Gadot, and Cavill, who clearly are very invested in the characters. Eisenberg as Luthor was just fucking weird. \n\nI'm just...I was so invested in this movie being good. I ate up every goddamn bit of news for years. I wanted it to be good, and I just feel like I got slapped in the face. This is DC's Amazing Spider-Man 2. This was more concerned with setting up a shared universe than it was with actually fucking answering any of the barely fucking surface-level philosophical questions it sort of attempts to ask. ", "I am not a fan of this film by any stretch, and it's absolutely devastating to have to say that.\n\nI've spent 3 years excited to see this, and unfortunately it didn't even get close to the required standard.\n\nThis to me is exactly why you don't have someone like Zack Snyder take a creative lead on such a huge universe establishing project like this, it's simply not in his nature to tell a story.  Snyder is an advertising director, and that's all he will ever be good for.  He doesn't appreciate the idea of a narrative being compelling, he can't make a batmobile chase tense and exciting by putting stakes on the line, he thinks all things can be solved by simply adding more STUFF happening that looks cool.  \n\nThat's the reason why Batman kills in this film.  It's not a creative decision for the character - and that's evident because even the slightest bit of scrutiny would make it clear that's a dumbshit direction to take a new Batman (which I will explain below), it's because Snyder doesn't know how to make you care unless there's been an explosion (oh, and we still don't Zack), and that means folk have to die.  \n\nHe seems to think movies are just a collection of cool scenes, and those bits in between, like narrative and tensions are just padding and filler.\n\nTo make Batman a ruthless killer in this is SO mindboggling lazy and daft, because why give him gadgets and technology.  Just give him guns and lots of them and have him act like the Punisher.  I mean, they give him those gadgets that stop guns from working, and at that points it's just so they can give us a cool looking fight scene.  It makes no sense to the story whatsoever, it's not consistent and it's plain lazy story telling and film making.\n\nThis again is clear in the so, so, so sloppy way they artificially generate a reason for the two to fight.  By giving Batman a no kill policy and a strict view on justice, it would explain why he feels like Superman needs to be held accountable for his actions.  The drama could have (and in my opinion should have) been ratcheted up the more Superman begins to avoid scrutiny for what Batman would have perceived as crimes during Man of Steels final act.  \n\nYes, sure Batman has killed in the comics, and you can point to obscure, incomparable source material references, but it's overlooking the overarching and cleaner characterisation.  \n\nWhy did we need the Africa tangent?  Would have been so much more powerful to have Superman held accountable for the Man of Steel stuff, as all the marketing materials led us to believe.  Would have been great for Snyder to have seen that this uninteresting and crude approach to conflict and resolution has been re-assessed, but instead it feels like a deliberate \"fuck you\" to all those that thought he matured.  Another drop of piss in the ocean of piss that is this films story.\n\nThis film stinks of a lack of care.  It feels like they set aside a bunch of scenes they wanted to see and smashed them together.  This is such a shame and such a waste of budget, the amazing cast and my time, because if Suicide Squad is half as shit as this, the DC cinematic universe will be as good as dead.", "So Superman can sense that Lois Lane is in danger half way around the world but he can't find his mom when in the same city?\nOverall I found as many great moments as disappointments. Wonder Woman was my favorite aspect of the movie.  As little screen time and dialog as she got, I felt those moments told her story well, and her action sequences were phenomenal. I didn't find the Batman origin scenes at all necessary. I wish they spent more time on how old batman became more ruthless. Overall I did like what Affleck offered the role. He was a great Batman. Superman was Superman. Lois Lane was just annoying. Lex Luther was a disappointment. All he was was a crazy rich kid. I didn't see much mad genius. He plants a bomb and holds the dude's mom hostage. Brilliant!\nI really wanted to like this movie and I sort of did. It was beautifully shot. The action was spectacular. I loved seeing the three heroes together. But the story was blah and the Superman death was so melodramatic and Scottish it took me down from one of the best on screen big battles/fights I've seen.", "I'm pretty sure Zack Snyder read one superman comic, wiped his ass with it, then decided to do whatever the fuck he wanted with all the DC property involved in this movie ", "I can't help but be disappointed in character portrayals, once again Superman isn't Super, doesn't seem to be a symbol of Justice, or really do much else other then brood about. Can we please get someone else to write him? I think Henry Cavill could do an amazing job if he just had some good writing behind him.\n\nOn the topic of bad writing, Lex was pretty awful. I kept waiting for him to be in private and to actually act proper. To have that strange behavior he uses in public to just be an act, but it never came. Perhaps some jail time will change that if we ever see him again.\n\nBatman was pretty much on point, minus the killing people part. Someone else said it in another thread, but if he can be motivated by Superman / Wonder-woman to move past that and back to not killing people, I think his killing here will just be overlooked in the long run and not a big deal. I'm hoping the part with him and Luther towards the end was to show he knows he has to be a better man, since he could have easily ended Luther there.\n\nVisually was awesome, Synder definitely has that going on for him and then some. I honestly didn't mind Doomsday's visuals once they got to Doomsday 2.0, it looked more faithful and pretty imposing.\n\nWonder woman was awesome once we got to see her in battle, perhaps it was the lack of actual writing they had to do for her, but they didn't mess her up so I'm very grateful for that.\n\nPlot is all over the place and definitely needed to be tightened up and have a few more drafts made, there was good stuff in it but just too much going on and some very loose reasoning at times. Oddly enough, despite how there was too much going on there was also way too little on other things. We see Wayne manor in ruin and it seems like it is suppose to be this big moment, but at the end of the day we don't have a clue about what happened. Was this suppose to be a teaser for a Batman movie or what?\n\nI think this one will be very differently viewed among people, but I really liked the Flash Speedforce sequence. I don't particularly care all that much for the 'message' part of it and how it was definitely focused just on Justice League stuff, but how they made it look like a dream so that most movie goers would loop it in with the other crazy dream sequences was nicely done imo. It seems like something that will be an awesome surprise for a lot of people down the road, regardless of whether or not it fit in this particular film, the entire idea was pretty cool.\n\nHonestly, 5/10 if I remove my bias against poorly characterized characters. It was ok, I enjoyed the visuals a lot but it isn't a film I'd ever really bother to watch over again. I just hope DC learns from this film and the negative reception it is getting going forward - there is a place for two comic book universes to be grand, DC just needs better people to run theirs right now.

I assume that part wasn't a hallucination because of the floating papers when Bruce finally woke up in the background. \n\n-Were there any hidden significance in the desert hallucination scenes? I noticed the giant OMEGA symbol burnt into the ground. \n", "Who was the man dressed in a bat costume that killed everyone?", "Watching the videos for the justice league members should've been a post credit thing, not jammed into the middle of the movie.", "After hearing all the negativity surrounding this movie,  I have to say I will never listen to another \"critic\"  again.

I don't care that Batman mowed down a bunch of people because it conflicts with his character or something, or about Jesse Eisenberg's take on Lex Luthor being unorthodox. \n\nSo many decisions that characters make in this movie are only made because the plot requires them to. So many pieces of this movie are attached slipshod. Why does Wonder Woman have anything to do with anything? Same with Lois Lane? Why would a bunch of people getting shot in the desert make it look like Superman killed them all, as if that was his calling card? Why, why, why?\n\nI understand now why so many critics complain about the gloominess of the movie. As a fan of a great feel-bad movie myself, I think the issue is that the weight and darkness the movie tries to carry is constantly undermined by the ridiculously bad material. It's like someone forcing a dialogue about God, the Devil, and a deep existential crisis because their goldfish died. That they bought yesterday. ", "Just came out from seeing it. It's not with out its faults but I enjoyed it, but I also thoroughly enjoyed man of steel.\n\nI thought the intro sequence was great but should have cut when Bruce fell in the hole instead of turning into a dream sequence. \n\nBatfleck was great. A lot of people are complaining about him killing but I saw it more as he was treading that line of 'no more fucks to give' along with being mentally unhinged that he had his own twisted reasoning that as long he he didn't directly see or do the killing blow then he wouldn't lose any sleep over it. Example being he could have shot flamethrower guy in the head which would have made saving Martha easier, but instead shoots the gas canister on his back. It wasn't so much he was happy to kill people, it was more he didn't care as much anymore if criminals died in the progress of him achieving his goals. Which makes sense (for me at least) as an older batman, and was refreshing to see. \n\nAlso the dream sequence in which he's using guns was literally him experiencing his worst nightmare: superman dictatorship, supermen militia, alien invasion helping him, batman becoming desperate and resorting to use guns as a means to an end. \n\nI really liked Lex in this film, one of my major gripes with the movie was not enough lex and too much lois. If they had swapped that around I think it would have been much better and would have allowed lex's hate for superman being a reflection of his hate for his father to be more apparent. The cut to him first entering the ship and putting zods body in the chamber was one of the more jarring and rushed moments of the film for me.\n\nIt's already been said but batman not killing Martha was due to him realising supermans humanity; he was raised on earth, he has a mother like he does who might be about to die like his did. Also rushed over but in that moment batman also pieces together just how much lex contributed to all of this.\n\nWonder Woman was cool, looking forward to her solo movie. Alfred was great. Too much lois as I said. Doomsday was fine, could have been better. \n\nI like that they touched on superman being unsure if he should revel in the praise of others or distance himself from it, but it should have been developed more. Again too much lois, same as in man of steel.\n\nThe justice league drop should have stopped in the batcave with Bruce, we didn't need more than that. Or they should have included the bit with Wonder Woman and the email after the credits. There was no need for it right before batman and supes throw down.\n\nMain issue was the same I had with man of steel, the scene to scene transitions in editing were so abrupt and disjointed at times.\n\nOverall I'd give it a 7.5/10 for. Intend to get it on blu ray as I did for man of steel.", "Wonder Woman's theme song is metal as hell.", "Couldn't this movie have started at Superman going to the hearing and getting blamed for the explosion? What in the hell was the point of everything up until that? Start it all slow-paced with a little buildup to Superman speaking for his actions, then the place blows up and the plot kicks off.

", "Although critics may have hated it. For me though some might say\u2026. I\u2019m the reverse.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll start off by saying I actually did enjoy the movie, but it definitely should have been better. It felt very similar to watchmen where the \u201csum is less than the parts\u201d. I found each scene really well made, but it just didn\u2019t flow very well. He might need a new editor/storyboarder/whatever. I think with a little refinement Snyder can go from niche to amazing. I need another watch to really process everything and that really excites me, but that probably isn\u2019t a good thing for general audiences. I\u2019m really excited about the universe jumping off of this movie. \n\n\nI will say that even though it didn\u2019t get well reviewed I applaud DC for going a different route for their movies. They could\u2019ve easily just copied marvel and gone for simple, fun movies.( Don\u2019t get me wrong I really enjoy the Marvel properties) \u00a0Instead they *tried* to make them into something more deep, more substantial. [They tried to become\u2026. Something else.] \n\n\nNow some pros and cons cause making coherent sentences is too much work right now\n\n\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\n- I was on board with batfleck from day 1, and he\u2019s definitely the shining star of the movie. I\u2019ll say it: Better than Bale and West. ON PAR WITH Conroy and Greenwood. \n\n- Jeremy Irons is now my headcanon Alfred. Fuck it the whole cast was awesome.\n\n- Lois and Clark's relationship is streets ahead from MoS, though that\u2019s a pretty low bar\n\n- Fight scenes were great, especially Batman vs those thugs. \n\n- Dialogue was phenomenal. \n\n- If you like comic book movies I think you\u2019re going to love it as long as you don\u2019t expect it to be a marvel movie.\n\n- I really did enjoy the whole \"Bullet\" subplot, even though I know that probably could've been taken out. \n\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\n- I expected more of a dichotomy between public and private lex. He was cunning though. \n\n- They killed Mercy :-( \n\n- The scenes with the other leaguers felt as shoehorned in as the Thor scenes in AoU. Those could\u2019ve been more organic(arrow trademark). \u00a0\n\n- Clark died and comes back, completing the jesus metaphors. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if the funeral was 3 days later. Did they say how long it was? Hopefully this is the last metaphor. \n\n- Movie felt longer than it was. If you're a Marvel fan waiting for CW then this movie should end by the time it comes out on Blu Ray. \n\n\n**Sidenotes**:\n\nMy top 5 for superhero movies are ( with  heavy DC bias ):\n\n- Incredibles > TDK > CA:TWS > BvS > IM1 \n\n- Do batman and superman bring in too much baggage ? I feel like if this was made with lesser characters it would\u2019ve been better received. \n\n- I'm pumped for Suicide Squad and CW looks hands down amazing. \n\n\n\n**TL;DR: it's a lot like Fury Road for me. I loved it but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. 8/10 for me.**", "I feel like I'm the only one who liked this movie's action and batman.  In the theater when wonder woman shows up the crowd went insane.  Perfect intro for her.", "There was some interesting stuff in there. It isn't great, but not nearly as bad as critics panned it.  \nIt is superior to IronMan 3 and Age Ultron, which is baffling how they received better reviews", "It's a shitty, shitty, shitty movie. A few of my problems:\n\n- We spend all this time with Lex Luthor trying to get the common people to turn against Superman, then in the final climax, there are no common people! This entire arc did nothing for the film, except maybe suggest the question \"will humanity accept Superman?\" Which could make for a cool movie, but the movie has close to zero interest in dealing with that topic.\n- I've never seen a movie with such complete and utter contempt for its audience. Look, you can take an approach that's \"we'll introduce crazy shit, if you don't know what it is, the context should help\", but then WTF are those flying things in that Knightmare sequence? Why is there a giant omega there? I could even see \"it's for the comic fans, the common folk can ask them.\" But if your approach is \"we don't want to explain too much,\" WHY THE FUCK ARE WE SPENDING MULTIPLE MINUTES FOR SUPERMAN AND BATMAN TO EXPLAIN EACHOTHER THEIR MOTHER'S ARE BOTH NAMED MARTHA?\n- Granted, the Knightmare sequence was pretty cool. Specifically Batman shooting people tells us he's changed for the worse, it implies a lot about what has happened in the meantime. But what did it do besides being cool? Maybe that's enough for some people, but I can watch car commercials if 'being cool' is all I want.\n- If Superman's motivation to fight Batman is to save his mother, WHY THE FUCK DOES HE WAIT UNTIL HE HIMSELF IS PRONE TO SAY THAT? THERE WERE MULTIPLE MOMENTS WHERE BATMAN HIMSELF WAS PRONE? Yes, I know \"if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already\" is a cool line, but why not say \"Luthor will kill my mom\" instead? You could've saved us all about twenty minutes.\n- I was at the back of the theater, I've never seen so many people watch their phones during action sequences. Because they were pretty boring. They were completely unmotivated. Batman suddenly has the gift of prophecy because... Why? All I can guess is rule-of-cool, getting a nightmare sequence of Supergod being Darkseid's herald is pretty cool. But it serves little purpose besides \"being cool\". As for that carchase with Batman trying to get the kryptonite, why not instead, oh, I don't know, ASK LUTHOR FOR IT? AT THIS POINT IN THE MOVIE, YOU BOTH WANT TO USE THE KRYPTONITE FOR THE EXACT SAME FUCKING PURPOSE!\n- I respect the choice to delay the BvS grand showdown. But right as we're about to enter it, we cut to... Wonder Woman watching YouTube. And we get another dream prophecy with someone going back in time to warn Bruce. In a dream. I'm not sure if that's Flash or Cyborg, but how can they warn Bruce in dreams? I mean, I'm all for not sticking too close to the source material (Ledger's Joker was more comic book Riddler than comic book Joker), but this was a really weird way to introduce it. And the warning served no purpose besides \"being cool\". Because Bruce does nothing different because of the warning.\n\nLook, this is art and all art is subjective. I don't blame anyone for liking it. But to me, it's a shitty, shitty, shitty movie. I just saw it, I'll probably have more to say later. Unless I get downvoted to hell, I know how Reddit works.", "The Lego Batman trailer was 100 times better", "One sentence review:\n\nI haven't seen a train wreck that long since Super 8's actual train wreck.", "Best part of the movie was when everyone booed the Ghostbusters' trailer.", "It committed the greatest crime a movie can commit, it was boring.", "My two cents on what was overall a very enjoyable movie: \n\n1) A lot of people seem to be confused as to Lex LUTHOR's (with an O) motivation. My personal favorite iteration is in the Lex Luthor : Man of Steel comic, in which Lex despises Superman because he sees him as the end of mankind's drive for advancement or innovation. I believe the quote was: \"You are my nightmare. Why would we do anything, when you can do everything?\" Very, very compelling stuff. However, the movie seemed to realize they couldn't make Lex too agreeable of a villain, and appeared to kick his craziness and evilness into overdrive, yes, but it wasn't unwarranted. He gave an interesting example in the story of his father being under Nazi rule in East Germany, and that the all powerful (Nazis/Hitler, or Superman) have the potential to lead to evil. This is where his mistrust originates and I believe this motivation was close enough to the LL:MoS comics one to still be compelling while not having children side with LexCorp's CEO. Jesse Eisenberg should have been cast as The Riddler in a standalone Batman movie.  \n\n2) The Batman v Superman actual fight felt waaaaaay too quick. I've been waiting a whole year for essentially this one scene, and its multiple clear Dark Knight Returns homages kept me grinning throughout. Yet it ends just because their mothers happen to share a name? C'mon. \n\n3) God damn if that isn't the quickest use of a nuke ever. The President and his administration hardly have any idea who or what Doomsday is, but literally the second he is high enough up in the air with Superman, they decide to immediately nuke them. Wtf? Confusing snap judgement I felt, but then of course came another Dark Knight Returns homage with skeleton face Supes slowly recovering, so it ended up being worth it. \n\n4. No post credits scene? I was not surprised, just a bit disappointed. I thought for sure it would have something to do with Green Lantern, since he is the only New 52 league member absent from this movie. In my mind, the scene would have been some government or military agents surrounding an unknown alien object, and when the camera pans down, it is revealed to be a Green Lantern ring. My girlfriend may have come up with an even better one. The scene opens with Lex in his jail cell, and some guards tell him he is getting a new cellmate. Who walks in? The Joker. No dialogue even needed at that point. \n\n5. I absolutely love the maturity of the themes in this movie.  Luthor's apprehension toward absolute power. The world standing strong by their ideals of democracy in the face of the apparently omnipotent Superman. It just seems infinitely more intellectually stimulating than anything Marvel puts out. Not to bash Marvel, but their movies consistently have me feeling like I am watching a movie made solely for children. Batman v Superman makes you think, and then blows you away with stunning visuals. \n\n\n9/10. Definitely could have been improved in various ways, but overall was a fantastic film that hit every point it needed to hit. Cannot wait for the Wonder Woman movie and Justice League Part One next year. It was no Dark Knight, but god damn was this one great movie.

Did anyone pick up on references to the Golem of Prague? \n\nWhen all three characters are first sitting around the dinner table, Emmett is talking about how he wished he had gotten a tattoo, even if it was just his own name across his forehead. In the story of the Golem, the 16th century chief rabbi of Prague inscribed the Hebrew word *emmett* (truth) across the forehead of a clay monster in order to bring it to life so that it could serve as a protector of the Jewish community.

I don't know how much this helped, but one way or another, I really fucking enjoyed this movie.\n\nI loved the script, how each character got plenty of time establishing their motivations and backstory. How they all meshed together in various ways throughout the film. Not to mention how elaborately each plot point was foreshadowed and paid off. The picture of Howard's daughter, the bottle Michelle takes with her when she leaves her apartment, everything.\n\nI especially enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance, for so much of the film she's merely listening and reacting to Howard or Emmett, and that in itself is absolutely riveting and compelling. I loved the first dinner scene, where she starts to push Howard's buttons and flirt with Emmett. It shows in a very short space of time, how resourceful and intelligent she is (on top of the methods that she goes to in order to escape her room in the first 10 minutes of the film).

It felt like a scifi short story from an old sci-fi magazine, where often times the story gives the character the strengths they need to survive. That's the film's biggest storytelling strength, giving lots of little events and lines that Michelle an call back on later. Using the shower curtain for the gas mask/suit, figuring out how to break the lock on the door to outside, using the car to escape, etc, and then finally learning to fight for someone else instead of letting others fight for her, which she talked about when telling Emmet the story of what happened in the hardware store, and which played out when Emmet took the fall for her when Howard found the scissors and such. \n\nBesides, in an alien invasion, I've always though that the kind of people who would be best prepared to survive (preppers) are also usually the most crazy. That's what this movie was about.\n\nAdditionally, the misdirection regarding the actual threat outside was incredible. I had an idea that it could be aliens, but I thought it was more likely to be some sort of escaped lab experiment linked to the Taraguto corporation from the ARGs of both Cloverfield films. \n\nThere was still a link (Howard worked for Taraguto on satellites, and a satellite falling into the ocean is what awoke the first cloverfield monster, among other links), but it's mainly just supplemental. \n\nOne thing I thought was interesting and noticed immediately was that the music in the film's opening was very similar to the Overworld theme from Final Fantasy VII.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFs8-qGaoHU", "This was one of the best minimalist movies I've seen.

Based off of the trailer, I thought that it would be a really slow burner.  After all, almost the entire thing is just 3 people talking in a bunker.

You can't quite make it out. It looks familiar, yet alien at the same time. I got that sinking feeling immediately that something wasn't right. And even though I knew there was something sci-fi coming due to the connection to Cloverfield, I had no expectation that Howard was essentially right the whole time. Loved that it wasn't just more/bigger Cloverfield monsters. This movie universe was just blown wide open.\n\nEDIT: So apparently the director has been quoted saying that this film and the original Cloverfield do not share the same movie universe. Seems odd when they obviously went to the trouble of having a few internal references, including the SLUSHO! sign at the gas station. I think they could easily imply a connection between the two despite the surface level differences, but oh well.", "Experiencing this in IMAX was something incredible.

He's the only one close enough to Howard and knows all the ins and outs of the bunker.\n \n   The Partnership.\nMaybe they have a partnership of some kind?Howard and Emmett kidnap girls. Howard is trying to fulfill the desire to be a father again, and Emmett keeps raping and killing them. He begs Howard to teach him all he knows, but is sketchy and a loose cannon and keeps snapping and killing the girls, causing Howard to have trust issues with him.\nIt would explain why Howard acts so untrustworthy towards Emmett. Freaking out when he reaches and touches her. And when Michelle \"flirts\" with Emmett at the dinner table, Emmett's reaction and facial expressions seems some what devious to me.\nHe also talks to Michelle about Howard's stories the way a child talks about his parents, they are eager to talk about the person they learn the ways of life from, and they are obviously close enough for Howard to actually tell him personal stories.\n\n   The Dinner Table.\nWhen Michelle runs toward the door, they both go after her, but Howard first throws the dinner table at Emmett, blocking him from reaching her first. \nThe dinner table, which is a \"Family Heirloom\". The table he is so bent on keeping in good condition by the use of coasters, is thrown at Emmett because Howard knew if Emmett got to Michelle first, he could loose control and harm, even kill her. The girl he views as a daughter, needs protecting, which is more important than a family heirloom.\n\n   The Air Filtration Room:\nMaybe Emmett took Howard's daughter (of corse Howard is unaware of this) to the air filtration room, or a girl who he dressed up and was pretending to be his daughter. Emmett held her captive in that room, tying her to the ladder or in the craw space above the ladder with just enough mobility to scratch the word \"PLEH\" on the glass, maybe hoping Howard or someone would see the sign and would save her. \n   Why would Emmett offer to go in the vents with a broken arm? No one with a broken arm would do that, unless they had something they needed to hide. And Howard seems completely oblivious to what took place in that room, and he's too smart to leave evidence behind. \n  While Michelle is in that room, she doesn't communicate back and forth at all, which leads me to believe the room is soundproof, so the girl who is held captive in there couldn't scream for help.\n   And while Michelle is in that room, why didn't she unblock the door or investigate why it was jammed?\nThey don't even show the door at all and she just simply goes back threw the air vent. Who would do that? That's just too much work, and we already know there definitely is another way in that room they don't show.\n   Maybe they don't show the door because it would give away Emmett as the killer. \n   Because no one goes into the air filtration room unless maintenance is required, so how long has the door been \"jammed\"?\n   Maybe Emmett jammed the door a while ago to ensure Howard wouldn't catch him, and so the girl couldn't leave and was tied up to where she couldn't reach the door or vent, while holding the girl captive he went in and out of the room through the vent to visit his victim and terrorize her. Killed her when he was done and some how disposed of the body, maybe he hid her in the ceiling and that's what that strange stain is.\n   \n   Emmett really wanted to steel Howard's gun.\nEmmett was telling the truth about his plan to take to Howard's gun, and that was his plan all along and him helping Michelle make the suit was just a ploy to get close to her. \n   And Howard had previous experience with Emmett's shady character, which is why he shot him instead of just locking him in the jail cell style room to keep them all safe.\n\n  I believe everything in movies mean something or they wouldn't make a point to show it. \nIt's not like movies are just shot in someone's house last minute. The scenes and sets take time to build and construct, and that takes money. Movie produces or directors or what have you, wouldn't just throw a bunch of shit together unless they had some kind of meaning.\n", "Howard couldn't bring himself to say that Michelle is a a woman. Only a girl. Creepy. ", "Absolutely terrific!   Loved this movie, every second of it.  Don't worry thinking its a cash grab, just go to this movie.  You will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish.  A better movie than Cloverfield even.  ", "I am just throwing out some of my thoughts/analysis on some things I thought the movie was trying to symbolize. I thought it was an excellent movie, but I thought the third act was a little weak. If the film had been written without the intention of making a sequel I think it could have ended better. If the credits had rolled around the time Michelle takes off her helmet and breathes in the \"toxic air\" I think the ending would have been more powerful. This also is probably because it would further support my opinion on the film's underlying message, but I will share regardless.\n\nI think Goodman represents God. He creates this perfect living area and willingly picks two people, one man and one woman who are about the same age and who both could reproduce. He always talks about his daughter and the idea of creating a \"family\". God in the Christian doctrine is frequently referred to as \"God the father\". Goodman's character is directly responsible for the well being of not only the two people he has put under his custody, but also for the fish and plants and other living organisms in the bunker. Throughout the entire film, the audience is unsure what to think about Goodman, he is explosive and clearly unstable, yet we are perpetually reminded of his control over them. Not only through his character's hulking and looming presence throughout the movie (it seemed to me as we always knew he was close to them, regardless of where Emmet and Michelle were in the bunker), but also through Howard's constant need to feel appreciated. There were multiple times throughout the film in which Howard was asking the pair to appreciate him more or at least show some appreciation for keeping them alive and away from the air. He was very forceful about this on occasion and his need to be appreciated, arguably worshipped, was a key element to his character. \n\nThe moments in the movie that I thought supported my idea of Howard being God or at least, the idea of God (more on that later) were all the times in which Howard made any biblical references \"you have to build the arch before the flood comes\", the death of Emmet, and the times in which Michelle created something to escape or survive either the wrath of Howard or the apocalypse. \n\nFirst, the death of Emmet. Emmet is a character who is obsessed with Howard and is of complete subservience to him. Emmet is the subject of Howard's verbal assaults and physical punishment, yet he never opposes him until Michelle investigates the window and finds the \"help\". Emmet is representative of blind faith. He tells Michelle that Howard saved him from death, which is the reason why he likes Howard so much. Similar to people who get into bad car accidents and pick up religion, he is convinced that Howard's involvement in his life is like some sort of divine intervention. Thus, Emmet's blind faith in Howard counterbalances Michelle's unease and distrust towards him. Thus in the bunker you have, a man who fully believes in someone and trusts him with everything, a skeptic of this same person, and the person who is (supposedly) responsible for their current existence on earth, by saving them from the apocalypse. I hope you all can see this \"God\" thing that I am getting at. \n\nThe circumstances of Emmet's death also further this divine symbolism, for AFTER Emmet apologizes to Howard (he's asking for repentance in a way) he is shot. What does he apologize to Howard for? For wanting Michelle to \"respect him the same way she does Howard\". So, in a sense, Emmet was killed for trying to play God. This moment in the film, which I would say is a much better twist than the aliens at the end, shows that Howard is not at all who we think he is. He is no longer innocent and also no longer \"not some creepy pervert\". I think it also further illustrates the theme of faith that I believe is present in the movie. \n\nAs aforementioned, Michelle's use of tools and her crafty ways of getting out of things is indicative of a character who could represent individuality and secularity. She has a drive to be independent throughout the film, as established in the opening scene in which she ignores the boyfriend on the phone. How she is brought to Howard (God) is also essential to her character. Howard crashes the truck into her car and he admits this. She is not indebted to Howard in anyway, like Emmet is. It is also important that Howard has to push his authority on her much more than with Emmet. She is skeptical of him for the duration of the movie. She also is the only character who is invested in the truth. She is the one always exploring around, trying to figure out what to believe on her own, unlike Emmet who is perfectly content with abiding by whatever Howard says. Howard gets the most angry at her when she try's to figure out what is really going on, or anytime she attempts to reduce his power over her (like when she is flirty with Emmet and he freaks the fuck out). So when Emmet dies, we see that this man does not have good intentions and is not who we think he is. Michelle and the audience lose faith in this man at this moment, for it is indubitable that Howard is malicious. Howard has been forcing his authority on her since she first arrives at the bunker, but now he is forcing himself on her. This is expressed with the scene in which he has shaved and presents her with ice cream, right before she escapes. He has shown his true face to her and the cone/bowl presentation is phallic, for \"Megan used to like bowls\" (am I being too freudian here? I thought the cone kind of looked like a dick...). \n\nI'll start wrapping this up, so then Michelle escapes with her suit that she made herself to combat the world that she is still unsure of. She breathes in the air and voila, Howard was lying. She has used her own intellect and individuality to free herself from the captivity of the psychopath Howard. Until the giant penis worms show up. So at this point in time, the audience is a bit confused because some things Howard says are true now because the worms exist(I'm pretty sure Emmet makes reference to these before he is shot). She still manages to escape the one worm (which also looks like a dick), by using her intelligence and turning off the car alarm. She avoids the second sexual symbol, the flying spaghetti monster's vagina, by creating a tool with fire to free herself from the tentacles. Fire is one of the pillars of human evolution and I think it is by no coincidence that Michelle's final conquest of a massive, arguably divine figure is by creating fire. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the film is about people's struggle with faith. God is presented in some people's lives through (what they believe) is divine intervention or through forced acceptance. The character who does not follow blindly is the one who ends up surviving. I think this dynamic of the skeptic, the blind believer and God is illustrated in the scene in which they are playing the board game. The \"family\" is all together and the blind believer pulls the card, then Howard starts screaming at Emmet that he knows everything, he is omnipresent et cetera. Emmet is terrified at this moment and is convinced that Howard knows their plan. Yet Michelle saves him and says \"santa claus\". I thought this was indicative of the writers intention, for I have heard non-believers use the argument of \"how can you believe in God if you don't believe in Santa Claus\" or at least associating the two as examples of things invisible to people but believed as true, until they realize that it is impossible for Santa Claus to exist. I don't think the film pushed an atheist agenda, I think it was more one that argued for a rational and individualistic approach to questions of the unknown. \n\nI have more thoughts on this and also a separate theory about the film being more oriented around female maturation and independence, but I am interested in seeing what you guys thought of my analysis.\n\nTL;DR Goodman is God, Michelle is a skeptic, Emmet represents blind faith. The film argues for rational thought over faith through its symbolism and character development", "God that was so incredible. I can't decide which part I loved more. Loved the whole psycho thriller aspect of the first half and then after Emmitt gets shot, the plot goes on alien overdrive. It was so fucking well done. Really interesting concept of a sequel regardless whether the tacked on rumors were true. ", "Here's what I expected:\n\n* Dying woman to be killed horribly by the aliens during her closeup\n\n* Shaggy Dog ending where Michelle dies immediately after she escapes\n\n* Howard to say \"I accept your apology\" then dunk Emmet's face in the acid\n\n* Michelle to drink the whisky and accept death instead of making a damn bomb\n\n* Different ending where she sees the red flash in the distance, and the audience extrapolates that she finally understands what Emmet was talking about, explaining that the event was supernatural without being an action scene, followed by a fade to red or something.\n\n* My friend thought that the ending was going to be Michelle beginning to choke to death/get fucked up by the air, and cut to black as she dies\n\n* When Howard grabs onto Michelle's foot and get stabbed by nails, I thought they were going to make his flesh peel off\n\n* Thought Howard's face would be way more messed up by the acid\n\nThat said, this movie was fucking amazing and I'm happy I went. These are just some random thoughts I had during it.", "What I've heard from a lot of people is that they were disappointed by what happened after Michelle managed to escape the bunker. I absolutely wasn't one of those people. I spent much of the time when she was in the bunker thinking \"Man, what if that crazy bastard Howard is right? What if she gets out and the aliens are there? What will the Aliens look like? Will she escape them? If so, how?\". The scene immediately following the bunker escape was INTENSE and very much reminded me of the most intense parts of the movie Signs, which I loved. Seeing / hearing their interpretation of an alien invasion was disturbing, but in a good way.", "Here's my quick review:\n\nIt isn't very often that you can go see a movie at the theater and not have the slightest idea of where it'll take you. Even more rare is when a movie like that delivers a wholly original story that's even more satisfying than you ever thought it would be.\n\n*10 Cloverfield Lane* is a perfect reminder that films can still surprise us, delight us, and horrify us in a way that's never been done before. Mark my words, Dan Trachtenberg will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. His feature length directorial debut is a showcase for his absolute confidence and strength as a storyteller and filmmaker, and I can't wait to see what he does next.\n\nOf course, it always helps to have the likes of J. J. Abrams and Bad Robot standing behind you, and their experience and talent absolutely boosts this film into the stratosphere.\n\nAs far as acting is concerned, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives her best performance yet, and shows us a strong lead character who's completely believable in a situation that plays out like a horrible nightmare. Speaking of bad dreams, John Goodman turns in a performance unlike anything he's ever done before, and manages to be both strangely sweet and unbearably creepy. And John Gallagher, Jr. nails his roll perfectly and adds some much needed levity to a story that's almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic.\n\nI've been thinking about what film I could use to compare *10 Cloverfield Lane* to, and while I think even a comparison to a specific film might give too much away, I feel safe in saying that it is absolutely Hitchcockian. \n\nIt's a brilliant, brilliant movie that's told in the best possible way: by showing, not telling.\n\nYeah, it's nothing like the original *Cloverfield* and...Clovie doesn't make an appearance. But I'm in love with what they did and the idea of an anthology series of movies using similar details and threads.\n\nIt's a unique, different idea than Hollywood usually goes with, and it's so refreshing to see something like this happen.", "I absolutely loved this movie.\n\nRegardless of having no Cloverfield connections, it was incredible.

But his psychosis was always going to worsen as time went on. \n\n* The \"little princess\" moment was fantastic, just enough insight to be informative and creepy. You almost pity him because he's so clearly damaged and doesn't realise it. \n\n* Lots of Misery vibes, it's basically Misery with a random alien interlude. \n\n* The molotov in the alien poop chute was just ridiculous. Would've been better if she just defeated the grounded alien on her own rather than this huge spaceship sequence.\n\n* I liked how Michelle began by running away from someone, spent the film escaping someone who trapped her then intentionally ended the film by driving towards people/survivors. \n\n* The trailers didn't give anything away, always a bonus. \n\n* They should've just said she was designing clothes when Howard found the scissors. I found Emmet's excuse really dumb, and I also hate when someone just magically has their gun in their hand right when they need it. \n\n* I also thought her stealing the keys was poorly written. What if he hadn't stood her against the wall in that convenient position and why did she plan for him to find out two seconds later? Weird logic. \n\n* I feel like this is all a metaphor for something, particularly with them finding harmony briefly, the daughter/wife line blurring, Emmet's character, the woman being shut out and Michelle becoming a survivor who wants to be around people.

In fact, this is my very first post here EVER (please be gentle with the newbie... or not). Ok so here are my two cents in the billion dollar bucket. What I LOVED so much about this movie is that it wasn't an either/or situation. In any regard. As a viewer, and especially a fan of the suspense genre, you expect the twists, you expect to begin with one assumption but anticipate that assumption to be challenged or downright flipped upside down (usually the latter). Is Howard a terrible monster or the rescuing savior he so likes reminding Michelle that he has been? Is he a crazy conspiracy nut or the one person that saw \"the truth\" all along and tried to help others as best he could along the way? Or for those that have seen the film and are now questioning the ins and outs of Howard's psychosis, plans, knowledge, etc., was he really building a bunker for the world's demise or was it always a cover for containing his victims? Here's where my two pennies come in. I think Howard has had mental issues for a long time and was/is an abuser (obviously). I also think he was a true conspiracy theorist and genuinely built his bunker as a safe haven for himself and his family. I think it got to be too much for his wife and daughter and they split (don't blame them). That wasn't a lie. They really did leave him for Chicago and this broke an already broken man and pushed him right over the edge (or a second or third edge - let's put it this way - a defining edge big enough to lead to the capture and assumed killing of another stand-in daughter figure). I share this because I'm seeing a lot of comments implying it had to be either he was prepping for the end of the world with this bunker OR it was always a cover for his captives. No. I see it as actually quite a statement about the mental health issues that conspiracy thinking involves. How isolating and inherently narcissistic it is, and how if one is abandoned by his loved ones he perceives he is ready to protect, he can go further down that mental stability hole REAL QUICK.  He seems very formulaic, everything in its place, systems and rules are HUGE - that's very military. It's like it's his foundation and ONLY the foundation is left standing. The rest has gone to pasture. So in conclusion, he created this bunker to be a safe haven in the case of conspiracy fueled fears for the family that left him. In the meantime, he lost his family and lost his mind. He missed his daughter most of all so he, in now full on crazy mode, abducts young women that look like her and conveniently has a place to keep them \"safe\". A conspiracy mind is a terrible thing... period. ", "When she was crawling in the vents to escape and Goodman started stabbing through with the knife!  I was in the edge of my seat!

That bit was interesting but it went from a few mentions of his daughter to \"Help\" scratched in the glass to \"he did it\" in no time at all. I was hoping that since Emmett had helped build the shelter that he was secretly the one who had kidnapped/killed the girl and they'd fuck Howard up only to realise Emmett had done it and then a finale of him being the big bad guy.\n\nI think my problem was the pacing, \"you're not allowed in this room\" is explained once and has no more bearing on the plot.

So, I may be looking into this wayyy to much, I don't really know, but the ending feels like a continuation of the rest of the movie to me. The whole movie is about abuse, thats why the story about helping that little girl was in there, not just to show she wanted to help later, but to really emphasize the domestic abuse angle. The ending of the aliens continued the abuse because even though Michelle escaped her captor and abuser, she isn't whole yet and there are more demons to fight. In my eyes, the aliens represent the problems that Howard put into her. Once you escape, you aren't free. There are still demons that need to be taken care of.....

Also the alien and outside scenes felt unnecessarily long, almost like there was an alien quota to meet.

I thought it was a link to the start of the \"invasion\" but the other characters implied it happened very quickly. \n\nI also thought the call back at the end to Michelle's inability to commit and make a difference was quite clever, but the original introduction to this with the \"little girl and her dad story\" was quite sudden - you can pinpoint the moment the director thought \"and this is where character development begins\".\n\nBut overall a truly tense film, a 100 minute panic attack.

It was just stupid seeing him put 6 surveillance cameras it the baby room.  Same with the President talking about his son.  I don't think anybody cared.\n\n2.  It was not suspenseful at all, because there was so many cliches.  You knew everything that was going to happen.  For instance, when Angela Bassett said she'd be the godmother, you know she's gonna die.  Or when the US President told Gerard to kill him before he gets captured, you know he's gonna get captured and survive.

Exactly the same thing.  But this time, there's a throwaway line about \"No innocent civilians present\".  There isn't even any discussion about how weird it is that the same military action that caused this huge terrorist attack will also avenge it.  I think Gerrard or Morgan Freeman had some lines like \"It doesn't matter what the US did 2 years ago, because terrorists are just evil and will want to kill people anyway.\"  I don't know.  Maybe.  Maybe this ending will lead to the next sequel, \"The Whole World Has Fallen\".  \n\n5.  That decision Gerard Butler makes at the end is insane.

It's unfair to point out how hokey and unrealistic plots like these are. I get it. Some movies don't try to go for even remotely realistic plots, like the above mentioned *The Equalizer.* But, when you have a movie that bases its premise upon five major world leaders gathering in one city at the same time, you're just asking for it.\n\nFrankly, the plot was too far flung to appreciate the movie, because you're always reminded that the only reason the movie didn't end in the first 45 minutes is because Gerard Butler is the President's bodyguard. And the ways that the other world leaders die off are just hokey too. The German Prime minister is offed by a crooked Coldstream Guard, the Italian Prime minister decides that taking in the view on top of Westminster Abbey with his wife is a great security measure, the French President freaking arrives by boat, and the Japanese Prime Minister gets stuck in traffic. **Stuck in traffic!** What kind of idiot decides to take the route across the bridge with heavy traffic? The only reason the US President survives is because Butler decides to be unpredictable and advance the arrival by an hour... which still causes them to be attacked anyhow and raises even more questions since the other leaders had practically already arrived. What, was the US President supposed to be late to the funeral?\n\nAnyhow, the President is ambushed, rushed to Marine One, and somehow still there are no fighters from either the British or American Airforce overhead.

Gerard decides to be suicidal and assault a building with a hundred bad guys inside. He runs in while the elite, highly trained soldiers run into the open and get gunned down for no reason. Finally, Butler goes stabbity stabbity on the bad guy's son, kills everyone, and escapes a giant explosion by falling into a shaft. Then the movie ends with Morgan Freeman drone striking the bad guy who was all behind it. (By the way, this was all because the bad guy's sister died by a drone strike two years ago. Apparently familial demise gives you super conspiracy powers. Go figure.)\n\nThis plot is as hokey as Denzel Washington working at Home Depot while murdering people in his free time.\n\nIf you enjoy some legitimately pulse pounding action, but can excuse the hilariously ludicrous plot, you'll get a kick out of *London Has Fallen.* Just leave your brain at the door when you enter. 4.5 out of 10.\n\n", "Gerard Butler, are you trying to destroy your career?

Two years is a long time, but you can\u2019t predict someone being stuck in traffic on a bridge, or chilling at the Palace. \n\nI feel like a lot of scenes were brought up and meant to be powerful with consequences that would affect our heroes in the future, but they were then ignored. When the bad guy talked to Morgan Freeman about giving up the president, or else more would be killed? Of course he said no. And guess what, after that there weren\u2019t any more big terrorist explosions or huge swaths of innocents killed. It just became a man hunt for the president and the only people who died after that were people fighting on both sides.\n\n \nMore importantly, the beginning was a drone strike killing dozens of civilians to get to one bad guy, but he got away and so did a few of the other important members. So the United States really sucks and it makes sense he was angry. I figured this would come up and talk about how they shouldn\u2019t do that anymore and at least say that they were wrong.

The final fight happening in a boring construction site was lame. Why not shoot up Buckingham?\n* Angela Bassett was wasted \n* Everything's a cliche\n* The CGI is terrible\n\n\nUgly\n\n* The movie's politics are bad. Had this been released in the 80s or 90s it probably wouldn't have mattered as much, but having your main character shout \"Go back to Fuckheadistan or whatever\" and then point-blank execute a middle eastern man is outrageous. Having your terrorists infiltrate everyday society while millions of refugees IRL are trying to escape hell on earth only to be accused of this is even worse.\n\n* The entire attack on London was a revenge plot after the US blew up the villain's daughter's wedding. He had a point to make about the US sending its poor to fight its battles and get blown up overseas, and about how we rain death from the skies. How does the movie and its characters react to this? By fucking killing him with a drone strike in the closing moments and then cheering about it.\n\n\n\n\nOverall? It's an okay R rated action movie with some okay actors and some okay action and some really bad morals.

The subtitle for this movie should have been \"Gerard Butler stabs the shit out of everybody....Again\". Butler and Eckhart and great and realize what kind of tone they need to play for this work and they work great together. Always kind of funny that Eckhart is playing an older President to Butler's veteran Secret Service Agent and he is only 1 year older than Butler.\n\nEverybody else from the first movie was pretty much wasted especially all of the President's cabinet. Jackie Earle Haley and Melissa Leo only have 2-3 lines each and probably filmed their roles in a day or two. Bit of a shame for such good actors. Freeman completely phones his role in but its basically the exact same role as the first movie so its not like he had to do anything crazy.\n\nMovie could have done without all of the random British characters they added into the movie for no reason mainly the British chick Jac who is a friend of Butler and just shows up at the beginning of the 3rd act and has everything figured out. Was she really necessary? Did Gerard Butler owe Tom Hardy a favor?\n\nNot as good as the first movie, but still a pretty fun movie to watch.", "Nice action but stupid logic deluxe.\nBest scene is when they crashed the chopper and butler tells the president: \"Get out of here! this helicopter can explode any second!\"\nOnce butler leaves the helicopter he finds the president like 2 meters from the helicopter.

Even more shocking from the same guy was the line \"This is the most dangerous time since the Great War.\" So WW2 when bombs were being dropped on cities was not dangerous?

Special shoutouts to Tina Fey and Chris Abbot, they were really amazing!\n\nI still had some problems with it, I mean the fact that not a single Afghan main character was played by an actor of Afghan or even or Middle Eastern descent was, erm, problematic to say the least.

Even tiny stuff like Mr. Otterton's graying hairs, the various canines' nosepads, or even stuff like when Nick was playing around with Bellwether's hair, the movie is just bleeding with fine-combed detail. Not easy when you have just about every single kind of mammal represented.\n\nEven then the locale and huge range of scale within the city of Zootopia is amazing, especially since the vast majority of the film is done on Judy's and Nick's level so people like elephants or Bogo all the way down to hamsters gives the feel of such an impressive scope to everything around them. Even cooler to see how Zootopia accommodates everyone due to that fact.\n\nAs everyone else has already said, the characters feel real in their personality, the story is a little cliche but well executed, and overall it's a solid film.

It takes its chosen issues head on, but in a way that lets everyone feel like it's talking about them. As someone else said, it's not about the racism or sexism of a specific time and place, it's about the ideas as a whole, and shows how everyone experiences prejudice in one way or another.\n\n5) What a fantastic piece of propaganda.

As a joke I said instead why don't we see Zootopia as a joke because I REALLY don't care about London has Fallen. Somehow I got everyone to agree and so we went in knowing literally nothing, other than there was a sloth in the movie at some point. We were all shocked immediately by the darker/depressing themes of giving up and settling and of course found them hilarious. \n\nIt turned out to be a very serious movie covered up in incredibly beautiful animation and cute animals. Also I can't stress this enough the voice acting and the animation are goddamn incredible. Personally I believe this is most well-animated movie I have seen...ever. The themes of racism, sexism, and corruption are not too heavy handed that they become annoying however they are there for anyone who may have been forced to take their kids to what was assumed to be a rather childish movie, but disney managed to make this a movie enjoyable for kids both young and old as well as adults.

The movie tells a well-constructed story in a fleshed-out world, with absolutely *brilliant* design and animation, and a cast of lovable characters. It's on the high end of what you would expect from a Disney movie.\n\nBut what really, *really* made the movie for me was the surgeon-like precision and delicacy with which it imparts general lessons about prejudice and acceptance. A lot of people have been saying the movie has allegories for racism, sexism, and the like, but I think it actually does *better* than that. You can take *any* sociological lesson away from this movie that you come into it with, and that's the real beauty of it.", "I found it really nice that they credited first the lead designers, animators, etc. at the closing credit, instead of the lead actors and actresses.

Judy thinks highly of Nick, believes he'd be a great cop and shouldn't let the fact that he's a fox define him, and considers him to be her friend. Almost immediately thereafter Judy speaks to the public and expresses her belief that all predators are savages and predetermined to behave in a dangerous way based on their DNA. She even admits that she finds Nick to be dangerous based on his genetics. How do these two schools of thought interact with each other? Is my friend of a different ethnicity really my friend? What if he believes I am inferior/dangerous/stupid/untrustworthy due to my ethnicity? Is he still my friend? The movie takes a position and says \"No.\"\n\nConsider this: a person is accused of being racist for their treatment of blacks. The accused responds truthfully that there's no way she is racist because her best friend is black! Couldn't Judy have made a similar argument if she was accused of being racist? And would her argument have been persuasive? I don't think so, especially before the apology scene, because despite being friends with Nick, she holds a belief that he is inferior due to his genetics. So you, you might have good friends that are of a different ethnicity, but does that preclude you from being racist? I don't think so. ", "Did this movie get political?

I'm glad that I was wrong. The citizens of Zootopia being divided by Prey and Predator was a simple and clever way to introduce the idea to kids, but not make it so ham fisted that adults would be bothered by it. \n\nThe plot is pretty cliche. Judy Hopps, a small town bunny, aspires to make a difference in the world by defying the odds and becoming the first rabbit to graduate the Police Academy, and solve cases. The cliche in this case, isn't a detriment to the overall story of Judy Hopps and her reluctant ally, Nick Wilde. It's predictable, but still very entertaining.\n\nAs for the stereotypes, there all animal related and the characters are constantly throwing them at each other at the beginning of the movie. Such as Wolves howling, Foxes are sneaky, and Rabbits are cute, fluffy, and multiply like, uh, rabbits.  There's even a scene when Judy first enters the Police Station shortly after graduation where she has to explain that the  word, \"Cute,\" is a slightly offensive term for bunnies. A lot of the animal stereotypes are played for a gag, such as the sloths working in the DMV, but they don't take away from the overall message.\n\nFor parents with younger or more sensitive kiddos, there is a jump scare in the movie when Hopps and Wilde enter an abandoned hospital. I saw it coming a mile away, but I was sucked into the world of Zootopia that it caught me off guard as well as everyone else in the theater.\n\nSpeaking of the world, Zootopia is absolutely beautiful. Every scene is gorgeously animated and brought to life.

Do it Disney.\n\nYou can read [my full review here](http://gorgview.com/zootopia)! :) \n", "Really, really enjoyed this movie - unexpected references, and it was fun. Even though it's a kid's movie, I think the older kids (and I mean older than 4) will enjoy it a lot more than really little kids - there was some really quick, easy-to-miss one-line funnies that went over some of the little ones but made the older ones laugh. \n\nI didn't expect the movie to move so quickly into its story - that was a nice surprise. The pacing was pretty tight; the only \"slow\" scene was the sloth scene and that ...well, yeah. That makes sense. The film was quick to keep the story moving, and the callbacks weren't super cheesy. It was like...Hot Fuzz Jr. I really, really enjoyed the dynamics of Nick and Judy. Definitely ended up wanting to see more of their antics - Bateman's perfect at playing the fox, but there's so many great back-and-forth moments between Bateman and Goodwin. I feel kind of dirty for saying that there was some fantastic chemistry but there you go. \n\n\n^God ^damn. ^All ^those ^repressed ^childhood ^feelings ^from ^Robin ^Hood ^- ^huh. ^Who ^knew.\n\nedit: it was nice that the movie didn't end up being the classic disney romance. The buddy cop dynamic worked awesome. But at the same time, it would have been surprisingly okay in this instance. There's a lot of really good potential for a series that features short stories and small cases they solve.  edit 2: also, ha. the shakira parts. I think I just repressed those. makes the movie better.", "I swear I'm not a furry, but I found Gazelle oddly attractive.", "Better than Frozen and Inside Out, Zootopia redefines animated classic for children and adults. Absolute smashing success without compare.", "When the window of the fast car rolled down to show the sloth in it, the whole theatre died. This bit is easly the best example how you shoud set up a joke that makes people laugh out loud. Deadpool also did that with Francis", "tbh I thought it was some disease causing the predators to go feral, I was totally expecting Hugh Laurie to appear as a doctor(vet?) and be like \"it's never rabies\"", "[removed]", "[Bellwether has a little note to call Doug](http://imgur.com/Z5OzZk6)\n\nThat was fantastic little detail right there", "These might be the best looking animated animals we've ever seen.", "That The Godfather reference killed me. It was so well-thought and fitting for the plot. And I love how Mr. Big turned out to be a mouse protected by polar bears.", "anyone got the feeling of these two? http://i.imgur.com/S86oike.jpg", "Those lemmings were really adorable", "Loved the movie with the references of The Godfather, Breaking Bad, the Aristocats, Frozen and probably many more i didn't notice", "I LOVED this movie. Absolutely loved it. Honestly, this is comparable to some of Pixar's best work. If you're turned off from seeing it because you think it's a kids' movie, I really think you owe it to yourself to reconsider because this was really, crazy good.      \n  \nFirst, there are tons of jokes here aimed directly at adults, and I would argue most of them land really well. We have references to pop stars, mob movies, hit TV shows, dealing with bureaucracy, etc. that were clearly made with adults in mind. Disney picked this strategy up from other studios and it works really well here.  \n  \nSecond, there's something refreshing and captivating about the world these creatures live in. The scene where the protagonist, Judy, first arrives in Zootopia by train, drew me in. Each of the different eco-zones in the city is beautifully crafted and interesting. If the city existed (say, as a theme park), it would be a place I would want to visit.  \n  \nThird, the character development in this film is top notch. Judy Hopps and Nicholas Wilde are not perfect, cute little creatures. They have serious character flaws. They both have their own form of prejudice stemming from childhood experiences. Despite that, they're able to come together and become close friends in a way that's moving and believable.  \n  \nBut it's not just the main characters. It seems like every named character has something interesting to offer in terms of development. Take Mayor Lionheart for example. Here we have a character who starts out as an obvious loudmouthed caricature. But by the time the movie reaches the end, we find out he has both good and bad reasons driving his actions. Why does he [do what he does?](#s \"i.e. capture the predators\") You can say that he's acting selfishly to protect himself or you can say that it was out of a genuine desire to protect the city. Look at Judy's parents. At first, they don't believe in her because they're worried about the world crushing her spirit, but slowly they come around to supporting her. Even for a kids movie, the characters are well rounded and top notch.  \n  \nSome have said the story is predictable. I can't speak for those people, but at the risk of sounding dim, I'll admit I didn't really see what was coming until the train station scene. It was a genuinely mild surprise to me with, once again, a relatable character acting for understandable reasons (i.e. being treated poorly).  \n  \nFinally, the film borrows from Aesop's playbook to bring us an important moral that is worth learning: Try everything, don't let people box you into a stereotype, and be open minded about other people and who they can be. There were obvious references that paralleled with race and issues of inclusion that I thought were really well done.  \n  \nOverall, this movie at least a 9 out of 10 for me. I know you think it's a kids' movie, but please--don't just make a snap judgment. Be open minded and give it a try.  \n  \nA+", "Holy crap that was *a lot* better than I expected. I mean I like disney, but usually their films are a bit campy, and forced. \n\nBut holy shit that was good. \n\nI mean other than the obvious \"racism is bad, everyone is equal\" morals/metaphors/allegories, it was really subtle too. There were some parts where I went \"wow that was really clever\". \n\nI went in expecting a solid 6-7/10, campy, catering to young kids, wanting to sell toys and spinoffs. What I got was a solid 9/10, with great story telling, amazing characters, tremendous writing and acting, and more subtlety than expected. \n\nThe only part I really can complain about is that awful shakira song. So hamfisted and forced, and really doesn't fit the mood at all. But that wasn't *that* bad. I just hated it. \n\nSeriously though, if you're on the fence about seeing it, do it! It's seriously good. Honestly I was blown away by it. It's not just your average campy disney movie trying to sell toys, and create a myriad of spin-offs and cash-ins. It's actually a good standalone movie, with a fantastic story and all the stuff I already said. \n\nTL;DR; Went in expecting cynical 6/10, got a fantastic and heartfelt 9/10. Also fuck that shakira song. ", "Judy's parents not wanting her to go into the career she wanted to go into hit home way to hard for me. ", "After reading through a lot of the comments, I felt a compulsion to say something.\n\nDamn near every animated kids movie for *at least* the past two decades has had some kind of overarching message in them, often multiple messages, something more than just \"the hero does cool stuff and saves the day\". I'm actually having trouble thinking of a Disney movie that *doesn't* have any moral to it at all.\n\nJust a few examples: \"Don't take life/time/friends for granted\" (Up, Toy Story, Lion King). \"Kids need space, but also appreciate and respect your parents\" (Finding Nemo, Brave). \"Be open to new experiences and new ways of doing things\" (Toy Story, Brave, Monsters Inc, and I know it's not Disney, but HTTYD). And even \"don't prejudge/underestimate people\" (Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, Ratatouille, Wreck-it-Ralph, Lilo and Stitch, and again not Disney, but Shrek).\n\nVirtually no one calls these movies \"propaganda\" even though plenty of them have clear messages they're trying to convey to the audience, including kids. Not even the movies about prejudice and preconceptions normally get called propaganda. Granted, a lot of the movies with a message about prejudice, usually focus the message on a discriminated individual rather than groups.\n\nZootopia just takes that same message and makes it clear that it also applies to more wide-reaching real life examples like race. The message in this movie isn't that new, even for Disney. What's new is that they weren't afraid to use a more controversial example of how this message can be applied, and the movie doesn't dance around that fact at all.\n\nMaybe you didn't like the way the message was handled or portrayed in this movie, or maybe you didn't like the message at all, but the simple fact that it has a message and doesn't cushion it's real-life implications doesn't make this any more propagandic than dozens of other kids movies. ", "[deleted]", "Firstly I hope Disney continues to use Alan Tudyk for the rest of his life as a character in every flick, because he is an amazing voice actor, wouldn't have even recognized him if it weren't for the Duke Weaselton gag. \n\nNow, I agree with most of the comments here but my only criticism is that it fell to the bootstraps myth again. They spent all this time establishing that she'd have difficulties as a bunny, and instead of playing to her strengths as a bunny she kind of just blunders onto some clues and lucks out with others. Other than the pen recording and some quick math and plant knowledge, she doesn't actually do anything. Nick did most of the work and thinking. It's mostly just a pet peeve of mine, when children's movies mistake tenacity and lots of luck for hard work. I would have preferred if she hadn't just given up, run away from the mess she started and gone home only to luck out on hearing a colloquialism, but instead had kept working on solving the case. But that's just my personal opinion. \n\nAlso did Disney sneak a gay couple in there? The Oryx neighbours have a hyphenated last name and live in an implied one bedroom. I mean they could easily be brothers too, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was ambiguous on purpose. ", "This may be the cleverest animated movie made since Paranorman. What I love is how they show both sides of the argument well, and made the characters believable. Most of all, I loved the way the characters were animated and how they looked. Everything was so smooth and the animals were so diverse. I love the contrast between the small town of the rodents, to the large city with elephants. The city itself is interesting. I love how it has 4 different sections. Hoping in whatever sequel we get, they will go to the desert one, or take more time in the rainforest and tundra areas.\n\nEdit:Whoops, Desert, not dessert. Thanks lol", "I love this movie.\n\nOne of my favorite parts is Duke Weasleton. When they mispronounced his name as \"Wesselton\" and he corrects it to \"Weasleton.\" His first name is Duke too.

I can see someone trying to mess with the Habitat Machine that makes it possible for all the animals to live in one city.", "Zootopia is absolutely fantastic.  Every single character in this movie is extremely likable right when you meet them.  Their quick wit and humor make them enjoyable to listen to.  The dialogue is not overly exposition heavy (which can happen a lot in animation movies for younger audiences).  Even though there were some pretty obvious themes being expressed in this (racism, speciesism\u2026?), it never felt like the dialogue explaining those themes was too blatant.  The things the characters were saying seemed like stuff that would have really been said.\n\nThe visual comedy in this movie is excellent, especially in that opening sequence when Hopps arrives in Zootopia for the first time.  Every species of animal had their own little pigeonholed quirk that made it really enjoyable to dart your eyes around the screen.  My favorites were the giraffe gags, like when one is coming up the escalator and you see its neck go all the way and out of frame until you see the body, or the giraffe ice cream stand, and the giraffe car that Hopps had to ticket.  Another one that I loved was the lemings all following each other to buy \u201cpawpsicles\u201d haha.\n\nThere was also a lot of great humor for adults to pick up on as well.  My favorite was the Frozen reference that the police chief made.  Another good one was the police wolf at the end that was sent undercover in sheep\u2019s skin, hue hue.\n\nThere are only two little issues that I have with Zootopia.  The first one is that after the first half, the visual gags became less and less, and those were my favorite elements of this movie.  The second is the way to story was revealed to us.  This movie is essentially a whodunit/whydunit mystery, and along the way Hopps and Nick find new pieces of evidence.  The problem is that the audience never has a chance to figure it out for themselves.  Every time the main characters discover something, it is immediately explained to us, and the audience was never given a previous example to base that guess on.  There aren\u2019t any callbacks (or none that I could tell) to previous events in the movie that make the clues really CLICK.  It\u2019s more of \u201cOh this new thing is related to this new thing.\u201d  The audience doesn\u2019t get to piece it together, it\u2019s pieced together for them.\n\nOr maybe on a second viewing I\u2019d see EVERYTHING I missed haha.\n\nBut hey, it\u2019s an animated Disney film targeted for youngins.  And I loved it.\n\n8/10.  Excited for the inevitable sequel that will not be as good but hopefully still entertaining.\n", "One thing I just noticed on my second showing of it was the lack of dogs and house cats. It makes total sense though, becuase humans were not around to domesticate them. Very nice work by the whole team at Disney. This has climbed to one of my favourite Disney movies of all time!", "I enjoyed the movie a lot. The environment it created is brimming with imagination. It was so exciting to see how roles were filled by animals and how different species interacted with each other. I would love to have a discussion of some of the grievances I had about it though. Massive spoilers below.\n\nA criticism I have for the movie, however, has to do with how the plot progressed. Specifically, the film didn't do a good job convincing me that she should have felt guilty about dividing Zootopia. Clearly, what was dividing predators and prey was that animals were going savage; she was not the cause, she just discovered it. I can't really get behind a character that identifies this enormous problem, somehow concludes that she is at fault without further investigation and then quits.\n\nI also thought it was cheap how Judy discovered the source of how animals were going savage. She had exactly one scene where she was back home and by chance, she discovers the nighthowlers, whose effects are immediately explained by her mom. Not much suspense there. When plots are designed like that, they leave no satisfaction for viewers who are trying to solve the mystery on their own.\n\nAnother criticism I have was the conflict between Judy and Nick. Nothing actually develops in their relationship between the time that they \"break up\" and get back together. Judy's guilt over what she said is instantaneous and Nick is just a snarky comment away from unquestionable forgiveness. They didn't actually overcome any conflict with each other before becoming 100% chemistry buddy cops.\n\nWith that said, there's no doubt that the world crafted in Zootopia fills you with wonder. There's so much potential for new species, crime stories and foreign cities that I can't wait to discover in a sequel. I just hope they can make their stories a little more nuanced. ", "Judy & Nick for True Detective Season 3", "Man, what an excellent film. I love the fact that it handles prejudices in a way that doesn't feel preachy. \n\nBut damn, how many references to Frozen were there?", "I thought this movie was amazing, a lot better than what I had anticipated. I went in not expecting much, but it really blew my mind how well executed everything in this movie was. It had a perfect blend of everything. The story was a simple idea that is complicated enough to wow the children viewers with the twists regarding who the villains actually are, yet for the adults it's just astonishing to see how realistic the main ideas of the movie are. The motifs are incredibly relevant and fairly inspiring. The animation was also really good and it's refreshing to see a REALLY good Disney animal movie again - something that hasn't happened in a long time. Off of that, Nick reminded me a lot of Dodger from Oliver and Company.  ", "Disney proves once again why they\u2019ve been doing this animation thing at such a high level for such a long time.

The little Fennec Fox had me in tears when he spoke and every exchange between Judy and her parents gave me a good laugh. \"Oh, thank God! She's a meter maid!\"\n\nBateman and Goodwin carried the story and had wonderful chemistry. The world was interesting and catered to each animals' needs perfectly. Much like Bojack, the animals exhibited personality traits like animals do in real life. The attention to detail was superb and the animation top notch.\n\nThe song \"Try Everything\" had a great message, which I felt was touched on throughout the movie. There was plenty of action and a few  really well thought-out jokes. I especially liked the reference to Breaking Bad in the train car.\n\nIf anyone has images of the bootleg movies that the Weasel was selling, I'd love to see them! I caught glimpses of them and they all seemed hilarious.\n\nEdit: Words", "Loved it.  The facial expressions they pulled in this one were top notch.  Nick's turn from cocky to busted was hilarious and added so much to that scene.", "([spoilers] is in the thread title, so I hope this doesn't cause issue for anyone.  Tried four different spoiler tags and none worked, even the one suggested in the sidebar, so oh well, here goes)\n\nI expected to like Zootopia, and I ended up liking it even more than I thought I would because of the way they handled some very important issues in a polished manner.  The subjects of racism, prejudice, gender discrimination, and racial profiling are especially pertinent in our current socio-political climate.  Many plot elements of the movie can be interpreted as analogies to Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric, Clinton's \"Apex Predator\" speech, Islamophobia, Black Lives Matter, and Eugenics.  Production began in 2013, it was written and conceived even earlier, before many of the events that we associate it with today. \n\nIt has a timeless theme, prejudice (or bias as Byron Howard states in this article http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-disney-fixed-a-huge-mistake-with-zootopia-just-one-1753845684), and it presents it in a remarkable way.  There is no ham fisted, one dimensional character who is a parody of a bad cop or any particular politician, it's all revealed through the flaws and mistakes of the two protagonists Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde.  We learn of their background, their childhood experiences, their ambitions and setbacks and how that led to the internal struggles they must overcome to become ethical adults.  \n\nWe see Judy Hopps struggle with her own bias as she befriends and collaborates with Nick Wilde.  She seems to not recognize this as an issue for herself, ignoring her parents' fears of the city and the foxes therein.  She even tries to overcompensate for her species' general dislike of foxes, standing up for Nick Wilde when he faces discrimination and then buying the Jumbo Pop once he claims to have lost his money.  Only later when she presents her theory on the biological basis behind predatory species reverting to violence, and subsequently hurting Wilde, does she realize the extent of her own bias beliefs.\n\nBy presenting this story with animal characters, the audience is forced to confront their own beliefs.  Nothing about rabbits being fearful of foxes seemed offensive or shocking, it's even humorous as they use prop gags with a fox repelling line of pepper spray and tasers.  Hopps' parents seem all the more lovable and quaint because of their fears of the city and warnings about predators.  Yet this is not untamed nature, this is Zootopia, a place founded upon a civil contract that animals of all types can coexist.  To hold such bias tears at the fabric of their society, particularly when it is used by figures of authority to create a climate of fear and oppress minorities.  The use of a muzzle as a means of control, stifling their speech is an effective metaphor that appears natural in an anthropomorphic setting.  Perhaps the most complex use of animal as metaphor comes in the form of Assistant Mayor Bellweather.  The antagonist being a sheep who seems docile and likeable, yet is eventually revealed to be a perpetrator in a conspiracy to instigate violence and seize further control through fear.  It begs the question, is her course of action the result of self-determination, or is she trapped in a paranoid belief system that justifies oppression by manifesting the very thing she fears? \n\nThese themes are not anything I could have anticipated.  While there have been many children\u2019s movies that have had dark elements and topical subjects, Zootopia pushed the boundaries of what they could include yes still function as a family movie.  It\u2019s a buddy movie with messages about friendship, making mistakes, and forgiveness that are equally as important.  There were multiple intense, heart wrenching scenes that made the characters all the more human, or anthropomorphic as it were.  Zootopia is truly a gem that teaches some lessons we needed to hear. \n", "I've seen it twice already and holy crap is Zootopia a damn good movie. I honestly was going in with little expectations based on what I've heard about it, but now it's easily not only my favorite Disney animated movie, it's a serious contender for my favorite movie of all time. ", "That was pretty good.  I enjoyed it much more than Frozen and Big Hero 6. ", "I think people are going to over what is the saddest lesson here. Hopps learns the truth about Night Howlers from Bunnyburrow, a small hick town. The folks there treat the behavior of Night Howlers like it's common knowledge, but no one in Zootopia seems to be aware of it. The animals that went \"savage\" were never tested for eating Night Howlers, and a cure was developed after the case was resolved at the end of the film.\nThat's depressing in two ways. \n\n1) Night Howler psychosis might have been a known trauma but no medical advances were done until after the issue was sensationalized.\n\n2) The small hick town is so detached from modern society/the big city that their issues aren't even on the world's radar and visa-versa. Sure, they have newspapers, but Judy's parents didn't seem at all interested in the predator case sweeping the city. And did Judy's relative that went crazy over Night Howlers ever get the proper treatment, or is he just trapped in the loony bin?", "Well... I know the furries will love it.\n\nIn all seriousness, I was surprised by how dark this film was. It covers some really mature themes for a kids film- political corruption, racism [spoilers](#s \"State-enforced racism, even!\"), fear of the police, drugs... it was kind of bizarre seeing a plot that wouldn't be out of place on CSI acted out by cartoon animals.\n\nEven Judy isn't free from prejudice, which is refreshing to see in a main character- she keeps a bottle of what is essentially pepper spray by her side through most the movie, specifically formulated to work on foxes. She almost uses it when she first meets Nick, and [spoilers](#s \"Nick takes notice of this, and calls her out on it after she gives a press conference where she says that predators have a biological urge to be... well, predators. They have a small fight, and Nick almost gets her to pull the spray on him.\") It's a heavy moment.\n\nThe movie doesn't try to hide that the world isn't perfect- it's impossible for harmony to exist at all times, and people are always going to marginalize and look down on you for what they think you can and can't do. Not everyone can be anything- there are always limiting factors in place, but we should try our damnedest to overcome them, whether it's a physical limitation or just how people look down on you.\n\nOnto the technical side of things, the voice acting in this is spectacular- I started crying when Judy [spoilers](#s \"comes crawling to Nick, begging to be forgiven after she pretty much caused Zootopia to fall out of harmony due to implying predators- and only predators- can become 'savage'.\") J.K. Simmons is on point as the mayor, Jason Bateman is hilarious as Nick, Idris Elba was friggin *awesome* as Chief Bogo, and after seeing Jenny Slate as Assistant Mayor Bellwether, I realized that she needs to be in more films. The characters look better here than they have in any Disney 3D film before.\n\nOne last thing: if you go into it, be prepared to invoke the MST3K Mantra at certain points- for instance, Nick's establishing scene includes a sequence at an ice cream parlor. It could be Gelato (which can be made with water), but now that I've gotten home, I find myself wondering where they got the milk. Ew.\n\nOn a related note, Nick and Judy are coming to Disney parks and...

Jeez, Disney, you clearly know who your periphery demographic's gonna be, so maybe talk with someone who makes fursuits for a living? They know what makes anthropomorphic animals aesthetically pleasing, and could probably design all sorts of cool shit for the costumes- built-in cooling systems, blinking eyes, an articulated mouth, that kind of thing.", "Just saw this movie with little expectations. Absolutely loved every part of it, even the \"predictable\" twists of the story still played out in a creative way. I feel obligated to comment on this as to how it relates to a sequel. So if they're now partners, that would have to involve some cop/procedural/mystery-type plot. To fit in with the original's subtle/symbolic commentary on societal issues, the sequel's overarching mystery would likely have to include something like that as well. \n\nCombine all that with the growing relationship between the two main characters, the thing that jumped to mind was some form of kidnapping plot involving kids (maybe all predator, maybe all prey, maybe mixed) that also somehow ties in to the fact that Judy/Nick can't have them, interracial couples, adoptions/orphans, etc. Not sure if it'd be one high-priority kidnapping or systemic, but there are plenty of criminal/mystery plots that could be adapted to fit the world. Maybe one of them gets framed. Or they could just remake Chinatown.\n\nYou know what, the movie that just popped into my head is Gone Baby Gone.

I didn't associate her being called cute to women not being taken seriously because of their looks. Mind blown. I guess it also threw me off since, and I could be wrong about this, but wasn't the \"elephant\" in the room female? Though I guess even if she was, it's the stereotype of how women can't be \"feminine\" and do other things.\n\nAlso, I think the plight of taking the task of being a meter maid too seriously was another harsh truth.

Animation and art style was incredible, characters were well-fleshed out and some had good on-screen chemistry, plot was decent (actually got me in the end), some surprising adult themes and jokes were tackled too. I know its a Disney movie but I think it's fun to think about the world itself (maybe it's because I study biology). Some thoughts on that:\n\nDomestication doesn't seem to occur as there's no humans (although some of the pigs and sheep looked like domestic breeds, but it's hard to be sure). I know they really only showcased 'classic' mammals (and I'm impressed at the number shown) but I was also surprised at the lack of primates. Perhaps they removed primates completely in this universe so that humans weren't an option? \n\nOther thoughts include the ecosystems in Zootopia: there's meant to be twelve and we got to see 3-4. I wonder if there's a coastal ecosystem for our marine mammal friends, and a cave ecosystem for bats? I also found it interesting that the town outside of Zootopia seem more afraid of predators (since Zootopia was created for predators and prey to live in peace). Do rural areas differ in predation? \n\nWhat do predators eat? They've got a lot of human-based foods obviously but there's a bit of talk about predation being in the 'biology,' so carnivores would have to satisfy that in some way. Maybe they make meat substitutes in Zootopia? Not impossible!\n\nFinally, how do the other major animal groups play into this (fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates)? We could see flies and a fish market were in the movie, so they exist, but are they 'sentient?' Do these groups have their own Utopias? What would happen if these Utopias met? How would the predation hierarchy shift?\n\nGoodness this movie was done so well and so fun to think about. Left wanting more from the world and some of the characters too. Lots of potential to explore, would be cool if they brought out an Ecyclopedia or something. \n", "Finally saw it. Great film. Great, great film. ", "I'm 20. Just took my 12yr old nephew to the movie today. Spoiler Alert: It was awesome! Can't wait for 2.

The metahumor/references were also the only real funny thing to the point of feeling forced.", "I absolutely adored this movie. I went into it thinking the previews only looked decent, and it would be sort of a middle-of-the-line Disney movie, but I went to see it because I love Disney movies. I came out surprised at how it was probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile (along with Deadpool, go figure) and how smart and adult-directed the jokes and messages were.\n\nEveryone keeps talking about how the theme was specifically race relations and prejudice, but I thought there might have also been some symbolism regarding mental health issues with the savagery of the animals and it being \"biologically ingrained\" in their DNA. Just my take.\n\nI'm also really glad that they didn't pair Nick and Judy as a romantic couple. I had some fear they were going to go for the tried trope of the two eventually falling in love, and I thought the movie was much, much better for them having not done that.\n\nThe movie also had probably some of the prettiest and most amazing imagery I've seen in any Disney movie. They truly did an incredible job setting up the backdrop and the world.\n\nAlso, I feel like a sequel is inevitable. The way they set up the ending, it seems like it just begging to be continued.\n\nBesides all those points though, I think everyone else here has touched on everything else I was thinking.

Should have known there would have been a twist, having seen Frozen, Wreck It Ralph and Big Hero 6. Tangled kind of did. I think of those movies, this movie has the best potential for a sequel. I feel like that world could be explored even further. Although, I'm sure Frozen 2 will be the first to get a sequel if it hasn't been announced already.\n\nOnly thing I had a problem with is why did they make the fat police guy a cheetah? I thought maybe we would see a montage of him getting in shape. ", "This was byfar the greatest animated movie I have seen in years. This movie had some serious balls. They tackled race and stereotyping so perfectly. Also they released this at the perfect time, especially when we have jackasses like Donald Trump running for president\n\nSide note, that breaking bad reference was great. ", "NO ICING ON MY WEDDING :(", "Man, what a great movie. Like one of the reviewers said, it's so well made that you forget that it's animated and I can't agree more. I always had a slight problem with most animated movies in that they are usually so fast paced and so low on actual plot/story that they usually feel like just bigger episodes of your regular cartoons. Zootopia, on the other hand, works as a good film.\n\nI've been hyped for this movie since early 2013, when it was just announced and never have I ever thought it's gonna be this good. I loved everything about it and it pretty much sets the new bar of quality of both visuals and storytelling in animation. I really like WDAS' previous cgi movies, like BH6, Frozen, Tangled and such, but they feel like slightly awkward tries and experiments, with Zootopia being a product of all that effort, a finally realized potential.\n\nThe thing that bummed me down most after watching this movie is returning to a bleak real world. Zootopia is just a beautiful place and it's realized brilliantly. The worldbuilding is just insane, I'd love to just go through the movie frame by frame and see everything, that's how detailed it is. I wish the movie stopped more often and just allowed us to look around more. All this seriously reminded me of Avatar with its Pandora, the place that makes the real world just look boring.\n\nI adore both main characters. Judy is instantly likeable and Nick, while being an embodiment of a stereotypical \"sly fox\" is great, too. Charming rogue and an underdog are my favorite types of character because of how relatable and interesting they are. Couldn't get enough of these two. Especially Judy, she's cute and a great role model. I think she'll be everybody's favorite, but Nick is no supporting character either.\n\nThe story was pretty simple, it pretty much hits every checkbox as far as buddycop movies go. Still, it was done nicely and kept the pace going, plus I didn't expect some of the twists and turns, it was widly (heh) entertaining, especially because this type of story naturally allows for a lot of travel and this just couldn't work better for this beautiful city. The timeless message of prejudice and such were handled very well and the perspective of animals on all of this is fresh and fascinating. It was pretty heartbreaking at times, too.\n\nVisuals were just so, so good. I thought The Good Dinosaur and Big Hero 6 looked splendid, but neither had creativity or visual splendor and variety of Zootopia. The scene with Judy arriving on a train is just breathtaking. The music by Michael Giacchino wasn't especially noticeable, but it worked as a score well enough, I should give it a listen outside of the movie. Try Everything by Shakira is great and works awesome as an intro and ending.\n\nAnyway, now I want to see more adventures of Nick and Judy in this city and I hope this movie will be successful enough to make a sequel happen. Disney's been on the roll since Tangled and I think their movies now are better than ever and Zootopia sits on top of this food chain :) Now I just hope that Moana will be at least half as good. The only thing I didn't like as much is Russian dub. It worked well for the most part, but sometimes the emotions of voices didn't match well to the facial expressions and some text, like billboards and such, was translated but not all of it and can appear translated in one scene and in English in another. I probably need to watch it few more times to formulate a proper opinion, but I can't really say anything bad about it. It's everything I expected it to be and more.\n\nTL;DR Loved it a lot, will watch it again.\n\ncome visit /r/zootopia", "I LOVED it. It hit on all cylinders for me. Two things stood out - I was very impressed that Disney was able to address the racial divide (and bigotry in general) in such a natural way, so that everyone could understand it. There's plenty of grown adults out there who don't understand privilege and opression, so anything that can break it down for kids is great in my book. Second, it seemed to be made in the spirit of the Disney Afternoon cartoons - DuckTales, TaleSpin, Rescue Rangers, etc. Disney hasn't gone to that well in a while, so it was gratifying.

The etchings and the hilt are clearly not the same.

SoD had a lot of strange things like the slow motion, the ice shard kicking, and quickly strained faces that was unexpected and comical.

Remember when movies tried to be different and tried to make something you've never seen before instead of the same shit re-hashed over and over again? REMEMBER THAT? I do. I grew up watching movies that tried to be ballsy. This movie reminded me of that time in my life. when films were fun for the sake of being fun. They didn't take themselves super seriously, they tried to make your imagination wonder and show you a spectacle for a few hours. \n\nI just watched this film and I have to ask to all you reviewers...\n\nWhat's the fucking problem? The movie was fine. In fact, it tried to do something original. Isn't that the idea of films? I enjoyed this movie because it took a concept we haven't seen touched on and went all-out with it. It played a risky game. I really liked it. I've never seen a movie that's tried to create so many crazy scenes and landscapes before. Gods fighting demons. The underworld. Gods fighting other gods. Seriously, what's the fucking problem? I feel like people just hate to hate and don't really have their own opinion on films. It's sort of pathetic. \n\nThis movie is an adventure fantasy. WTF is the problem?! The script was fine. It was a simple concept of a god stripped of his power and the land overtaken by an evil god and it's his story of regaining his power, learning what it is to be human and what it is to be a god and restoring balance. WTF is the problem, people? seriously?! \n\nIt was a spectacle. I've always been fascinated by the idea of Egypt and their myths. To finally see a movie take those elements and go batshit crazy with it was AWESOME. It's a movie. It knew exactly how serious it should take itself and it had a lot of fun with itself. It showed us the underworld, all these bad ass gods and these crazy monsters and powers. It's exactly what I expected and I loved every second of it. The acting was fine. The actors and actresses knew exactly what movie they were in and acted accordingly. It was like Aladdin meets Clash of the Titans. \n\nEveryone complains about not having egyptians? The movie didn't even take place in a historically accurate Egypt. The fucking world was flat for christs sake. There were GODS blowing shit up. This place was not Earth, it was a fantasy world that only consisted of Egypt. Seriously, what the fuck is the problem? You should have known what kind of movie it was from the trailer. You chew popcorn and you enjoy the crazy shit. \n\nIt was a lot of fun to watch. The judgement scene when you either go to a heaven-like place or a hell-like place was bad ass. Anyone who's wondered what mythological Egypt would have looked like, what it would be like will enjoy the fuck out of this movie, because that's what it is. It's \"Egypt\" at the height of its power, as if all the myths were true. The CGI is awesome. HUGE lands of crazy-looking Egyptian buildings and statues with powers that can't really exists. Giant gods walking the Earth. Ra fighting the darkness demon that comes every night and he protects the realm by defeating it. It's so cool. It's a lot of fun. Stop trying to look for historically accurate depictions of a movie that doesn't even take place on Earth. Okay? Okay. \n\nI want to see this movie again just to enjoy the spectacle. Kids will love this movie as well. No curse words, some violence but it's no worse than Aladdin. The magical elements are exciting and it's just fun. It's a fun movie.

There were also odd logic holes, like, \"If that lady can control anybody with her eyes, why is she even trapped in this cage?\" or \"why doesn't she just take off her wristband?\". There were creative decisions in the script that just rested on the hope that audiences were willing to suspend their disbelief beyond what the premise required. For example, why was the main character just carried into outer space unharmed. Sure, the movie isn't trying to portray anything faithfully, but why add an extra hurdle for our suspension of disbelief? Lastly, the script characterized everyone the exact same way. Each and every character was the type of person to stop EVERYTHING they were doing, no matter how dangerous or crucial it was, just to give a (not so) clever one-liner to the audience. Characters speaking these one-liners to themselves with no context of WHY they are speaking aloud feels cheap because EVERYONE did this.

He defects from his church for its perceived decadence, and in trying to prove his piousness only proves his pride, hubris, and hypocrisy by not only shifting the blame for his sins to his eldest daughter but also indirectly hurting his family by refusing to go back to town a beggar even when it becomes abundantly clear that they shouldn't be there. The movie even tricked me into seeing him as this pious, noble person until the eldest daughter calls him out on his bullshit, which I thought was really clever. I feel like the takeaway from that is that there's nothing quite as prideful as thinking you are more holy and closer to god then everybody else. It's very fitting that one of the first scenes has him telling his family to kneel in prayer right in front of the satanic tree altar from the final shot of the film.", "Oh god that raven ", "This is one of those rare horror movies where the ending didn't suck. In fact it was my favorite part! \n\nNo fade to black without any resolution. \nNo dumb twist where the daughter or mother ended up being the witch. \nNo cheap jump scare. \n\n", "Those Early American Lit and Sunday School classes finally came in handy.

Too bad there were a couple morons in the audience laughing out loud during some scenes.  ", "For anyone who saw this at Sundance last year, did they change anything?", "Did anyone else pick up on allusions to classic fairy tales (Grimm and otherwise)?  Some that I noticed:\n\n* Rapunzel - daughter locked away by an angry parent, going inside with her hair conservatively tucked away, emerging with long, flowing golden hair\n* Red Riding Hood - a twisted version; in this case, the seductress in the bright red cloak is  the 'big bad wolf' (the witch) in disguise\n* Hansel and Gretel - young twins become involved in the affairs of a witch in the woods\n* The Three Little Pigs - the three children hide in the shed until the Big Bad Wolf (again, here it's the witch) comes to destroy it\n\nI'm sure there are more.  I think these stories are ingrained in our collective psyches and this film did a wonderful job of teasing them out.", "What dost thou want?", "Caleb just wanted to see some titties :(", "I honestly think that the final sequence with Black Phillip will go down as an iconic horror sequence.

Fuck im still shivering", "I liked the movie a lot. \n\nScore, visuals, atmosphere, and performances were all great. \n\nOne thing that I haven't seen touched on that made a big impression on me was how well the character of William was handled. Going in I thought that he would be a patriarchal tyrant and something of a monster himself. The movie went a much more interesting route with his character though. Though harsh at times (mainly just when he began to lose his mind late in the film) he was for the most part kind to his family. Rather than cruelty, it was arrogance and weakness that were his negative traits and his downfall. \n\nHis arrogance was what got his family exiled and his fear of being seen as a failure kept him from going for help. Even within his family, he was so afraid of seeming like a failure to his wife that he kept secrets that led to the family growing suspicious of one another. \n\nI think it says a lot about just how insecure he is that the angriest we see him get at Thomasin is not when he thinks she is a witch, but when she points out what a failure he is at farming and hunting. Interesting and tragic character. ", "Watching this movie was a similar experience to seeing the Revenant for me- it was light on story, but heavy on atmosphere and visuals.\n\nThe scene where the boy walks up to the witch's den scared the shit out of me. ", "I think we need to have an internal debate about what we define as scary. I've seen a lot people complain about the Bobadook, It Follows...and now The Witch, as films that didn't scare them. When people are pressed on this, they say it didn't make them scream or make their heart rate instantly jump.\n\nProblem is, I think a lot of people are mixing being startled, and being scared? Or maybe being startled is an aspect of being scared. However, being startled isn't always tied to horror. You could be sitting at our computer with headphones on, and if something fell behind you and made a loud noise - you would be startled. It's the sudden loud noise and crash behind you.\n\nJump scares are often that. Really loud noises, or aggressive images that interrupt a scene that startle you. I'm not 100% against jump scares, I think they can be a useful tool in the greater context of a film if used cleverly. But I'm not the biggest fan of how they are mostly used.\n\nPoint is, horror for some people (inducing myself), is being unnerved. It's getting chills, or having your skin crawl. The Witch IMO 100% does this for me (if it doesn't for some, that's perfectly valid). I personally have witnessed death or have seen scary things. And IMO it was never me screaming or a jumping out of my seat feeling.\n\n\nI feel like that is more closer to an adrenaline rush, a feeling you get when going on a roller coaster, or a ride that drops you from extremely high heights. In those cases, your senses are becoming startled (not the same as regularly being startled, as that often has an element of surprise. Although not always. IMO being startled is a disruption of the senses, and can be achieved even if you know something is probably going to happen. Which is why I'm comparing jump scares or roller coasters).\n\nThose things aren't scary or horror to me. Those are forms of adrenaline rush. And it's perfectly valid to enjoy that feeling (it's a big reason people seek out roller coasters, sky diving, or doing extreme things to trigger the feeling). So in that sense, I get why people love that experience - but in movie form. And I suppose the horror genre lends itself perfectly for it.\n\nBut that's still personally, not horror to me, personally. What is scary and horror to me, is being unnerved to the point that I feel disturbed and uncomfortable. Where I can't get an image or moment out of my head. It's when, everything I think should be right, is undermined and it makes you feel helpless and like things are actually worse then how things usually are. It's being outside at night, and the atmosphere (both the lighting and sound) - plus your fears that something might happen to you, start to shake you up.\n\nI'm only a 28 girl, so I'm not exactly old school. But I do tend to relate to classic horror films, or the Hitchock philosophy of what is scary. But I feel more and more, people don't relate to this. Maybe apart of that is people becoming more and more decensitized (I know that's happened to me. That's why Gore rarely effects me in film, although if done right, it can still unnerve me and make me uncomfortable). But I don't think that's impacted atmosphere for me. I still feel mood and atmosphere can unnerve me, and I feel that's closer to horror and being scary, then being startled is.\n\nAll this said, I don't want to lump everyone together. I don't want it to come off as, everyone only wants to be startled. What is horror and scary for them, might be completely different. But I personally feel movies like the Witch, get closer to what I feel is actual horror and what is scary. It's closer to what I actually feel in real life.", "DID THEY PULVERIZE THE BABY!! ", "Just got back from seeing this and, while it wasn't as outright scary as I thought, it was really, really unsettling. I've never really seen a horror film that felt so downright evil. \n\nAlso, I got the distinct feeling during the film that, while I was watching one movie, another one was slipping by unnoticed. Parts of it felt dreamlike and allegorical. I walked out of the theater feeling hollow, unsure of what to think. I really, really want to see it again. ", "I've been looking forward to this movie for about half a year now, so I've had all this time to think about what it was gonna be. It wasn't anything like that. And that's not a bad thing!

I was surprised at how little of the Witch we actually saw. There were times when it felt like more of a family drama than a horror movie. But it totally payed off in the end. The slow burn factor was really effective here. I have so many questions! What happened to the twins? What happened to the oldest Witch? My guess is that she's old and experienced in tearing families apart, and that could be what she'd done for all those other  girls at the end. Maybe Thomasin was just another addition to the coven, and that was the plan all along? Or maybe not. I don't know. What do y'all think?\n\n\nside note: that fucking Raven scene was probably the scariest thing in the movie. For me at least. I cringed so hard.", "It made witches scary for me.

They are clever, resourceful critters, but they give me the heebeejeebees in the worst way. As ashamed as I am to admit it, this is the *only* reservation I have against seeing the film, but it's a big one for me. I saw the goats in the trailer, and I am concerned that they will be a major feature of the film. Is this concern justified? And I obviously don't mind spoilers! I just need to know if I'll be closing my eyes through 2/3rds of the film. I've been waiting soooo long for this, but the new trailers have got me spooked due to the damn goats.

The focus isn't on the witch herself, but the tragedy that befalls on this family.\n\nOn the other side, it's an origin story of how one girl was pushed so far from the one's she loved that she said, \"Fucketh it\" and gave her life to evil.", "Does anyone else not know how they feel about this?

I didn't think it was particularly \"scary,\" but hours after getting home last night I was still thinking about it and getting a pit of anxiety in my gut.

It was so unsettling. \n\nChrist I need to both never see this again and see it again at the same time. ", "Can't really describe how horrifying and strangely beautiful this film was. The audience I saw it with watched the screen with an unholy reverence, stumbling out in silence as the credits rolled. Undoubtedly scary, but it's more than a thrill machine. Tight editing, a jangling score, and committed performances raise a great story into a classic horror drama, showcasing the collapse of a family after being terrorized by a sinister force. I felt like I just witnessed something that I've never seen before, and that's bold praise for horror considering that most of the genre these days is made up of 80s pastiche. \n\nBlack Phillip for president. ", "I don't have a clue what the response to this will be, but I am a Christian. Not only that, but I am a Reformed Christian, whose roots are found partially in the Puritan tradition. As such, I must say that I was profoundly pleased by *The Witch's* portrayal not just of Puritans, but of Christianity proper. I interpreted the movie in part as an examination of faith and the failure to live up to it, which spoke to me beautifully. I thought that this film finally did justice to what being a (sincere) Christian can be like: the desire to appear confident and holy when all the time you're riddled with doubt, and the inescapable hypocrisy we Christians are guilty of as we fail to live out our convictions. In other words, \"it's complicated.\" No \"God's Not Dead\" nonsense here- being a Christian is a losing battle in which we refuse to give up, and to which I thought this film stayed true. And I'm thankful for that. ", "One take that might be completely wrong but - after sleeping on it I kinda saw the following:\n\n* The opening scene is not a metaphor: the child is taken from the family by a Witch.\n\n* As the film progresses there are signals to suggest that William facilitated the child\u2019s theft as a sacrifice. I believe William has become aware of what lurks in the woods and in order to stave off a greater evil (ostensibly because their crop yield was thin), he has decided that a newborn was fair game.\n\n* Note that Caleb was told by his Father, William, to never enter the woods. In my mind this isn\u2019t William\u2019s fatherly-instinct at work but implies that he knows more than he\u2019s letting on.\n\n* At one point in the film, William half-heartedly confronts Thomison and asks for a demonstration of her piety. It\u2019s not convincing, whatsoever, that he believes she\u2019s actually a Witch. Watch his face closely\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can see the regret and insincerity.\n\n* This self-loathing and regret is further-validated moments later where William is found consoling, soothing (and grieving?) with Thomison; he\u2019s well aware of what\u2019s actually happening.\n\n* Note that Black Phillip appears on the property\u200a\u2014\u200ahe is not part of the family\u2019s livestock; I also believe Black Phillip might have shown up when Thomison gets her period (it was hard to parse the dialog throughout the film but the timing is mostly there.)\n\n* The silver cup has been, I believe, \u201ctraded\u201d (by William) for a trap/supplies. This is either a red herring or an indication that William is further placating something evil; perhaps the baby wasn\u2019t enough and a second \u2018prize\u2019 was called for. If you told me that a coven of Witches needed a silver cup I\u2019d believe it.\n\n* The silver cup shows up later in the film (at least I swear I saw it) when we find Katherine breast-feeding her missing newborn or, rather, a crow. The cup returning here is just a nod to the fact that it\u2019s not located far off-site and it has returned, along with evil made flesh, to the property.\n\n* I believe William knows that hell (Satan incarnate) is coming for his children\u200a\u2014\u200aspecifically Thomison. He does his best to protect her by boarding the children into the lean-to/barn. I don\u2019t believe William is aware that Black Phillip is Satan at this point; this of course all goes horribly awry.\n\n* Moments later, Black Phillip attacks and ends William\u2019s life. Once again the look on William\u2019s face is a tell: this is not surprise or confusion but is a realization.\n\n* I believe Black Phillip is constantly at work in the family through the youngest children. he uses them to seed discontent & distrust in the family\u200a\u2014\u200aultimately driving the family apart (quite literally\u200a\u2014\u200aThomison is boarded up in the barn); once the family is separated Black Phillip does his work either himself or through his coven.\n* Black Phillip asks Thomison to write her name into a book; I\u2019m not sure that I recall Satan having a book akin to the \u201cLamb\u2019s Book of Life\u201d but perhaps he does.\n\n* Thomison, alone in the woods, accepts her fate (gleefully I would add - she's fine with this) and joins the coven. Black Phillip has done his work. May God have mercy on her soul.\n\n* Note that it\u2019s entirely possible that Black Phillip is subservient to the coven\u200a\u2014\u200ajust a recruiting device of their choosing but the presence of that book and the promises he whispers leads me to believe that he\u2019s the active organizer here.\n\n", "Got out of a screening not 30 minutes ago. Definitely the best movie I've seen this year, and definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Their attention to the period in which it was set added plenty of efficacy to the atmosphere.

I will have nightmares tonight.", "Much like It Follows or The Babadook I have a feeling this film will get the \"it's not scary, so it sucks\" tag attached to it which is so unfortunate. While it isn't scary much like those other films it is far more unsettling. It reminds me a lot of The Shining in the way it starts of just slight off-kilter and then keeps descending and descending down these rabbit holes of visual poetry. It's incredible to me that a first time feature director would have such a way with visual horror like this. Some scenes, especially of the crow eating the mother's breasts, will haunt my sleep. It's just got this unnerving tone that it sticks to perfectly and never sacrifices for cheap scares. It shows a level of confidence that not enough horror films have. I deeply love how authentic it felt to the time and folklore. You can tell Eggers did his homework and it pays off, even if I could only understand 60% of the dialogue. My only minor gripe was I felt the characters weren't fleshed out enough pre-baby murder and I don't quite like the reveal of Black Phillip at the end. Still this is the kind of horror I love, simple with a consistent tone that leaves just enough disturbing images in your mind to keep you unsettled long after you've left the theater. \n\nI'll add, if you haven't see it check out the film [Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMN3i4tUy8M). It's a silent film that also focuses on more historical depictions of witchcraft very effectively. I'd be shocked if Eggers doesn't count it as an influence. Probably the goriest silent film I know too.", "[deleted]", "This movie captured the essence of horror even though it may not have been the scariest.

And that's not necessarily a bad thing in a movie, except everyone was like \"HAUNTING\" and \"UNFORGETTABLE\" and \"THIS MOVIE SCARED STEVEN KING YOU GUYS\" and I just didn't see that. I freely admit that this is just my opinion, though.\n\nI think maybe the marketing team would have done better to portray the movie as an uneasy, slow-burning drama about religious hysteria about witches instead of a really scary movie, because if that had happened, I would've felt less betrayed.\n\nAlso? As others have said, the dialogue is almost unintelligible sometimes.

I really cannot think of a moment where  a character did something that simply made no sense for them.   It had a lot to say as well.    \nA bit off-topic, but I think the accents and dialogue were quite easy to understand and was surprised when I found it to be so, considering all the people who were saying it was difficult.  The only times I had trouble making out what was being said was during Caleb's \"exorcism\" (what an amazing scene).    \nThe ending also felt...right. I felt like cheering when I saw her slowly rise, exulting in the power.  It was such a natural progression  and a grand victory for her that I couldn't help be happy for her, which is insane considering how incredibly horrifying the final act was.    \nThe acting was terrific, with Thomasin and Will being my standouts. Everyone else was excellent but these two were on another level. I felt the imagery was a bit heavy at times, but besides that this was a fantastically directed movie.  The camerawork really made me feel like I was there, watching something evil unfold rather than watching a movie. The score? Amazing.  It never took me out of the movie and start going, \"Oh shit, something's about to happen\" (which is not always bad), but rather heightened the tension that was already present and helped push the given scene to the zenith of its potential.    \nAll in all, the more I think about this movie the more I want to go back and see it.

His death came because he didn't notice Black Phillip roll up on  him, much like how he couldn't keep watch on everything that was happening.    \n**Caleb:** Restraint. Rather, Caleb's lack of it was what led to his demise. His natural curiosity leads him to assault his father with questions of faith and of reality.  Because he cannot restrain himself he also winds up in the den of the witch.    \n**Catherine:** She says it herself--she's not close to Jesus and God as she once was.

Not the case with *The VVitch*- I've never found a movie so unsettling and disturbing that I also simultaneously loved- I honestly felt I was able to connect to the characters and feel the same stress and terror that was plaguing them throughout the movie. No stupid jump-scares either, or dumb cliches or twists- the movie was straight forward horror. Seriously, the scene with Caleb's exorcism was downright freaky, like you could absolutely feel the panic and terror that was striking them during it.

All of it was top notch.\n\nI do have a question, though (spoilers). It seems like a lot of reactions in this thread are praising it for its literalism (especially the ending with Black Philip and the fire levitation). I'm not an expert on the subject, but I've heard that during the Salem Witch Trials and other cases of Satan worship accusations that a lot of it was due to people consuming food that was rotten. The food ended up poisoning people and caused them to hallucinate imagery typically associated with witchcraft. \n\nI couldn't help but notice that all of the corn they were harvesting was black and molding. Almost every shot in the house featured the molding corn in one way or another. My reaction to the film was that the family were hallucinating the evil presence, which was heightened from their religious paranoia. This doesn't really explain the first appearance of the witch in the woods mashing the baby in the full moon (unless it's a projection of their deepest fears?). Also, the final sequence in the film takes place immediately following Thomasin resting her head against the table, which I took to mean the fire levitation was a dream or fantasy. \n\nWhat did you folks think? Either way, be it hallucinations or Satan, The Witch has my vote as one of the best horror films I've seen in years. ", "The Witch is probably best horror movie in the last few years. Robert Eggers really gets what it means to make a horror film about Witchcraft. \n\nThis movie is not your routine jump-scare movie. With the exception of one or maybe two scenes, there are no cheap jump scares. So if you enjoy jump-scares, you will be very disappointed. \n\nVery few movies have exploited the topic of Witchcraft with such finesse. Eggers  builds up the tension layer-by-layer leading to a befitting climax. The cinematography included a lot of low-light shots which appeared to be done with just practical lights. Also deserving mention are the slow dolly zoom shots. But the movie's true character comes from its costumes, the careful recreation of the Jacobean era, and the strong plot. \n\nOverall, The Witch is a very well written and executed horror movie. It rightfully claims its place among the good horror movies ever made. ", "Apparently I'm the only one who thought this wasn't a horror story, but one of retribution and liberation.  Black Phillip isn't evil - he systematically frees Thomasin from the bonds of her terrible family.  In the end, she chooses her freedom of her own volition, and blissfully ascends into the darkness.  This is an incredible story of Satanic empowerment, where the evil presented is not the witch or the devil, but instead the embodiment of Christian tyranny.", "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with how grossly positive this thread is relative to this film. \n\nMy friend *hated* it. \n\nI didn't hate it, but I certainly wasn't blown away.

I'm not saying this was a bad movie, I'm just going to nitpick:\n\n* the climax is the dumbest plan of any villain I can recall off the top of my head in movies. Like it was dumber than monologue-ing your whole scheme to the captured hero, or dumber than expecting a captured hero to die unseen in a needlessly complicated death trap. So he knows Deadpool is nearly unkillable by conventional means, sets a trap and has all the advantages of choosing the time and location of the battle. He even acknowledges that to kill Deadpool \"there has to be nothing left to heal\". SO what does he do? He goes all out and... hires a handful of faceless goons to line up like some kind of 19th century firing squad and shoot at a guy that heal near-instantly? No bombs? No flamethrowers? Nothing that could impair his movement even? You couldn't even get an acme cage to fall on him? They just lined up and shot at him. I mean, the action sequences were great but that was one lazy ass set up. \n\n* I loved Colossus in this movie, he had great presence, and he finally got to be a bit of badass... but his role was ultimately simplistic and it's always a bit of a bummer when they use tough characters like him just to show how tough a bad guy is like they did when she throws her first punch and sends him flying (again, not a huge deal, just a little nit-pick)\nAlso, his role was one of those points in the plot that didn't in any way take away from my enjoyment of the movie, but didn't actually make logical sense. Logically speaking, Deadpool was a mercenary with a spotty record going on a straight up murderous rampage. He wasn't just killing people in the midst of a life or death firefight (especially since he can't really be hurt), he was actually murdering people with god knows how many innocents getting caught in the crossfire, and straight up executed an unarmed person at the end. In spite of all this, the big boy scout wants him to be X-Man? No, he's a straight up psychotic villain on a rampage that needs to be stopped (logically speaking).\n\n* Breaking the 4th wall is not in and of itself clever or funny, rather it's a device that *can* be used to be clever or funny. This movie didn't make that distinction and some of felt very forced (like him acknowledging that he was breaking the fourth wall - that's not clever; it's not a substitute for an actual joke). \n\n* On the subject of humour, while most of the jokes were great a few were downright awful. As I commented elsewhere,  the \"Let's dance!\" \"No, Let's fight!\" line is probably going to be the cringiest line of any movie I see this year, and it happened right at the climax too.\n\nAnyways, I really enjoyed the movie, and I could do a longer list of the things I liked, but I just felt like opening a discussion about some of things that *didn't* work since everyone else only had nice things to say. \n\nedit: also if you'll forgive me for being **super** nitpicky: I'm not sure how I feel about Colossus's ludicrously cartoonish proportions. And how much money did they spend rendering him in CGI for every scene? Why not hire an actor to play him and just armor up for the fights? With the money saved they might have been able to use a *third* X-Man! (ok, not really but I'm still curious)\n\nedit 2: I love how many people are arguing that I and others must not \"get\" the character because it's normal for the character to break the fourth wall, or that we must be unfamiliar with the comics. First off, even if none of has have read comics, you shouldn't have to read the comics to enjoy the movie. But that's not really relevant because it's not that complicated. He breaks the fourth wall. That's great. But here's the rub: it can be a characters thing to tell jokes all the time, but if the jokes aren't funny then the fact that it's \"his thing\" doesn't make them funny. Similarly, just because it's a common gag for Deadpool to break talk to the audience doesn't mean that every application of it is automatically funny. You're not special because you \"get\" the character and I don't, your just missing my point. You can even just say that you disagree with me because you found something funny that I didn't: that's fine, humour is of course subjective. But it's not like the gag is going over my head... It's just not always funny.", "My favorite line of the movie was,\n\n\"You should probably go over there there and talk to him, I don't know it, it might further the plot\"", "I loved every minute of it.

The TV show on the watch, the references to the Sony/Marvel feud, and the obvious insults toward Origins's Deadpool and Reynolds's Green Lantern are going to be obscure in a few years, but they work really well now.\n\nPeople can say it'll age poorly. That makes sense. A good number of the jokes are meant for the people watching it right now (see above). But some of the jokes are just overall funny. \"I feel sorry for your wife\" has no particular reference and is going to be funny a few years from now too, as is the trailer quote \"I feel sorry for the guy who pressures her into prom sex\".\n\nI have no complaints about this movie. Reynolds was perfect as Deadpool. You could see how much he enjoyed playing the character on screen. One of the previous comments mentioned \"labor of love\" and I couldn't agree more. Besides the obvious personal investment in the movie, there were no extraneous side plots, I never felt like a scene was included to add length, and I genuinely enjoyed each character on screen. Everything that makes me annoyed at movies that would otherwise be amazing was excluded.\n\nA lot of movies try to add to the genre as an art form.

Also Josh Brolin on fucking point as always. \n\nI liked how the movie ended with feigned importance on the movie industry. As if the main conflict of the movie was whether or not Mannix should take the new job in aviation or keep his current job and somehow the movie concludes telling us that his job at the studio has some sort of divine intervention to it.

Hobbie as a John Wayne character, not very bright but always on the right side of things thanks to his simple good-ol'-boy outlook on life.

As a whole though, I had a lot of fun.  The scene with the religious leaders had me in stitches, and \"Would that it were so simple\" was amazing.", "Obviously, [spoilers].\n\nHail Ceasar! is titled such because it draws your attention to what Mannix actually accomplishes: the juxtaposition of the inspiration that actors can pull off with the blasphemy that surrounds it as seen most clearly in the movie within the movie, Hail Ceasar, when Baird delivers the anticipated speech at the foot of the cross. And the juxtaposition is made acute as he can't think of the end of the line: \"faith\" and explicit \"blasphemy\" ensues. \n\nMannix provides the ideal--at least so he thinks. The scenes in the Chinese restaurant, especially the lines by the Lockheed headhunter, show Mannix's dilemma: What is it that he is actually doing at his company? \"Would that it were so simple\" is repeated not just for comedic effect. I forget where exactly, but Mannix defends his profession saying that what he provides is what people need (in a good way). However, he realizes (conversation with his wife) that sometimes things work themselves out. He ponders this fact/temptation all the while doing his noble work. \n\nEnter the communists. If people weren't selfish, inept, or arrogant, then it would work--and work well. But the ineptitude of the submarine scene shows how all their work is not only for nothing but they are just as human as capitalists. This is in contrast to Mannix who, although dealing within the rules of a capitalist-dystopia--a veritable communist nightmare, succeeds (at least for him). E.g., Deanna's marriage, Baird's recovery, and the Thacker sisters put in their place.\n\nThe very first shot is of the image of the crucifix: a visual depiction of the godhead (or not, depending on the clergy-member or the Easter egg in the credits--if we may ironically call it an \"Easter\" egg). From then on, the divine image is deliberately absent. You never see Jesus' face--homage to Ben Hur as well. This concept is most clearly portrayed when the actor portraying Jesus on the cross is asked, \"Are you a principal or an extra?\"\n\nWhen we take all of these together, we realize that Mannix, a man of massive conscience, makes God his compass. The answers are not in economic (\"economics is not about money\"), political, or social ideologies like capitalism or communism but in God--which might be why \"simpleton\" Hobie (who is explicitly \"not an actor\") has all the answers (his insightful deus ex machina about the extras) and is the physical solution to Baird's kidnapping. In other words, it's never about the briefcase--in any of their films.\n\nAll that to say, the Coen brother's Hail Ceasar! was beautifully shot and cleverly told. But for me, it wasn't knit together well enough to make me want to do the work of subsequent viewings that it would take to catch everything they're spelling out. In the end, a movie has to be enjoyable in its own rights (which ironically is the point of the movie industry and Capitol pictures in the film). If a film is so hard to piece together then it's simply work and maybe we would be better off reading a philosophical memoir instead. Despite my love for films like Fargo, Big Lebowski, Intolerable Cruelty, and Burn After Reading I guess I'm just one more among the masses that is grateful that people like Mannix exist.", "Sad to say that I was a bit underwhelmed.

There are details here that boggle the mind, how did they dig up these little gems of cinema history? \n\n2) They manage to simultaneously lampoon the silliness of these films and also embed a deep admiration for them. In this way they are like the Studio Exec's character, bobbing between these worlds and pushing down these awful fires below the visible surface. These fires threaten the *very nature* & truth of the pictures they represent, it is up to our Noire hero to dreg through this underworld & still believe in the goodness of the industry. In these frivolous catastrophes we are stressed with Mannix, and yet cannot help but be in awe of the worlds & magic these studios conjure. There was a scene where he is framed next to a giant Roman Statue (only the legs though) Who made this and how? To Mannix, this awe is mundane, lost next to the fires that threaten their very existence.\n\n3) Like many Coen Brothers films, themes of meaning in a (probably) meaningless world are at the heart of the narrative. The question here is, \"If both the Studio job & the Lokheed job are essentially meaningless & without lasting legacy, is there something wrong in taking the easier of the two? Or is it the right thing to do the thing that feels slightly more right?\" the Coens masterfully tell this story without really telling it, and Baird's capture by the Communists still propels forward by putting forward an antagonist to Mannix's wholesome trust of the system. The Communists represent a different worldview, a mechanistic one where each of these stories are just cogs feeding a deeper machine. This is why Mannix is pushed to action when he hears Baird's rambling: this work is good work, even if it doesn't have any really effect. (The Lockheed job is the opposite: it isn't what he wants but it has the biggest effect ever as evidenced through mushroom cloud)\n\nMannix's come to Jesus moment is in tandem with Baird- the very embodiment of empty frivolousness, the perfect movie star- giving a speech that moves even the people behind the screen that understand the magic. \n\nTL:DR- At that same moment, Mannix understands that the huge sacrifices for idiotic Sisyphean tasks are worth it if it feels even slightly more \"right\".\n\nEdit: Words\n\nPS The best line of this movie is, \"I shouldn't wear scarves.\" The best sequence of the film seems superfluous, when Alden Ehrenreich performs amazing rope tricks next to his chauffeur.", "I not only heard Michael Cera as Jesus, but also Jesse Eisenberg as the one telling Hobie Doyle, he had to move sets (after a good quarter of an hour). Anyone else?\nI liked the movie. I'm glad the Coens do not want to engage in the overwhelming-cinema. A smooth, short and entertainingly funny movie, good for a couple of smiles. Just like cinema in the 50s was. I'm tired of record-breaking blockbusters every half a year. ", "Saw it on a plane-- prob. the best place you can see a movie like this. Really awesome, very light.\n\nObvious comparison is Big Lebowski in how in the end nothing mattered at all. Except for the studio chief realizing where he belongs. Which is probably the entire point.", "Really enjoyable all around. It's definitely disjointed and kind of all over the place, but every individual scene is hilarious in it's own right, and some of the sequences are just all around fantastic. Had a smile on my face the entire time.\n\nLoved the \"No Dames\" dance number, and the meeting with all the clergy.", "I loved it. I am not sure why people disliked it so much.", "[deleted]", "It seems like the general consensus on here is that it was either supremely well liked, or not at all. I know my opinion on the movie won't make people happy, but I had to walk out after an hour. I just couldn't get into it whatsoever, and was severely bored. I went with my two other friends and they left first, I tried to stick it out, but followed shortly after. \n\nSeparating the movie from the trailer (as most people are suggesting), I will say that yes, the trailer looked amazing. I went in with low expectations just in case, and I just did not like the direction the plot went. I will also say the costumes/set and look of the film was great, it just didn't hold my interest. ", "Saw it last night, hated it. This is actually the only movie the Coen Bros have made that I don't like. No drama, uninteresting characters, very little comedy, stories that go nowhere, scenes that stretch on too long with no real payoff, ect. I REALLY, REALLY wanted to like this movie, as I'm a huge Coen Bros fan, but there are very few redeeming qualities about this movie.", "I really enjoyed the movie. It's definitely lighter, fluffier fare for the Coen Bros. but I felt like it still had a lot of substance as far as their opinions on Hollywood and art of filmmaking. It feels like they're venting a lot of their frustrations with the movie business while also advocating the art form of filmmaking, and they're doing it with crazy characters, actors having fun in great performances and beautiful cinematography.\n\nWhereas Burn After Reading feels like a pure lark, intentionally devoid of moral substance and mocking the futility of everything, Hail Caesar feels really genuine and even occasionally sentimental, something I never thought I'd say about a Coen Bros. film.\n\nPeople are saying it lacks substance but really it's just lacking cynicism. It's a softer, kinder side of the Coens than we're used to seeing.", "Self-Reflexive Hollywood at it's absolute best.  The way they poked fun at so many of the era's themes was incredible.  I was also impressed with the fact that they made almost no effort to tie everything together into some forced story arc.  Very cerebral.", "To me, Hail Caesar was the modern equivalent to seeing a variety picture show. It was fun, filled with clever and different films within the film and was beautiful to look at. The movie was also good at playing with your emotions in seeing how much a character's in movie personality clashes with their actual one. 9/10", "Like a lot of Coen brothers movies the plot device (usually a briefcase) is used to push the movie along then summarily discarded. It's there way of not so subtely telling the audience the plot really doesn't matter to them. Their art to me is a study of character, time period, art, and satire. To really relish in their films is to learn let the plot go and focus nuance. I throughly enjoyed this movie and can't wait for more viewings. ", "SPOILERS!!!\n\nI liked the movie and I think I liked it because it was really fluffy, which the Coens don't usually do, but also as I realized it was fluffy, that there had to be more going on. This is what I've gotten thus far.\n\nIt was a story with just tons of parallels to help fill in the blanks. Hail Caesar, the film they are shooting if a basic backdrop for Eddie Mannix's. A few things that popped up for this idea were that in Hail Caesar, the main character never gets to see Caesar, his \"boss\", just as Eddie never actually sees his boss. Also the shot in which Attonicus (?) looks over Rome and says how beautiful it is, and soon after Eddie is sitting in his office with his beautiful \"Rome\" of Capitol Pictures laid out in a giant painting behind him. And both characters have a crisis of faith. Attonicus with the obvious Christianity and Eddie with Capitalism. The offers from Lockheed are quite enticing, and Eddie would be paid more from Lockheed with less hours, but still in the end finds that his purpose is in film making, even goes to talk to his boss at the end. Which I felt was funny because we get that title card in the dailies scene early on that the divine presence will be filled in later. And we never really see Christ, how we never really see Eddie's boss, both are the character's answers to the crisis, both we never see. I felt that it was funnier then for Eddie to have his crisis of faith talk with a priest, but it's about money, while Baird's character is dealing with the \"actual\" Christ, after having just dealt with money the entire time.\n\nBut there were other parallels too. Eddie's home life also was paralleled a bit in the studio, making the studio seem more like his family than his family. His actual children have a test coming up and playing baseball, which Eddie needs to get involved with. Eddie does nothing, and both children respectively actually do really well without his help. \"I guess that one just sort of took care of itself,\" he smirked while eating dinner. I felt like his children were paired with Hobie and DeeAnna, the youngest of the stars in the film as well. DeeAnna's problem of trying to get a husband seems like it's going to be a big issue, with a lot of legal handling and secrets, but then it just sort of takes care of itself, when she gets married to Joseph. And similarly, Hobie is being sort of forced into an awkward romantic pairing with someone he doesn't know and you'd think that a cowboy and latin dancer wouldn't get along and as an audience I was waiting for a trainwreck scene there, but it ends up working out really nicely and we see what could be a blossoming romance.\n\nThen there is the whole communism/ Capitalism/ Capitol/ Kapitol plot. Just another plot to showcase the parallels of Eddie and Baird. Eddie being pulled to Capitalism, while Baird is being pulled in Communism. They both seem to be swayed pretty heavily to the opposing side. When Eddie gets the gifts from Lockheed and puts them in his children's rooms, it seems like he is leaning that way. Just as Baird seems to get entrenched in the ideas of communism. In the end Eddie realizes he doesn't want the money and wants to just make pictures, and is able to also snap Baird out of his communistic brainwash. Funny that Eddie chooses Capitol instead of Capitalism. \n\nI think Eddie's wife is mirrored by Thora and Thessaly. The constant lies that Eddie tells, even though the lies to his wife are so minuscule they eat him up inside. But he still tries to be good to her, coming home for dinner in the middle of a kidnapping and all the other shenanigans. He tells Thora and Thessaly everything is fine when everything seems to be going haywire and almost seems like he doesn't like them, but also makes sure to give them enough information to write about and give them something. \n\nAnyway, I felt like it all still had that underlying feeling of dread to it, like a serious man had, but there was so much glitz and glamour it was hard to see. It felt like the universe was supposed to be our universe. Referencing actual events and even alluding to the fact that we got this story from uncovered documents that were sealed until 2015. So that means that Capitol Pictures goes under with the advent of television like the Lockheed man says. Eddie would lose his job and his ability to work for Lockheed, which we know as one of the most financially successful companies around today. Also, Baird's name gets put into a list of communists and makes a reference to the writers about \"naming names,\" and you can't help but think that when the blacklisting in Hollywood starts, Baird will be blacklisted. It seemed almost like the ending of A serious man, with the last shot being a shot up to the sky. In a serious man, the sky was filled with a coming tornado, but Hail Caesar was a radiantly bright skyline. Which gives the feeling of everything was great from that day forth, as many classic hollywood films ended, but in true Coen brothers fashion, those little tidbits of information of what is to come, makes the ending feel uneasy.", "The point of most films is to tell a story. Others seek only to explore a character. This was an example of the latter. We follow Brolin's character through his day to day. Crises spring up around him and he must handle them. He is given a chance to leave this hectic life for something by all accounts better and easier, yet he is reluctant. This film explores what gives a man purpose in life.\n\nFor those expecting serious resolution, you're going to be disappointed but I think that expectation misses the point. We see only enough of these crises to know the kind of shit Mannix deals with.\n\nThere are some weak points of course, but overall this film was funny and felt worthwhile as an analysis of the main character. ", "I was finally able to see it here in the UK and I absolutely loved it. A love letter to the Golden Age of Hollywood. I think one of the biggest reasons they made it was so they could do the water ballet, the cowboy stunts, the dance sequence,...  \nThe plot wasn't all there but it's the individual scenes and characters that make it shine.", "Every scene with Hobie was fantastic, but I wasn't so sure about the rest.\n\nI especially loved the scene with Hobie and Ralph Fiennes.", "The more I think about it the more I like it.\n\nThere's an old adage that Hollywood loves movies about Hollywood.  The reality is that Hollywood loves *Hollywood* movies about Hollywood. This is a movie that in typical Coen brothers postmodern fashion, is both a film and a comment on filmmaking.  Therefore, a negative or ambivalent reaction to it is a comment on the means of production, not just the production itself. \n\nIt plays with the notions of representation (the religious leader's commentary on the portrayal of Jesus in the film vs. the PA asking \"Todd\" if he gets a boxed or hot lunch or if he's a principal).\nIt plays with the notion of editing (loved Frances McDormand's editor). \n \nIt lays bare film making as an industry, exposing the treatment of actors as cogs, ready to be fit into or replaced, as you would a worker on an assembly line.

It followed Manix and his life, but it itself didn't really have a defined conflict or motive to the movie. It was a extremely well crafted, directed, acted, written ect (pretty much everything), but at the same time it didn't try to be a movie. The result in my opinion was complete lack of plot devices, and gave the movie a very real feeling.", "Using Roman emperors as a scale of quality I would say this film is no Augustus or Diocletian but it isn't a Caracalla or Commodus either. It was Tiberius, a decent thing that became increasingly worse as time went on.", "I thought it felt like a Wes Anderson movie as interpreted by the Coens.", "I thought it was a fun time.

What a great film. I went alone on valentines day (nothing sad about that!) to the Alamo Drafthouse, and I was laughing my ass off in the theatre.\n\nGreat film! I'm glad it was so good, because I really didn't enjoy \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" that much.", "I really liked the scene when the communists decide to not keep the $100,000 and give it back to Channing Tatum \"for the cause\" and he of course drops it in the ocean because his dog is more important to him than \"the cause\".

They pulled off the zany Hollywood characters perfectly.\n\nSee, the trailer for this movie made me want to see it so bad. The golden age of Hollywood, interrupted with a kidnapping, combined with a crazy cast and quick, coen-y humor seemed so perfect. Like a fun, crazy ride.\n\nAgain, movie absolutely nailed the period. Hollywood was frantic and the personalities in Hollywood were fun to watch. The problem is that it relied on its cute, beautiful setting entirely. \n\nIt took everything interesting about the story and made it dissatisfying, which I thought wouldn't happen with such a fun concept of a Hollywood star being kidnapped. I was waiting the entire time for the big, amazing, crazy conflict at the end with the communists and our main characters, but the movie just didn't do it.\n\nIt didn't nearly take advantage of the insane places a Hollywood kidnapping could go. Instead it just felt like a fun way to show the zaniness of the rise of film. It succeeded as a great showing of the setting, but the story didn't nearly reach the heights of where it could have gone to. It mostly felt like a bunch of scenes to show the weird, kinda funny Hollywood personalities. It did that well! But that's all it really did.", "One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.

Incredibly boring.", "Once again I come to /r/movies to leave disappointed with the movie's reception here. I know and appreciate everyone's point of view get as different as they come, but I personally loved the film.\n\nI like how subtle and natural the comedy was, not forced at all as the tendency in most of movies nowadays tend to be. I don't see any mention of the *joke* eagle sound every time \"On Wings as Eagles\" was mentioned throughout the movie, I laughed my ass off every time, very very subtle but hilarious nonetheless.\n\nOne complaint I have is the atrociously little amount of screen time Jonah Hill got, it was like 2 or 3 lines in total I believe? Where one was repeated, he's shown in the posters I saw about the movie, and I believe there's some joke about it in there that I'm not getting, but I'll be damned if I don't love Jonah Hill and I expected way more in this film.\n\nOnce again I apologize for the late comment, I live in a different country where these movies take a long time to get a showing, I saw it as soon as I could, I love the Coen bros and they didn't disappoint me this time either.

It references things like Busby Berkeley's dance numbers and Ben Hur so much.

The direction was equal parts bland and confused - the scene with the reporters outside of the studio seemed to go out of its way to mess its own visual message up. The thematic material didn't resonate through either the film's structure or its often muddled plot. It felt simultaneously rushed and padded.\n\nProps to the art department, sure - the period detail was nice enough, when it could shine through the often far too straight-laced cinematography (Roger Deakins must have had an off day). But it doesn't do enough to salvage the film from being a boring, core-less mess.\n\nEDIT: I think another big issue I had with it was that it didn't feel stylized enough.

Yes, the aspect ratio changed on occasion. Briefly. That in and of itself doesn't make a movie feel like something it's not. \n\nIn hindsight, I think the script may have some merit, (though I still don't buy elaborate Berkley-style swimming numbers as inherently funny) but the direction saps it of all life.

The actors as well are consistently good, too.\n\nOn the other hand, the whole thing feels way too unfocused to get any initial enjoyment out of it. The plot's introduced, only for it to drop anticlimactically by the end. The individual scenes are very good on they're own, but they distract from the overall flimsy plot, which makes it even more of a mess.

History is a science, we can predict the future, etc. (coming from a group of people who say they're interested in the benefit of the working man while staying in a beautiful beach house and complaining about not getting paid enough for the screenplays). Whitlock goes on to Mannix about how the studio is a pawn in a capitalist scheme and other random stuff, and Mannix grabs him, smacks him, and says something along the lines of \"you're just an actor, you're going to do your job as an actor, just like the director does his job, the caterer does his job, blah blah.\"\n\nSo to me, with all the other weird stuff going on with other characters in the studios' various projects, it's kind of a way of saying how crazy it is to try and put together a movie. Something the Coens undoubtedly have experienced at least a dozen times as directors and producers. Everybody has their role to play, everybody has a job, but they're all still people struggling with internal and external conflicts. This is basically what we see Mannix doing throughout the film: in addition to struggling with his own issues, he's trying to solve everybody else's and get movies made because that's his job as a studio fixer.\n\nI agree that the movie has a lot of random moments and scenes that basically don't amount to anything, and I understand someone if they say they don't like the movie for that reason. I just personally thought it was really funny and I think the random, jumpy nature of the plot actually makes a lot of sense in the context of the main character and overarching theme of his personal conflict in the movie", "When the credits rolled, the theater was dead silent.

Nothing is really what it looks like, nothing is literal. The communists are really communists, not Joe McCarthy's fever dream of American communism.

The date scene evolves *very* weirdly from genre to genre, ending in an earnest yet deeply satyrical sailor/spy picture.      \n\nI dunno...I was disappointed, but now I'm intrigued.

", "It wasn't as filled with madcap screwball humor or fast-talking hijinks as I'd hoped (I'm a huge fan of The Hudsucker Proxy) but it was still very good with lots of belly laughs and wry moments - I was grinning the whole time.\n\n\nI also thought it was actually a solid and very interesting blend of their old Norman Rockwell-themed misadventures and their newer quasi-existentialist material, like 'A Serious Man.' My only real problem is that it seems like a fair bit was cut, I'd love an extended version. \n\n\nAnd Channing Tatum just gets better with every appearance! His submarine farewell was almost better than the dance number. ", "I really enjoyed it. Of course it isn't No Country For Old Men, Fargo, or The Big Lebowski, but I thought it was good in its own way. The fake movies were very accurate, the acting was on point, and the story was interesting (although not perfect). It's definitely one of the Coen Brothers' weaker films, but a weak Coen Brothers film is still a damn good film, and I think with some time people will look back on it as a success that fits into their filmography quite nicely.", "I thought it was funny, but a little long, and actually boring in some spots. I have no idea what the point of Scarlett Johansson's sub-plot was. \n\nIf you've seen the trailer, then you've seen almost all the funny scenes.", "This film is an utter mess. The tone of the film is all over the place, the plot seems to be hashed together at the last second and is nonsensical, many of the characters seemed to serve no purpose, and every single joke fell flat. The Coen Brothers have truly disappointed me here.\n\nTo put my disdain for this movie in perspective, at least every weekend I see a movie and I've been doing so since last summer. *Hail, Caesar!* was the first movie that I genuinely disliked (though *Crimson Peak* came close)\n\nEdit: As I think about this film, it would've been a lot better as a TV Show. It would give each thing Mannix has to fix more time for us to actually care about them and less clutter of stories. Have Eddie Mannix and his assistant be the main characters and some recurring roles by Tilda Swinton and Mannix's family. It would solve many issues with the film. After that, the only issue would be to fix the part about the lack of any humor.", "I wanted to walk out. I was waiting for it to pick up a bit and maybe throw in a twist or something, but it never did. It lagged on and on and on. I shouldn't feel totally bored in a movie. I didn't feel any emotion for any of the characters, most of the characters are totally disposable and were pointless for the main plot, if you could even call it that. The acting I think was good but it should have been for a completely star studded cast. Most people either needed bigger roles, or none at all. I wanted more from almost everyone but that 'more' didn't show up. I have to say the trailer was 100 times better then the actual movie. Such a disappointment from the coen brothers. This movie can't hold a candle any of the greats. It barely quailifed as a comedy. Wasn't a drama. I still have no idea what I just watched.  ", "Honestly, I really hated everything that wasn't that dancing sailor scene.  The movie was bland, the \"symbolism\" was heavy handed and useless.  Basically, this was a really stretch of a movie smelling it's own farts.  I deeply regret having chosen it over Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.  \n\nAlso (aside) we caught it at a Movie Tavern and the quality there has taken a nose dive hard.  ", "I thought it wasn't that good honestly. I was upset at the beginning because some old man in the theater feel asleep and started snoring pretty loudly, but as the movie went on, I started to feel like he was more and more justified. I can see why they had to make the trailers misleading, it was so slow and nothing of any consequence happened.", "Somebody stood up and yelled \"It sucked!\" when the credits started rolling, and that made me laugh harder than any part in this movie. I felt punished for watching it, and the 1 hour 45 minute run time felt like 3 hours.\n\nHere's just a few things wrong with the film:\n\n* Under-utilization (bordering on waste) of talented actors. There were so many actors in the film that had minuscule performances that the trailer advertised to look like main character parts. Jonah Hill's entire performance was in the trailer. Same with Scarlett Johansson. If they were supposed to be cameos, don't put them in the trailer. Instead I felt cheated by having the big names I came to see in the movie not having more than 2 minutes of screen time.\n\n* Plot. The plot was literally The Big Lebowski without any of the twists that made it interesting. There was no conflict to make the film interesting. At no point in the movie did I feel any of the characters actions had any real repercussions. He got money to pay the ransom with, does he owe the money back to anyone? No. Our big actor got kidnapped, is there any risk of him being hurt? No. Two characters seem to be hitting it off well, will their relationship develop more? No.\n\n* The characters were not enjoyable. All of the supporting characters were too quirky to be relatable. I understand having wacky voices can be funny, but so many characters had them it felt I was watching a live action cartoon in a bad way. Josh Brolin as the main character was boring. He was such a normal guy that I didn't care for him. It was like watching a movie centered around an NPC.\n\n* The movie sequences were obviously the reason this film was made. If the Coen Brothers wanted us to watch these sequences they should have released them as short films instead of trying (poorly) to weave a story between them. Don't get me wrong, they were we'll filmed and fun, but I kept wanting to get past them while watching the movie. I wanted the plot to advance, but instead I would get another 5 minute mini movie sequence. If someone had showed me these mini movies on their own I would have loved them, but in the movie they just pissed me off.\n\n* Nothing happened. I don't care if this was \"the point\". I want there to be advancement, I want there to be drama. I got none of that. People in the theater were fucking pissed when the briefcase fell in the water. That was their only hope at a story and the directors threw it away for an unfunny joke.\n\nIn the end it's just not a good film. If you have to justify it being good by explaining how it has symbolic meaning and metaphors and homages and Hollywood in-jokes, that's fine, but that does not guide a movie. A movie needs to be entertaining on the base level and then can be stacked with symbolism and metaphors and all that jazz to be analyzable and interesting on a higher level. Hail, Caesar! was simply NOT entertaining. And I feel ripped off because the trailer made me believe I'd be watching a different film.\n\n**EDIT: Downvoting this is bad Rediquette. This post FURTHERS the discussion. If you don't agree with what I have to say at least explain why.**", "There are some decent chuckles, but I really was underwhelmed.  ", "Honestly, I am extremely underwhelmed and disappointed. I don't know what exactly it is about this film, but it just feels so hollow. There's no specific thing I disliked about it, but when it ended I thought to myself, \"That's it?\"\n\nI did have a few LOL's, but they were few and far between. And none of them were connected to the overall narrative. They were just small little one-off scenes, almost like skits on SNL.  \n\nI was hoping and wanting so much more out of this. ", "Personally, I really liked it. Like most Coen Brothers films, it is so chock full of contrasting ideas and nuances that you can read it in a variety of different ways. Like all the different religious figures sitting around the table, everybody will have their own take on this movie and what it's trying to say, what kind of meaning to take away from it, or whether it even had anything to say, or anything meaningful about it whatsoever. \n\nI definitely think that it had meaning and stuff to take away from it. I took away that the Coens are clearly raising questions about the whether film and Hollywood and acting is meaningful at all, or if the implication that those things are meaningful is just artsy people jerking themselves off and acting superior. The characters in this film are all genuinely talented, both in the film, and with regards to the real-life actors portraying those characters. But does all that talent working together really add up to stuff that means anything, big picture-wise? Or is it all just entertainment? Probably a bit of both, but how much of each? It's interesting. \n\nBecause obviously the Coen Brothers make films that have some kind of meaning to them. That's obvious. If they wanted to make straightforward entertainment, they could easily do so. But they focus on the little details of humanity. The side stories to the bigger picture. The little guys that are typically contrasted to dark, powerful, mysterious people who actually call the shots or make huge waves. They don't eschew the typical Hollywood formula just for laughs, or for any kind of simplistic axe-grinding purposes. I think they want to reveal things about humanity with their pictures, but want to avoid coming out with easy declarative answers to the complex nature of human existence. Their films rarely have an exciting climax that gives the audience exactly what it wants. Instead, they have a very thoughtful way of telling stories, and coming to conclusions that you won't see coming and you might not see the meaning of right away. \n\nThis movie has a lot of stuff to chew on. I just saw it tonight, and the more I think about it, the more I like it. It's not a masterpiece the likes of Fargo, Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men, Barton Fink, or A Serious Man. But it's a really funny movie that has a lot of stuff to think about, a lot of great characters, a lot of great dialogue, and I'll definitely revisit this film in the future. \n\nEDIT: I feel like I wrote a lot about the movie, and I didn't even get to talk about Alden Ehrenreich or the brilliance of Jonah Hill's character that's only in the movie for like a minute. I didn't even mention the communists, or Channing Tatum's song/dance number, or Scarlett Johanson, or Ralph Fiennes, or Josh Brolin, or Tilda Swinton's double performance. There is really so much stuff in this movie, and most of it is really great. ", "BORING", "I loved just about every scene in the movie. I was either laughing or appreciating the throwback to old school Hollywood. But as a whole I thought the story was lacking. Everything wrapped up so abruptly and without much consequence. But I think maybe the true meaning went over my head. I need to think on it some more and maybe watch it again when it comes out on video.", "Loved the movie, I could tell from the trailers there was heavy misdirection but, watching the trailer after seeing the movie I can't believe how blatant it is. Like they construct voiceover to hint at a plot that does very much not fucking exist.\n\nAgain, I loved the movie, but anyone who went in thinking Josh Brolin was going to assemble a super crew of Ralph Fiennes, Scarlet Jo, Jonah Hill, and Channing Tatum to rescue George Clooney is going to be super fucking disappointed.\n\nYou go in expecting nothing but a Coen Brothers movie, you're going to have a good time I think. \n\nEDIT: So looks like people don't like that this movie doesn't \"come together\" or that the characters don't matter or we don't get to know them. I don't know. My theater of mostly old people was laughing through the entire thing, and afterwards were like \"That was fun, unusual, but fun.\" I had fun, and I feel like I have some things to think about, and I'd really like to see it again. I feel like having seen Trumbo within the last two months makes this movie funnier somehow, just because it goes over the fucking top with Communism in the Film Industry. I mean, watching a big movie star jump from a small boat full of Hollywood writers onto a Russian submarine... there's something about that set against Trumbo that's really funny to me. I don't think you're supposed to care about Channing Tatum so much as just laugh at him, and isn't that alright? ", "Absolutely loved it. Not their best film overall, but I nearly cried laughing at points so I left happy. As far as a Coen comedy goes it was hugely successful in my opinion. Clooney describing communism to Brolin at the end fucking killed me. ", "To those who found it boring I completely understand but watching it in this perspective may change your mind.\nFunnily enough - in uni at the moment I'm studying Hollywood cinema. Every week we touch on a new topic about how the industry works in that time and basically explained the movie to make it more enjoyable.\n\n*I totally may be wrong but this is just my opinion and what I\u2019ve gathered from class*\n\n**SUPER BRIEFLY** in the first week of class we learned about Hollywood's 'star system' in which the film industry basically 'controlled' the public lives of their actors/actresses. Each actors and  actresses portray a significant type of persona as they would constantly be playing the same roles in order to sell and market the film efficiently. For example, modern celebrities you get Bruce Willis who plays the typical hardened action hero; Megan Fox as the super hot seductive teenager; Vin Diesel as.. you get the point. Now to keep that image up from screen to real life - the film industry tries to retain that image by essentially controlling what they should say or do in front of the press.\nIn one of the scenes, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is to fix the public image of DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johannson). We find that in films she's portrayed as this innocent virginal girl who's beautiful and charming girl. As she comes up out of the water and back into her seat we find that she's actually vulgar and nothing like her film persona. She has sex with multiple men and is pregnant with one of the many men she's slept with. Now to retain that image of the innocent virginal girl, Eddie's job is to find out a way to explain her pregnancy to the public without ruining her celebrity image. He then takes her to Joseph Silverman (Jonah Hill) to make up a plan but in the end she ends up getting with him and her public image is saved.\nTLDR; Eddie (Josh Brolin) has to save Deeannas\u2019 (Scarlett Johannson) public image because Hollywood controls how they\u2019re viewed outside of film screens.  ", "I went into this movie without much knowledge of who was in it or what it was about, having not seen any of the trailers for it. This is apparently a good thing, because unlike the people in this thread saying they're disappointed compared to what they expected, I was simply entertained.\n\nIt was great, and very funny. It felt like the Coen brothers at their most auteur, which was fun to see. I can't help but feel they were simultaneously trying to mimic Tarantino (with the focus on film) and Wes Anderson (with the style it was shot). Both are fine, because it ended up being entertaining throughout.\n\nOn the non-comedic side of things, I enjoyed the structure. It seemed to be set up as a series of vignettes about both the 50s and Hollywood, with Mannix (and Baird and Hobie, to lesser extents) serving as a bit of an audience surrogate on each section. I think this is especially obvious during Channing Tatum's musical number, where Mannix walks up and watches it being performed.", "I am reading all of these comments and I am a little hesitant to share my opinion but I thought it was kind of boring. I don't really watch Coen brother movies so I guess a lot of my complaints have the response, \"Well, that's a Coen bros. movie for ya!\" That's on me I guess for not knowing what to expect.\n\nI was just kind of confused at the whole thing. If all the side plots are supposed to be a metaphor that's fine but I just didn't catch them and I felt really lost. I laughed at a lot of parts, and thought some parts were *really* funny but I felt that each sub plot was its own movie almost and I just didn't understand how it connected.\n\nI want to like this movie and I want to see what everyone else is seeing in it, I really do, but I just don't.", "I wish people would rate films on what they are and not how well they stack up against what they expected. This was a lighthearted, authentic throwback movie, and people are disliking it because it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy. ", "Honestly it was probably the most boring film I have seen. Sure, great performances and everything else, but it was just boring. I felt like it was trying to convey some message, but I just wasn't feeling it. Also the quirky stuff felt more like it was ripped from Wes Anderson. ", "I'm surprised at how many people on here are shitting on the movie.  It's not one of the Coen's best but it was still a really enjoyable film.  Plus, Alden Ehrenreich is a real find.  He was the best part of the movie.  They should take Jonah Hill off the poster and replace him with Alden.  ", "This has to be one of the most boring movies ever. Maybe I'm missing something but it felt like the studio gave the Coen brothers a month to write the script and they waited until the last night to write it and submit it. The only funny part is the cowboy trying to act in the fancy movie other than that the movie had no point.", "I am a huge Coen Brothers fan, and have been waiting for this one for months. Wow, that was terrible. It seemed like such a haphazard mess lacking any coherent structure. How would you even describe the story? It was like little subsections of stories that don't tie together. The Clooney stuff felted almost like an aside, as opposed to the main story in all the trailers. The whole thing was essentially Brolin's character trying to decide on some job that I don't care about. And he decides that he'd rather make movies. Ok? Great. For like an hour and a half I didn't even know we were supposed to care about that. \n\nIt was the weakest writing I have ever seen from the Coens. First of all, how is an extra able to spike the drink in front of the entire cast and crew? The communist submarine was unbelievably dumb. Tatum being a communist came out of nowhere and didn't feel organic or authentic at all. The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. The narration added nothing. It was just a mess. \n\nThis is one of the biggest disappointments I've had in a while. Probably the worst Coen Brothers film I've ever seen. ", "This movie was bad. Really really terrible. The plot was razor thin.

Just the audience expecting to say, \"oh hey there's Scarlett Johansen, or oh hey there is Jonah Hill.\" Ralph Fiennes had 3 scenes, one of which was the only funny one in the entire film.\n\nI'm sorry guys and gals, minus the costume and set pieces, this film is a total waste of time.

MOJITOS FOR EVERYBODY!", "The movie wasn't good. Popular opinion in this thread seems to be that they enjoyed it for what is it and anyone who didn't, gets downvoted. I don't know what it is with TV shows making movies, but rarely do you see it work. What do we like about BMS? College partying with crude but witty humor, the conjoined football aspect, good looking women, drugs, and especially the unique and very memorable characters. You never  know what is going to exasporate out of thad's mouth; he pretty much makes the show (TV series). The plot was one dimensional. Save the house. Okay. The movie was pretty much filmed from one big scene at a party. Lazy writing? I don't know how much 1.5 mil works in a movies budget, but they sure had enough extras and props. The whole theme of the show felt forced into one big blender of a crap show. Dialogue just felt off compared to the quick and witty remarks in the actual show. Some character examples: Sammie's character is an eccentric weirdo. We get two scenes of him people watching while masterbating. Okay, we've seen this. The frontal shots were excessive and getting raped by Billy was just not needed. If you are a youtube user, you probably know who Jimmy Tatro is. His character is thad 2.0. He talks fast, wasnt memorable, feels off but fits right in with the style of characters in the show. You see Radon but never does he have dialogue. His acting career is farther than any other actor in the show currently and doesn't get any dialogue. Alright. He's a top 3 character of mine. This movie was highly wanted considering the kickstarter went so well. All in all, it puts the show to shame imo, just like what Entourage did this last summer. The show is an 8/10, the movie: 2/10.", "Just finished watching. I think fans will be entertained, and there's lots of really funny moments. The threesome scene in particular had me in stitches. Jimmy Tatro fit in seamlessly and I loved his Dick Dawg character. I also liked how they revived the Mary Jo/Alex storyline that had been built up pretty well in season 2 and then completely abandoned by the second half of season 3. \n\nSome of the bigger issues I had were how much screen time certain characters were given. Radon literally has like two lines and that's fucking unacceptable for one of the best characters in the entire series. He should have come in with some ultra cocky entrance and [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwlAEoMI3fE) blasting just like in his introduction in season 2. Instead he just randomly appears in a \"blink and you'll miss it\" scene. I also feel they missed a huge comedic opportunity for an interaction between him and Shiloh with some sort of reference to both guy's sudden disappearances at the end of seasons 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nUnless it was a throwaway line that I missed or something happened at the end of season 3 that I totally forgot, we never get any sort of explanation for why Denise Richards's character is missing. The sidestory with Coach Daniels was pretty weak and didn't do his character justice as well. The new dean character also didn't really do anything for me.\n\nThe ending felt rushed and, I know this is gonna sound weird, but unrealistic even by BMS's wacky standards. I think part of the reason I felt underwhelmed was because I thought the movie would serve as a definitive, proper end to the series we never got but instead it seems to be the intro to a series revival that the cast is hinting more and more heavily at. I'm on board, but it would've been nice if Falconer and Romanski had made that more clear during the promotion.\n\nFinally, and on an admittedly petty note, we didn't get to see Mary Jo's tits. IF WE HAVE TO SEE SAMMY'S DICK THAT MUCH, COULDN'T THEY HAVE AT LEAST GIVEN US THAT FOR A TRADEOFF? UGH.\n\nOverall, as a big fan of the original series, there was a lot to love here and I enjoyed it.

I don't know whether I have just out grew the show or it really was better during the series. It was nice to get closure on the characters. If they make a new season on Netflix they should bring in an entire new cast and start over. The premise is good but this story arc of characters has come to a close.

I am quite happy with the results. Almost all of the major things that made me LOVE the television show were all present in the film, so there is no way I wouldn't enjoy it. \n\nNow, if you haven't seen any BMS episodes, please do yourself a favor and watch two to four episodes so you get to know the characters a little better. There are a few quirks to this show that can be hard to embrace without a little exposure first lol. \n\nWith that said, let me explain why I already have plans to rewatch this direct-to-digital film multiple times this week: \n\n1) Harmon. Falconer and Romanski created an *incredible* character in Harmon, and to have him feature so prominently in this movie just felt right to me. (Also, I discovered through the cast vines that were sent out that his favorite episode was the Drug Test, which makes me love and appreciate the actor all the more). \n\n2) The soundtrack. One of my absolute favorite things about the series was the soundtrack for each episode. For me, the movie absolutely did the series justice on the music front. \n\n3) Sex and sexuality. Let me explain...I am utterly convinced that BMS is probably one of the most progressive, sex-positive shows to has ever been on television that wasn't a) melodramatic as fuck, or b) devoid of all humor. Honestly, this show embraced and celebrated a whole array of crazy sexploits, with little to no shaming of said sexploits. All of it was fairly shameless, and none of it was seriously. Why can't sex be funny?! Why not, indeed! Well, the movie pretty solidly carried on the series' unique treatment of sex. I mean, probably the best scene in the film was the would-be threesome haha. Unfortunately, I just can't appreciate the weird goat-rape scene.\n\n4) Thad and Alex. I may be in the minority on this, but I truly love both of these characters equally. To me it wouldn't be a BMS story without some parry between those two--and the movie certainly gave me that. \n\n\nNow, as much as I loved the film, it is far from perfect. The goat-rape thing...not my favorite. And more jokes than usual fell flat for me at the start of the film, and I *really* wanted to see some more of Radon and Coach. But knowing the production and cast issues this movie faced honestly makes me forgive a lot, *especially* since the movie sets us up beautifully for a senior year movie/series!!! They honestly could have blown through Moran's senior year in this film. Which, I honestly think would have devastated me because I'd know that the movie is the \"end\" had it gone that way. But they didn't. :) Instead they got rid of the replacement house, set us up for more Thadventures, and we have a good point where the series can continue!", "The show is hilarious and so cleverly written but the movie just feels like a weak, useless and dull excuse to show us the characters again without giving us anything new or giving us a clever story", "Definitely enjoyed it. But I'm not going to lie, I wish Craig Shilo and Raydon were in it more. I was bummed when each of them were only in the show for 1 season each. ", "I enjoyed it. Not as good as the series, but certainly had its moments. I loved that they brought back Shilo and Radon.", "To be honest, movie was really meh, it wasnt boring but i wouldnt watch it again.

Then the movie would at least revolve around football. They could still party at the beginning/end of the film and all of the characters would be in their element.

In my opinion, this animated performance is one of the best I've seen among CGI characters in live-action movies from an artistic and an acting standpoint.

", "This movie is about a man with Fregoli's Delusion/Schizophrenia. If you remeber it was set in a Hotel called The Fregoli. For me I basically experienced how it feels like to hear voices and it's rather hard to concentrate. If you noticed, the voices were never gone which started from the beginning, all throughout the movie and up to the credits. The voices were only gone if he's either on headphones or inside his room which is why he always ask the girls to go to his room with him so he doesn't have to hear the voices. The faces were the Fregoli Delusion which a sufferer would think that everyone's faces and voices are the same, making the person thinks everyone is a lie. The other faces in the movie are actually *Monalisa's* almost similar to its title Anomalisa. It helps explain a lot cause anomaly means the only exception, so the girl Lisa is the only exception from all the other *monalisa* faces. It explains why Charlie Kaufman chose stop-motion animation and not real human to make the artistic effect more accurately achieved. There are lots of profound dimensions in this movie that i find very interesting. I hope this helps in deciphering the film.\nThe movie gave a lot of metaphors about how mundane human life is especially the feeling of loneliness and finding it hard to connect with someone which is so brilliant because in similarity, the disorder gives the sufferer a conundrum in finding a real connection with others or the world itself. The movie is insanely deep and full of refractions", "/u/TheAustinKnight had a great comment in /r/flicks about Anomalisa:\n\n>I don't think it's either cynical or trying to make the audience empathize with Michael Stone; rather, I see it as a condemnation of the narcissism that's so easily acquired in modern society--witness how one of the first actions we see Michael do is put on an iPod rather than deal with the world around him. I think Anomalisa is, weirdly enough, a celebration of normality as well as a satire of the sort of indie film where two \"outsiders\" are magically saved from dealing with other people by meeting each other.\n\n\n>Despite his view of \"everyone else\" as being vacuous, it's Michael who seems to be truly empty. He has no real interests, no zest for anything, and seems to be content to wallow in his self pity and vices--I mean, for goodness sake, the man can't even get interested in My Man Godfrey! While we may begin the film empathizing with him, laughing at our own tendencies to drown the world out, by the dawn we're actively rooting against him. At the end of the film, he's learned absolutely nothing, wrecked his marriage and relationships with his son and friends, and seems to doom himself to his future.\n\n\n>By contrast, it's Lisa, the supposedly \"dull\" girl, who seems to have the real heart. Yeah, she likes dumb stuff and finds intense personal meaning in one of the most grating, dated pop songs of all time--but, honestly, what's so wrong with that? She allows herself to actually get giddy and excited over the now rather than shutting the present out of her life, even if said present can be frightening or even hurtful. At the end, she seems to understand that it's for the best that she and Michael part, even if she doesn't say so. She learns from the experience--not because Michael saved her, but because he abandoned her. She picks herself up, grows a spine, and seems to be headed toward a brighter future.\n\n\n>I didn't really see Anomalisa as a film about fleeting connections--except maybe as a strike against the belief in them, or against the idea that just meeting the \"one person\" is going to save or change your life. Instead, it's a celebration of ordinary moments and connections, of being lost in the crowd. It's a retaliation against both the \"you're special\" message of society (inasmuch as that message can foster denial of others) and the current Hollywood/indiewood obsession with Chosen Ones. It's about allowing yourself to actively choose to find happiness in anything, rather than mucking about and waiting for it to strike you like lightning.", "The scene where Michael and Lisa are having breakfast and her voice is slowly losing it's lustre was fantastic. It was a gut-punch and an amazing way to depict Michael's inherent loneliness and inability to love. I imagine Michael will be considered a pretty detestable character to some, but i only really felt pity for him. His disconnection from others has made him the asshole he is and his struggle to relate to others is perfectly captured with the voice acting choices.\n\nWhat i love about Kaufman's work is how personal and sympathetic it so often is, Anomalisa does not let down on that front. I particularly loved the final scene of Lisa reading her letter to Michael, it drove home just how troubled Michael is in comparison to Lisa; who actually has some capacity to care and will be able to overcome any heartbreak she experiences. All in all i thought it was a very thoughtful and beautifully created film, the stop-motion was top-notch and lent itself really well to the subject matter, if you're a fan of Kaufman's other work, I'm sure you'll love this too.", "The critics who say that this movie is particularly dour and depressing, even for a Charlie Kaufman movie, overlook one thing: _Anomalisa_ has a happy ending.\n\nMichael Stone goes back to his family and to his life in a sea of samey faces -- true. He doesn't get to run away with Lisa and live happily ever after.

If you recall the scene in the hotel room when he calls his ex fling, Bella, he remarks that he doesn't recognize her voice.

Just as Michael Stone is collapsing under himself, overcome by his self obsession, and loathing of others, it just kinda ends. And that's **exactly** what I think makes Kaufman a brilliant director/writer. Just like in Synechdoche New York, he's completely unafraid to tell a tragic story, about how sometimes, people never excape themselves. PSH obsesses with death every second of his life until he finally just dies, having missed all the human connections he should have been focusing on. \n\nIn this one, it's a bit more self contained, but we still see that heart breaking arc, of this self-absorbed person just receeding further and further into themselves. All the while Lisa, who were supposed to see as dumb, and average, manages to find happiness in her connections. \n\nMaybe it's implying ignorance is bliss, or maybe it's just telling us to go outside and talk to people, either way, easily my favorite film of the year.\n\n(Note: I actually saw this film at it's premeire at Telluride 5 or 6 months ago, and got to see the Kaufman in person, he absolutely refused to talk about interpretations of the film, which I loved as well)\n\nTechnically, I think the film is a marvel. It works so hard to be anti-animation, and it pulls it off damn well. I know it's cliche at this point to talk about that sex scene, but seriously, when's the last time a sex scene felt that real? But it's more than that, there's that one scene when Michael walks through the beaded door of the sex shop, and the light blinds him, we get this moment where the camera isn't focused correctly, and the store is just this bright blur, before his eyes adjust, and all the sudden, this flat animated world has gained a whole new sense of depth as it gradually comes into focus. There's so much attention on working with the camera as a tool, instead of just playing with whats in front of the camera. And it's honestly about damn time animation in America started using the full range of visual storytelling, and I never thought it'd be Chalrie Kaufman who would show us the way.", "This is one of those movies that's even better on the re-watch. The sheer quality of the writing shows in even the \"throwaway\" lines: when Michael asks his ex \"at any point did you feel like you changed, like anything changed?\". At first, it sounds like a longing for someone to relate to. Then you think about what Michael sees with Lisa the morning after, and the questions he asks from before takes on a whole new meaning!", "This film did not sit well with me.  I felt claustrophobic the entire time.  I just found it way too depressing.  Maybe it's because of where I'm at in life, but even if I were 100% happy I don't think it would make much of a difference.  While I see what he was doing and I thought it was a great idea film-wise, having all the voices the same made me feel crazy.  And although I didn't notice all the other characters had the same face until about 30 minutes in, I knew something was off and it was bothering me.  Once I figured it out it bothered me even more.\n\nI certainly have to appreciate a film that can make me feel such dramatic emotions like that, but I just don't think it's a film that I would recommend to a friend.  It just made me feel so bleh.\n\nAfter watching the trailer I thought I was going to love it but it was quite different than what I was expecting.", "good luck because tom noonan's voice is going to haunt your nightmares for at least a week, i guarantee it", "Liked the smaller focus on one day and place in comparison to Synecdoche, and loved the way it used its conceit: the dream flirts with a plot-based answer to everyone looking the same, which the movie rejects in favor of a character one.\n\nI took Lisa's letter not to be a reflection of her happiness and lack of Fregoli disease, but of the disease making Michael romanticize his past as he had with the ex-girlfriend he initially met at the bar. He was imagining her as the Japanese goddess.\n\nInterestingly, from the behind the scenes footage on youtube you can see that Jennifer Jason Leigh sings the Japanese song. I think the image of Michael staring at a robot mannequin at a party filled with people who all the look the same is a great, horrible Twilight Zone end for the character.\n\nOutside of Fregoli disease, he is obsessing over an ideal, and that ideal is pathetic, an old automaton with semen leaking out of it. A sex doll. He can't form human relationships, can only romanticize the past or the future. He is trapped in his job and family. I think this is a very common state.", "I saw the poster quote that said \"Anomalisa changed my life.\" I thought it was just normal overhyped stuff. I was wrong. I was so wrong. My favorite film of the year bar none. ", "In typical Kaufman style, almost everything about the movie is related to the central idea. Michael is an expert on customer service and in a way this is connected to his deeper personal experience in making social masks for himself and pleasing people who want something from him. It is fun exploring these deeper connections inside the film, but I was also surprised when the story ended quickly. It is a short story with a simple setup, and I think the film would have been better if it had been longer and more complex, and Michael\u2019s problems had been explored deeper. Because right now, they are presented as just one of those things that happen in life, without giving it a deeper meaning or a deeper insight into the causes.\n\nThere is a lot of artistry in this movie. The voice work by David Trewlis as Michael, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Lisa and Tom Noonan as everyone else is phenomenal. Together with the subtle expressions of the puppets and the realistic lights and colors of the surroundings, I was totally sucked into the film. It is excellently written and I am somewhat relieved that the film is not necessarily standing on the side of the main character, but matters of good and bad are kept neutral and people are not labeled as one or the other.", "I was lucky and got tickets to an advanced screening of this in my city. While there, I saw a mother come in with her two young children. Since the film was not officially rated in my area yet, I'm guessing she was unaware of the film's mature content. Though I was expecting her to take the kids out partway through, surprisingly they stayed right to the end.\n\nAfter the movie, I heard the kids talking about it. One of them said \"That was AWESOME!\". The other one plainly pointed out \"They had sex.\"\n\nI would've liked to have known more on what their thoughts were, since I assumed most kids would just find this boring.

As a long-time Kaufman fan (and a *Synecdoche, New York* fanatic), this movie just felt a little slow and disjointed. It just wasn't much fun to watch. I didn't mind that the protagonist was unlikable, and I didn't mind that it was possibly depressing and felt unresolved at the end.\n\nIt just seemed like poor form for Kaufman. It felt like it lacked complexity and depth, and it didn't seem to have that cohesive dark humor and interconnectedness that his his other works have. \n\nIt felt like it had the \"small-film\" subject matter of something like *Whiplash* but without the singularity of purpose or dramatic pacing or humor that propelled that movie onward so well. It just felt meandering and slow and a little bit like stretched-out posturing, with overt symbolism and meaning.\n\nPerhaps I didn't get everything out of it that I should have. But it is the first time I haven't liked something Kaufman put out, and although it doesn't at all change my opinion of him or his work in general, I am a bit disappointed.", "While I didn't connect to this as much as Eternal Sunshine or get as intellectually challenged as Synecdoche, NY this one still deeply impressed me. Kaufman just gets the perfect little subtleties of human emotion and the way he uses real life mental disorders (in this case the [Fregoli delusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fregoli_delusion)) to get at simple issues we all face is brilliant. The idea of a single voiced unanimous organism is a perfect metaphor for the selfish, depressed individual and the way Lisa's voice melts away is such a gut punch to anyone who's felt like Michael. I love how much Kaufman pushes the form. The script was originally a radio play and Kaufman said he loved the idea of one person playing all the other parts besides the leads. Now he pushes the animation medium by not just including that element but also visualizing the facial animations and even deliberately showing them falling apart. Also I think making a stop motion animated film that could have reasonably been shot traditionally showcases not only the immense ambition of Kaufman but also helps us focus on the little aspects that took so much craft. When was the last time you looked so closely at an ice maker or fog on a mirror, but that's what Kaufman does so well: intimacy, detail, ambition, and intelligence.

That being said it was was pretty solid. I'd argue the weakest of the three, but still a nice close to the Kung Fu Panda movies. The acting was great, the characters where still great, the biggest issue was the pacing for me. How it would go from the Panda's training, to them being silly, to actual really serious things. It just hurt the climax for me. \n\nHOWEVER this movie was insanely good looking. Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni deserve a massive shout out. It wasn't the quality of the animation, but the use of lighting, 2D, style changes, and the split screens. The way the movie broke up like that was brilliant.

There were a few things that really grabbed me about this movie that were unique from the previous two.\n\n* The look of the spirit realm was incredible. A gold glow to everything that really grabbed your attention.\n* Kai's first appearance and his accompanying musical theme. Felt almost Imperial March-ish. Helps that his weapons naturally brought a very imposing rhythm to his scenes.\n* On that point, his demeanor was actually quite refreshing for a villain. Didn't take himself too seriously but he was still imposing. Kind of reminded me of Hans Gruber (just watched Die Hard a week ago)\n* Po's interactions with his two fathers felt very authentic. I'm always pleased by how well Jack Black manages to interweave his more known comedic side with the more emotional/\"dramatic\" portions of the film.\n\nThere were a few parts I wasn't a huge fan of (the dunce/hugging character felt a bit much though I imagine this was for the younger audience. Also felt the Dragon Warrior transformation/fight sequence felt gratuitous) but overall, it was a great film. \n\nI think overall these three films, my favorite character is Master Shifu. Dustin Hoffman does an amazing job and some of his lines are my favorite. Laughed hardest when he said \"There's so much wisdom in here I can't find the scroll\". ", "Something about the Kung Fu Panda series I've always appreciated is that they are so unique in their story telling, not the story itself necessarily. I've always loved Disney movies, but they're also very standard, hero is introduced, they go through a struggle, the bad guy is usually the friend/cousin who schemes to take over and the hero defeats them in the end. Frozen is a wonderful movie, with absolutely gorgeous design and great music, but it's basically the same story. \n\nKung Fu Panda had a wonderful theme of accepting that things don't always go your way and that you should never judge a book by it's cover. Kung Fu Panda 2 has similar themes, how we must move past the terrible things that have happened in the past and a very sweet subplot about parents and the lengths they go to.\n\n The thing that surprised me is how it embraces eastern philosophy, Disney characters are simply Americans in exotic locations, but Kung Fu Panda actually tries to use the location and themes. Oogway's explaining how we are simply small players in a much larger world and we can only choose how to play the hand we are dealt. How Po's anger and confusion are justified but rather then let them control him (like Shen) he must simply accept that they are a part of him and move forward. ", "Really really really enjoyed this one. The start was a little rushed for my tastes but it settles into itself and by the time they get to Panda Village it hits its stride. Also the theme for Kai was fantastic!", "This was great, not as great as the second film in my opinion, but still **very** good. This felt more cartoonish and silly which my neices enjoyed very much but I loved how dark the second was. But the character development of Po did not disappoint and that's what all of these movies do so well in that Po truly does grow as the series progresses. He becomes more sure of himself and mature.\n\nI enjoyed JK Simmons and Bryan Cranston's performances.

The characters are alive, the action is really well choreographed, the animators use every scrap of movement to their advantage, the colors are rich, the music is inviting, and the villains are memorable.

However, I felt it sort of deviated from the other films in terms of how dark it was. The others, especially the 2nd, felt more serious with better action sequences and dialogue, while this one felt like it had more \"funny moments\", almost to the point where it was nonstop. Yes, I realize this is a kids movie, but I just didn't really like it when you thought something cool and badass was going to happen... then Poe says a joke or something which kind of ruins the build up. It didn't really have any \"stand out\" epic scenes like I remember the previous 2 for. I also think the whole Ooguay and Kai relationship where Kai fell due to the desire of power reminded me of Shifu and Tai Lung.

Everything else I thought was good. 8/10.", "I have been waiting years for Kung Fu Panda 3! \n\nAnd at least one aspect was worth the wait. This film is beautiful. So damn beautiful. Just like the 2nd one was when it came out, I loved the animation styles, the fight scenes, the attention to detail that went into every little fiber of every baby panda.\n\nMy main problem with it is that too much of the film was Po training and preparing. The 2nd film was really great because he was already the dragon warrior, so it started with him kicking ass and went nonstop almost. This one made it feel like the first film, where we had delayed bad assery thanks to all the panda training. The best part of action/super hero sequels is avoiding the training or origin story. \n\nAlso, I will say that the hidden weapon of finding his chi? Feels too much like the last film, where his greatness wasn\u2019t good enough until he found inner peace. This is just inner peace part 2.\n\nI know I sound complainy, I just wanted this to be my favorite animated film of the year, thus the disappointment. It is still quite funny and very well made, so I am happy for that.\n\nYou can see my [full review here](http://gorgview.com/kung-fu-panda-3)! :)\n", "Basically what I was expecting after glancing Rotten Tomatoes and the trailer. Overall a positive movie with funny moments but not as good as the others.\n\nOne thing to consider is that this movie is far more comedic then the first two. It isn't as serious and Kai himself becomes frustrated by his inability to menace. However, that was utterly expected given that Po *is* the silliest character in the first two movies and the previews showed us that we where getting a village full of Po.\n\nTaking the trilogy as a whole the tonal shift also makes sense to me. The second movie didn't leave much room for a serious villain in the third. How do you top Po becoming a true martial arts master and Shen as a dramatic villain? How do you up the stakes? Kung Fu Panda 3's answer is to *sidestep*, take a different tone, and play it differently.\n\nThat brings me back to Kai. I think he worked great for what they where trying to do. He *tries* to be super cool and takes the time to show off but it never quite works. Yet once it doesn't work he just shrugs his shoulders and gets to the ass kicking. He doesn't spend time whining about it because he does have the strength to back up his threats.\n\nI also believe that this entry was really going for Yin Yang (and practically spelled out their intentions). That it was balance between serious and being yourself/having fun. That it reached back to the original movie to tie that theme into the entire series. Shifu's growth in the first movie as sparked by Po made him a calmer, more laid back, and better martial artist into this movie. Some of this subtext may be easier to spot on a rewatch of the relevant scenes.\n\nThe last thing I wanted to mention was that goose Dad (Mr. Ping) easily stole the show and had the best lines in the movie.", "KFP3 was damn beautiful. The scenes had 3D, 2D, and mixed animation that just blended so well. There were at least 15+ moments where I wish I could just pause and make background wallpapers of this film. Also the humor and puns were fantastic. It didn't feel forced and the jokes we're tied in very smoothly.", "It was good, visuals were cool, felt more kid cartoon like than the other two. There was no real character development either, even Po's stuff was just like \"I have two dads now whoa\" He does no real training then becomes like a super power budha right at the end.\n\nPo and tigress didn't even become a couple, it was like one of the major themes in the second movie.

The music, as usual, was stellar. I love how they mix animating styles in this franchise. Another thing I love is just how much FUN these movies are. Yes, there's serious and sad moments, but even when things are dark there's still a lot of hope and playfulness.

I was surprised that they pulled a hat trick with this series and avoided taking the easy way out.\n\nThe movie also avoided using stale or old jokes while still maintaining a comfortable tone and using callbacks.\n\nAlso happy to see \"2 dads\" exploring the relationships of adoptive and natural-born parents.

The concept of realms, nothing explained. How does Oogway's chi help Kai return back to mortal realm? What was so special in it? If Kai was a master equal to Oogway, then with the chi of all the masters, he should have been able to escape to mortal realm all by himself.\n\n3. Villagers and kids are able to handle THE MASTERS with such small training. You might say that Po was able to do the same in the first part, but he had Shifu as a teacher, who taught him real Kung Fu. Po was shown to not have the teaching skills in the first half of the movie itself. It doesn't make sense. The Five were not able to handle the masters, but villagers were. Sorry, can't believe that.\n   \n4. And the biggest one was the climax! Everyone just says out loud \"what they think they are\" and BOOM, they are chi masters. Masters to the level that they transferred not only their chi to Po in spirit realm, but also made him a bigger master there! Seriously? \nIn the first part, what touched me was \"There is not special ingredient\". Nice!\nIn the second part, Po was running away from who he was. In the climax he accepted his past life, the truth and attained inner peace.

Drat.\n\nStill, a top notch film, and that the scriptwriters did their homework with regards to Chinese culture and kung fu in particular is, once again, evident.

Kinda makes me wonder why they didn't release it a few weeks ago (against The Hateful Eight)", "Not sure if any of you watch Naruto, but Kai reminded me of Pain, in how he used his \"chi\" to see through and also control attacks", "I just want to ask, isn't Li Shan supposed to be a Kung Fu master or warrior too?? As I remember on the post-credit scene on KFP2, Li Shan was seen wearing a somewhat similar cloak/robe to Master Oogway and Master Shifu. He's like meditating and then the universe told him that his son (Po) is alive. Isn't that weird? 'coz in the movie, he's just a plain old panda. I really hoped he shows some bad-ass awesome kung fu. But overall, the movie is great, though not as great as the first 2 films.\n\nIf this is somewhat a spoiler, please bear with me. I'm new here :)", "[deleted]", "What I did not get is why wouldn't Kai use Oogway as his soldier even though he had his Chi?", "Great film. I laughed a lot, and the voice acting for these is always top notch. Just really enjoyable and great for the family. Would've loved a little more of the Five, but I still loved it. Bryan Cranston and JK Simmons especially killing it. ", "It's not the *best* Kung Fu Panda movie (With that distinction going to the second film), but it is still a really solid great installment into the franchise, and I feel that after such a *stellar* second movie, some people may or may not be let down by the direction it took. Here's my personal opinion on the film, and trust me I do have to say a lot...\n\n\n**You guys ready to see the Great Wall of Text?**\n\n**PART I: WHAT I DID LIKE**\n\nSo what's good about the film? Well...just like the first two movies, this one continues the tradition of having great choreographed fighting scenes whilst blending in fast paced and hilarious comedy. The speed of the movements and the rapidity of the jokes has always been a staple of the series, and it doesn't fail to disappoint here in those regards. There are the quiet jokes and the loud abrasive jokes and everything in between, and there were plenty of moments while watching in the theaters that I burst out laughing. I am a huge sucker for physical slapstick comedy, and the Kung Fu Panda series is my favorite modern example to just how good and fast paced slapstick can really be.\n\nAnother good thing that has been a staple to the series is the animation; specifically the backgrounds. My fucking god, some of these background shots are *beautiful* and look like they belong on a panoramic painting. The mountains are titanic, the valleys run deep, the fog blending it in together to make it seem like Shangri-La up in the heavens. But those are the background, what about the foregrounds? Just as good too! As I stated before, the action is still pretty tight and quick, so kudos to the animators on those parts.\n\nI especially love the staple scenes where the movie is sort of \"painted\" or \"bamboo'd\" in and splices different views and scenes into the same screen. If you've seen the movies, you'd know what I mean. Animated stuff like that I really enjoyed. And some scenes are just so lovely to look at as well. Two scenes stand out in particular for me; the backstory explaining the history of Master Oogway and Kai as well as the training montage where Po trains the pandas of the village. The former is just so beautifully animated and the second one has such striking colors that I loved it visually.\n\nI also really liked the villain a lot personally. True, I still prefer Lord Shen from the second movie, but Kai from the third movie is really good in his own regards. I really love how they are handling the villains right now. Tai Lung from the first movie was a little generic halfway between threatening and funny. Lord Shen from the second movie was very threatening with bouts of comedic gold. The third movie's villain, Kai, leans more heavily towards the comedic side but is still pretty great himself. As stated, he cracks more jokes and isn't afraid to give the audience a chuckle, but he is still threatening in a cool way.\n\nThe way Kai fought was using two giant jade/emerald blades which were strung by chains wrapped around his wrists. He would use these chains and blades to manipulate him and the world around him. Moving objects, grappling himself forward, wrapping them around someone to reel them in, break huge objects right into two, it's all around a great fighting style that had me interested. I really like those two villains a lot. Lord Shen had his massive cannons, armies of dogs, his giant tail feathers and his really cool looking staff sword thing while Kai had his massive chain guided jade/emerald swords, a small but indestructible jade zombie army, and the gift of immortality. So while I like Lord Shen more than Kai, both are still really awesome in their regards, with one being more serious and the other being more comedic. (Sorry Tai Lung, you're just a tad bit too generic for my tastes.)\n\nAlso I love the continuation of Po's teachings as well as the expanse upon more East Asian philosophies. I love how Po is not just a static character, and even when it has shown at the end of the movie that he has learned much already, there is still very much more to learn. He doesn't just learn kung fu from the first movie and is done for the rest, he has to learn and adapt new moves and philosophies if he is to survive. Speaking of philosophies, just on a personal note I love the film's strong lean towards chi. I remember my grandfather used to practice tai chi every morning in front of the television while he watched the news or another Steven Seagal movie or The Ten Commandments for the billionth time. So I just like that aspect of the film on a more personal level.\n\nAnd one final good note is that I am so glad about the liar revealed story in this. Most movies I know that use the liar revealed stories do them so poorly. Everyone becomes pissy poor and moaning and the movie treats it as some big thing and we spend a good considerable chunk of time on the moment before everyone gets their shit together for the final scenes. I really like how it was handled here. For a second, I was afraid they were going to go down that same route, and I was expecting to hate it a lot. But instead the scene came, it ended fast, and quickly moves into two scenes that feed from the liar revealed but also progress the story; the scene where Li Shan and Mr. Ping discuss what it means to be a father as well as where Po and Master Tigress discuss what to do when Po realizes what has to be done. The Liar Revealed plot didn't last more than two or three scenes, it wasn't that heavy handed in my opinion, and most of all they were done quickly so we could get back to the movie. I like it when Kung Fu Panda 3 did that and didn't dwell on the liar revealed fact for too long.\n\n", "Did any of you guys love the cinematography as much as I did? It was gorgeous! Particularly (for me anyway) the fight sequences that resembled Chinese art.", "Just saw it I liked it tho my favorite is the second one and I wish this one had the same dark tone it was still good, I hope they make a 4th one!!! ", "I liked it, but the second one was much better. Also, why wasn't Tigress given more airtime?", "With Kung-Fu Panda being 1 movie per chapter there are still 3 to go after this 1. I'm interested to see how the story will pan out ", "These movies are as good as Star Wars to me. The mythology, the characters, the universe....it's just beautiful", "Such a disappointment from the hype built up by Kung Fu Panda 2. The action was lackluster, a lot of the jokes fell flat, and the plot seemed to be rushed and drag all at the same time. They clearly had good ideas going into this, but failed to deliver in a huge way. Introducing Chi as this immensely important thing forced me to ask why it hasn't been mentioned before, and I also had to question why people didn't just always do the finger hold. The villain managed to be threatening, but he relied on a concept that I never fully got behind, and his final battle was undercut with a victorious theme like Po had already one which killed the stakes. And the characters like the furious 5 were shafted by the new pandas, while others like Po's dad were flanderized and out of character. That being said the jokes that landed were golden (like Po and his Dad's oblivious first meeting), the animation and voice acting are as great as usual, and there were clearly good intentions in making this. But overall the movie felt scatterbrained and all over the place, failed to utilize key characters, and didn't even make Po and Tigress a couple (which sucks because the sexual tension there is so real.) I'd give it a 4/10 and recommend it to children exclusively. To everyone else, I'd recommend Kung Fu Panda 2 for its killer action, well-developed story, and the best villain in an animated movie ever."], "num_comments": 279, "year": "2020"}, {"title": "What was the best scene or moment from a 2015 film?", "comments": ["Definitely this exchange from The Hateful Eight:\n\n\n\"Throw your pistol up here!\"\n\n*pistol is tossed up from cellar*\n\n\"I bet he got another one... throw up your other pistol!\"\n\n\"I ain't got another pistol!\"\n\n\"WELL YOU BETTER SHIT ANOTHER PISTOL OUT YO ASS CAUSE IF ONE DON'T GET THROWN UP HERE IN THE NEXT 2 SECONDS, WE GON' KILL THIS BITCH!\"\n\n*second pistol gets tossed up*", "Say adios to your Huevos.

They don't spoon-feed it to you, you have to fill in the \"plot holes\" yourself by actually paying attention to what the movie *does* tell you.\n\nBraums murdered that girl as a child, and so his parents faked his death because they were either afraid of him or too afraid to lose their son, (probably a bit of both). So they raised him in secret in a sort of pseudo-denial, so that they wouldn't have to lose their \"precious little angel\" for something he did when he was 8. The rest explains itself. Him living in the walls is why the music had to be played loudly for him; why he had to be read to in a clear and loud voice; why the doll only ever moved when no one was around; why they weren't allowed to throw away food, instead putting it in the freezer; why they took so much care ensuring rats didn't get into the walls; why Braums was able to talk through the phone, (there was another one in his real room); and, of course, why the camera drew so much attention to there being little port-holes in the walls that allowed the \"doll\" to hear people talking through the walls.\n\nIt doesn't really excuse the fake-out jump scares the movie had, but at least that gave the trailers something to show without actually spoiling anything for a goddamned change.", "Honestly, I liked it. It ended up being much more original than I anticipated, and the ending legitimately took my by surprise. Also, I felt the movie effectively relied mostly on atmosphere and mood as opposed jump scares to give a constant sense of dread and unease. Definitely a couple \"wtf\" moments, as it was by no means a perfect plot, but overall I enjoyed the acting, the originality, and the excellent cinematography. Far and away the months best horror film (looking at you, The Forest) and probably will end up being one of the better of 2016. ", "SPOILERS: \n\nI enjoyed it. It was definitely better than what I was expecting, being a January horror flick not pre screened to critics and advertised almost exclusively to tweens.

The reveal to me was slightly unexpected and really well done I think. There were some problems with Greta's character, as she kinda took an affection to the doll really fast and really oddly. I feel like the movie could have used a longer epilogue, to explain the logistics that were only hinted at. And to explain why the parents took care of the doll in the first place, really. ", "Spoilers of course:\nI honestly thought the first two thirds were great. It didn't give much relief from the CONSTANT tension/anticipation/build up jazz. It was also very disappointing that the biggest scares from the trailer were freakin dream sequences (the doll's head turning and the painting's arm). That and I feel like Brahm's parents' suicide was put in at a very irrelevent moment - it really could've instigated crazy stuff if they found out later.\n\nAs for the last third, I thought the twist's reveal was great - very surprising and creepy. But then it got lame fast. The chase scene was very vague and, to me, forced. I feel like the only reason they went behind the walls (an area the pursuing killer is extremely familiar with) was so they could find his little sanctum for a plot device.

The hints in the movie were good, I agree with everyone else about just wanting a little more history on the family/story. I've read through every comment on here, and I may be the only crazy that wishfully thought Greta would stay with Brahms and be a motherly figure to him (assuming Brahms was still only a doll that was possessed) and he end up sort of a hero.

The fight scene with Mike Tyson and the final fight with the other Wing Chin master are definitely highlights not to be missed! \n\nFor the story, personally I liked it as it's much more personal and introspective compared to the previous installments. The whole theme of the story this time revolves around the conflict between the smaller circle of your loved ones (husband, wife, children), vs the greater good (community, society, honor). It's really interesting to see both sides putting pressure on Ip Man and watching how he chooses to handle those different aspects of his life. [Spoilers](#s He started off with taking care of the community, and neglected his wife for some time, which is a recurring theme even from the previous movies. Then when the bomb drops, he paid no attention to things happening outside, only focusing on the last days he had with his wife. Both the fight at the dock and the elevator fight scene shows how far he'd go to protect his child and his wife.)\n\nOn the other hand, there's also the contrast of ambitions and personalities between the grandmasters. Even if they both came from the same school of martial arts, their outlook in life is vastly different. This theme is echoed in the hooligan disciple and his master -- you can teach someone punches and kicks, but what goes on in their mind still goes back to individual character. \n\nAs for Mike Tyson, as a native Cantonese speaker myself, good god I wished they just kept him speaking English throughout the movie instead of shouting random words in Cantonese/Mandarin hybrid or whatever that is. The fight scene is solid though, but that plot has much to be desired. [Mike Tyson is Frankie](#s why is he so obsessed with getting that school is never explained neither. And who is this secret boss of \"Frankie\" and the British police officer, we'll never know.) \n\nPlenty of emotional scenes this time around, I actually cried at quite a few scenes by the third act. Girlfriends and wives will like this installment, IMO!", "Rambling thoughts.\n\nThe final fight was kinda an anti-climax. The story was really about Wing-sing having cancer, but I feel like the final fight didn't have the emotional weight.\n\nFor a slight comparison, remember how Ip Man 1 was structured. Now imagine if they switched the two halves, except instead of Ip Man getting shot after winning his battle and moving to China the story just had Ip Man win and then just kinda walk away to move on to the next part of the story. That's more or less what happened here. (At least in Ip Man 2, the first half had an emotional crux to it, Ip Man finding students and trying to make a living). Here, the fight scene had nothing really to do with Wing-sing, nor was there any real consequences to the battle other than being called #1. Even the \"disrespect\" given to Ip Man and his martial arts wasn't what Ip Man was really fighting for at the end, and given the rounding out of Cheung Tin-chi, he's not really seen as a villain, just a strong martial artist wanting to fight Ip Man.\n\nOn the bright side, the story didn't go through yet another foreign devil/nationalism fight as the climax, though the first half had that feeling of it in spades. But the first half could have easily just be about corruption in general without it being a race thing, especially since Tyson's go to guy was home-grown. Honestly, I kinda wish Tyson took the role as the \"rival\" moreso than crimeboss, but I think his role was, well not satisfactory since his crimes and corruption go nowhere in the second half, but his fight was fun enough to make it worth it. \n\nOther stuff I wish was fleshed out more was Bruce Lee (of course). Yes, I would have loved to see Bruce Lee be trained by Ip Man, but I would've liked to just see Bruce Lee train Ip Man to dance, that would have been a nice cameo scene that could've been shown on screen.\n\nOther characters I wish were fleshed out were the Muay Thai fighter (I wonder if he had a backstory or a real-life counterpart), along with Ip Man's current disciples and the school. That subplot between one of his disciples and the teacher goes nowhere. I get the story was ultimately about Wing-sing and Ip Man, but then if that were truly the case, the later stuff should've been cut/tighter to allow the relationship to be fleshed out, or the final boss Chedung Tin-chi and the rivalry to be fleshed out more. \n\nI'd even argue the relationship of Ip Man and Wing-sing wasn't very strong, but that's always because Ip Man feels like his relationship with her was based off Goku's relationship with ChiChi, though I'll give the story credit. When Ip Man found out about Wing-sing's condition, he was there for her all the way which was sweet. \n\nI also wish we got more of the cast to return to Ip Man 3 from the previous films. I couldn't recall if the old martial art teachers that appeared were also the teachers in the previous films or not.\n\nVery unfortunate, but I didn't like how the first two action scenes were choreographed. In fact, the overall choreography/shots taken felt choppy or were too close up in this film so it's harder to appreciate the action scenes. That said, there's still a number of nice action pieces in here.\n\nPlus side, no one needlessly died due to pride, which bothered me in the first two films. \n\nOverall, I'd rank the Ip Man films in chronological order. 1, 2, then 3.

I was getting really mad at that one scene for Ip Man's son was crying for at least 3 minutes. It's just bad design / directing, I couldn't stand the volume and how long he was crying.

There were a few random action scenes that didn't really contribute to the story, but my god I love the action in this movie the most.\n\nOverall: I didn't expect much from the story or quality directing.

She was great in Ex Machina and The Man From U.N.C.L.E and im definitely going to keep following her career from now on (looking forward to seeing her in the next Bourne movie)", "I will speak simply from opinion as I'm sure they had reasons for making their choices. \n\nI expected to really like this film, and unlike many here, I actually do adore Eddie Redmayne as an actor. On the whole, I felt that the film was incredibly well-cast, with strong performances all around. The cinematography and art direction were superb, and there were some very strong story moments. \n\nThat being said, my major problem with the film is that it's hard to be truly invested in the story. Once she has started living as a woman, Lily is incredibly unsympathetic, often callous, and seems to demand all of Gerta's attention and energy, but not care to thank her, or comfort her during a difficult time, except with minimal effort. I agree with Lily's choice not to \"be\" male again to comfort Gerta, but I would have liked to see her care about Gerta's struggle. While it's reasonable that she would have been so consumed with what was going on with her body and identity, they never truly redeemed the damage she inflicted on Gerta (who's incredibly sympathetic and strong), making a film about helping this woman in her transition come off as unfulfilling. \n\nIn real life, Gerta and Lily eventually lived as a lesbian couple; it wasn't about Lily's sex, but about who she was. They were able to come together again, and fall in love in a completely different way. By making Lily no longer romantically love Gerta, and by having Gerta go to another man, they robbed the audience of a stronger story- two people finding their identities with each other, and falling in love in a different way. Also, since they set up such a strong love story with Lily and Gerta in the first act, it felt confusing to see Lily's behaviour afterward. \n\nI wonder if they were trying to mimic the actual paintings: Lily is someone we see from Gerta's eyes. We don't get to know her, just see her, and experience her. Even the scenes where Lily is alone, she's looking in mirrors, or at diagrams of what she thinks her body might be going through. Her entire identity is projected onto her. While certainly there's nothing wrong with this choice, and it's quite valid, I still would have liked to understand more about Lily, to hear more of her voice. Maybe that would have helped. \n\nI was okay with the pacing, though I understand why some found it slow. It wasn't a traditionally structured story, but I think that it worked for what it was.", "Solid movie. Would not watch it again, but I did like it.

", "damn i saw this over a month ago. still not sure how i feel about it. something about it felt off, maybe the pacing? hard to say right now. it was almost like everybody was seemingly making poor choices and nobody else seemed to give a shit or even notice. like Redmayne's character would make these odd choices and you'd think \"well that's not cool at all, right Vikander?\" and then she'd be ok with it and you'd be like \"oh, ok well whatever you say i guess\". ", "I wasn't going to comment... but I feel now I should. I have been dealing with my gender identity for years and I have never cried like I did after watching Danish Girl. \n\nI loved this film, I loved the music, Eddie Redmayne, Alicia Vikander, the whole cast. \n\nWhat I've noticed is that Eddie is getting a lot of hate which sucks, because I thought he did so well. Every time he whispered \"Lily\" I got anxious. Because saying the name just makes everything more real and that's terrifying. It's another aspect of this HUGE part of your life. Yet it's only a part of your life, but nonetheless it's huge. \n\nWhen he looked in the mirror, the gender dysphoria came back to me. The times I've looked in the mirror to try and see my masculine side is not even funny. It's a moment of realisation where you have a body you don't want, but you try to make things different, push things around to make it feel more... you. \n\nI cried so many times during the film because I could relate to it and it was a moment where I knew, I wasn't alone and people who don't understand are possibly getting a glimpse as to what it feels like. \n\nAfter the film I bawled my eyes out because I am terrified and this film made me feel so many things that I have burried. \n\nEddie made me feel I wasn't alone and for that I am thankful.

Redmayne must have lost quite a bit of weight for this to happen. I was quite impressed with how this affected the fluidity of his transition between male and female.\n\nVikander was amazing and the best part of the movie along with the period setting.\n\nMy feelings towards Redmayne's character changed quite a bit throughout the movie. I initially felt sympathy because of how confused and clearly conflicted Wegener was but this quickly twisted into intense dislike over what a selfish fucking arsehole that Elbe/Wegener was turning into with regards to the affair with Henrik and the treatment of Gerda. Yes, you can be deeply conflicted and emotionally distraught over your issues with your own gender identity and sexuality but that doesn't give you permission to cheat on your wife and treat her like shit. Then it turns to sympathy again after the attack and the continued confusion, and emotional unraveling at the various doctors. Then, after the first surgery, it turns to a blend of both. I'm sympathetic to Lili's plight but hate what a selfish cow she is being, especially towards Gerda, the woman who has supported her through everything else. This pretty much continued up until the end of the movie. I felt bad for her but this was diminished by her selfish behaviour towards Gerda.\n\nDecent movie but not one I'd really watch again. 6/10.

There's another where Vikander and Matthias are walking down a long train station or something. Some shots were just completely amazing. But that's where it ended for me. \n\nLike many bio-pics, I felt that it was too long and covered too much. It was a little over the place and many interesting bits were glossed over.

", "While I enjoyed a lot of aspects of the movie (the acting, the general look, the score), parts of the story really bothered me, even if they were based on a true story.  Mainly, this movie really supports homophobic fear that boys doing feminine things will turn them gay.  I know Lili states that she was always like that, but the movie doesn't really support that idea. Redmayne starts as a happily straight man who gets stirrings of male attraction after playing dress up.  Even his childhood gay experience took place after playing dress up in his grandmother's apron.  The sort of people who fear that letting their 3 year old son play with a doll will turn him gay will probably relate to the start of the movie.  Then after the transition, Lili is extremely selfish and rude to Gerta, and the movie does not seem to disagree with the way Gerta is treated, only caring about how Lili feels. While clearly the story is on the surface \"about\" Lili, this part of the story does not exactly promote modern ideals about how transitioned people are good people, since the main \"good\" person of the movie is the caring wife, and in no way the transitioned person.

Alicia's performance as the supportive yet devastated wife all but solidified her rise to the top tier of Hollywood actresses and IMO, she absolutely deserves the Best Supporting Oscar she's nominated for. \n\nThe pacing felt a little weird throughout but I think Hooper did an adequate job at telling this story, I just don't think it was the best version of this story to tell.

There's a scene at the end that I really don't think you'd see in most other films about middle eastern conflicts. \n\nI wish they spent more time on the other contractors rather than mostly on John Krasinski and James Badge Dale's characters, though.\n\nOh, and Jim definitely does badass well.

The cinematography was very good, lots of wide spanning overhead shots of the beautiful rugged landscapes and architecture of Morocco and Malta. \n\nThe writing and character development were just OK. I don't expect any Oscar nominations, but it wasn't laughably bad or cringe inducing. Just a teaspoon of 'Murica here and there. \n\nUltimately 13 hours told a very intense story of something I knew very little about going in.

Firstly about how this movie would portray the events from a political perspective, as I did not want to see my brother\u2019s sacrifice boil down to political propaganda. On this front the movie excelled. No political figureheads were mentioned by name, and any political conclusions would have to be drawn by the viewer. I was also worried about how my brother was portrayed, on that front the movie did a great job, and it was obvious that input from the other special forces who were on the ground was taken seriously.\n\nThis movie had everything that you would want from a war movie. The action was good, but chaotic in places, which is to be expected considering the situations in which the firefight occurred. There was also a great attention to accuracy, and the specifics were thuroughly researched by Bay and his team. Talking to him after the premier, he basically told me that he was conservative in what he put on screen and didn't include any events that he could not concretely verify. In my conversations with people who were on the \n\nThe movie also did a good job of showing the emotions of the soldiers on the roof that night, which was what hit me personally the hardest, hearing the thoughts that were running through their minds when they didn\u2019t know how much longer they had.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t recommend this movie highly enough, and I apologize for the sloppy wording and potential incoherency of this post, but I can only say that I was more than satisfied with how the movie portrayed the events.

The shaky cam was ridiculous and the general character building elements were too hammy.

WAY better than American Sniper, but it seemed a little too \"black and white\" for my tastes.

This film is on the mediocre/poor end of the scale. The beginning tries to paint all the characters in a light that is supposed to make them seem both macho and also layered/nuanced in a sensitive and modern way, but only succeeds in making the characters seem absurd. \n\nI'm surprised that people are speaking positively of the action. Most of the time you can't really tell who is shooting at who, who that was who just got shot, why this team of supposedly highly trained operatives are just allowing themselves to be surrounded by mystery guys casually walking around with assault rifles, occasionally wondering if they are supposed to be \"friendly\" or not. Perhaps they were trying to portray the confusion of the actual events, but it isn't really done in a way that adds to the narrative at all. You get through a 20 minute scene of non-stop action wondering if this movie is going to even have a point.\n\nThe lives of the american characters are implicitly given much more weight than any of the locals, even the ones that are supposed to be on their side. The film trips over itself constantly trying to drive home the point about what magnificent and tastefully-flawed heroes these are.\n\nEverything is too gritty and shiny and there is too much fucking blue and green lighting. There is a surreal part where an armored car is being shot at from all sides at point blank range, with a gunman in the street putting his hand on the hood of the car while the american driver revs his engine, and you have to ask, why aren't they moving? Is that guy actually holding back a car with one hand? All the other passengers in the car are frantically yelling at the driver to go, and you might start to question whether that kind of advice should really be necessary. The indecision of the driver is almost comical. The mercedes logo is emblazoned prominently during the whole ordeal in a not-so-subtle product placement stunt, adding to the bizarreness of the whole scene.\n\nI get the sense that the people who enjoyed this film are the ones who will enjoy anything that is shiny and loud and busy enough.

This took away the unique atmosphere in the forest itself. If the world outside the forest is just as scary as the forest then what makes the forest so special?\n\nMy main critique would be Natalie Dormer as Sara and Jess.

I'm not talking about 3-4 either, it's like there are really upwards of 10 (maybe a slight exaggeration) moments where the film tries to use a \"scary\" ghost to suddenly jump at the screen to scare you. It really made the entire thing feel cheap and low-quality.\n\n2.

Yeah, we see that she brought a tent and supplies, but this is a place where people go to die (sometimes; it's sad that those who bring supplies like she did may merely be contemplating it and not go through with the deed). With everything that happens, it seems odd that she wouldn't succumb like Sara did (who, I may add, was only there for essentially a day, day and a half).\n\nIt has a very made-for-TV feel to it; had they knocked off the cheap scares and maybe tried to slow the pace down and work on character development and story it could've been so much more.\n\nUnfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. *Maybe* a watch on its eventual release on Netflix, but even then, you could find much better horror movies to spend an hour and a half on.", "Well, first film of 2016, and first shit of 2016.

Most choreographed fight scenes include theatrical martial arts and the characters taking hits and continuing fighting without a problem, but not here; right from the start with the Arikara ambushing the trappers with arrows silently finding throats to the incredibly brutal bear attack and then culminating with the end fight scene.  All were so amazingly gruesome and gritty that made me and the audience verbally exclaim with every hatchet swing.  The last fight scene was pure gold; from the hatchet chop catching Fitzgerald's two fingers to Glass's hand getting pinned by Fitz's knife, it was vicious and long, really nailing home that both characters were exhausted but determined to kill the other.  It was so believable too, with both characters stumbling over each other to gain control of the knife, clawing and biting to get on top of the other; it was clumsy and bloody, like a real fight would be.

Man against the elements, but man against his own nature, that is often violent and extreme. This film showed \"The White Men\" and Native Americans brutalizing not only each other, and the beautiful nature around them. The ONLY character that ever acknowledged an animal death was Glass, after he was \"birthed\" from the horse's carcass.\n\nIf this film suffers from anything, it was from trying to be an elaborate piece of art, taking on multiple issues, rather than just a \"western revenge/survival film.\" I can't fault it for that, the result was spectacular.\n\nPlus, what a cast!

The bear attack had me writhing in my seat and the fight at the end had me verbally saying \"oh shit\" and \"ow\" everytime a hand got stabbed or when Fitz' fingers get chopped off. On that note, I'd like to point out the almost seamless way he directs these action sequences. They seem to flow and maintain very interesting and steady camera movement which surprisingly adds to the realism. I think I feel more into it when there's less cuts, almost as if you're watching the fight go down in person, as opposed to tons of cutting on the action(which has been done superbly before). I guess it's just a style I like. Another aspect I enjoyed was the way he developed characters and created scenes where I genuinely give a shit about the characters I'm watching. This is the first time in awhile I have actually felt for a character like I felt for Glass when he watched his son die. I almost cried when he laid next to his frozen body. I think that part of the development was done very well and it made me want to Hardy's character die even more. While it wasn't a perfect film, the writing was excellent and at sometimes even clever, the acting was top notch(I was surprised by many of the great performances in this movie), and the cinematography and direction was top fucking notch.

It really communicated the unforgiving conditions, and the vastness of the wilderness and its unpredictability.\n\nTom Hardy was the standout performance for me, he slipped into that character so damn well. I thought the film played to Leo's strengths, as he seems to be at his best when he can get very intense and scream and carry on. To tell you the truth, I wasn't very hot on the casting at the beginning of the film but soon warmed to each performance. \n\nI'm not easily put off or taken aback by violence but I enjoyed the reactions of the people around me in my cinema. \n\nAs far as the Oscars go, I need to see the other *Oscar* films as most of them aren't released yet in Australia and the screeners aren't enticing because I hate DVD quality; Blu Rays have spoiled me. Before this film my pick for cinematography was Roger Deakins' work on Sicario but The Revenant blows it out of the water. I'd rather see Hardy win for best supporting actor than Leo win best lead. It should be a top contender for directing and cinematography, no doubt.\n\nAnd one last thing, the first 20 minutes of the film are unbelievable. It's total pandemonium executed spectacularly. ", "I noticed an interesting parallel between Glass and the bear. After the mauling, Glass wears the bear skin and holds the bear claws. His behavior when he catches/eats the fish reminded me of a bear doing as such. The bear was defending its cubs, and Glass was retaliating for the death of his \"cub\".

If you are expecting suspense from every source of art you partake in soon enough you will be disappointed. There is a limited amount of stuff that can astound us.

To prevent gangrene, Glass laid his wounded back on a rotting log and let maggots eat the dead flesh.\nGlass crawled overland south toward the Cheyenne River using Thunder Butte as a navigational tool, where he fashioned a crude raft and floated downstream to Fort Kiowa. The journey took him six weeks. He survived mostly on wild berries and roots; on one occasion he was able to drive two wolves from a downed bison calf, and feast on the meat. Glass was aided by friendly Native Americans who sewed a bear hide to his back to cover the exposed wounds and provided him with food and weapons.\"", "I love the fact that they didn't push the whole \"noble savage\" bs that a lot of films that involve Native Americans do.\n\nYeah, they did horrible shit as well to survive.

Being attacked by a wild animal could actually happen.\" \n\nI was so terrified by it, I did something I hardly ever do in a movie. I put my hands up in front of my face for a couple seconds. Like I was a little kid seeing a horror movie for the first time. Wow. ", "For the skeptics of this movie, let me clear some shit up.\nFirst of all, no. Tom Hardy did not do better than Leo. He was fantastic, but Leo killed it. I think a lot of us aren't used to physical acting these days, but the amount of things Leo said with only his eyes was amazing. For me, he won the oscar in the scene when he returns to camp and is talking with Gleeson. His eyes, his gaunt face, etc. Absolutely haunting from DiCaprio, he killed it. \n\nAs for how long it is, the weird dream sequences, the violence, etc, the movie was supposed to challenge the viewer. It's supposed to feel like a marathon. You're supposed to feel sick watching the bear scene. I think The Revenant did as good a job of putting you right there in the characters' shoes as any movie ever. The cinematography is gorgeous, and it further drives along the whole \"this land is beautiful but it was not meant to be tamed\" thing. Ultimately, it's about a man who takes more than a man should be able to take, and while it is difficult to sit through I think that is 100% intentional. Most movies don't leave you shaken up, or contemplating what in your life is important to you. I think people are overlooking a lot of these finer details that went into the final cut. By the end of the film, it feels like the character Hugh Glass and the viewer have gone through something together.\n\n I think it's a masterpiece from just about any point of view. I also think people are slagging it off because it's not the film they're used to. This is much closer to an arthouse film than it is a blockbuster or an epic. It's something to contemplate for days after having watched it. How did they survive back then? How much do I really take for granted on a daily basis? What does drive someone to live? There's also a fair bit said about god that regardless of your belief system is worth thinking about. ", "One of my favorite movies of all time.

Days after seeing the revenant, i am still thinking about it and trying to study and take it apart. It already has become one of my favorite movies of all time. It's a shame that a lot of people don't understand or can't understand this movie and i think it's because they don't want to put in the effort. We live in a very hyperactive society and it has become hard for people to process things and think. In no way did i find this movie boring or long. It is a masterpiece. Some people will look at famous artwork for a few seconds or minutes at best and become bored and disinterested, others will spend hours looking at it and those hours won't be enough.\n\nThere isn't much dialogue in this movie but it speaks and communicates in other ways. Not much is said but a lot can be understood. It has many layers. I have only seen it once and will have to see it again to see what i missed, i am very sure there is a whole lot more than what i will touch on, but i did some research and read some other opinions and reviews.\n\nI just want to INTRODUCE some of my thoughts, the themes, symbolism, and other things about and in this movie and let others EXPAND on them. \n\nThis is gonna be kinda messy and confusing but i'll try with the time i got. I'll try to present some ideas, theories, and thoughts of others that i don't necessarily agree with:::\n\n-Like the other films of Inarritu, this one is filled with themes of and references to religion(Inarritu seems to be a loose catholic)pain, suffering, existence, etc. basicly there seem to be a lot of philosophical themes.\n\n- There is a lot of Native American reference.\n\n- A teaser poster defined a revenant as \"one who has returned as if from the dead.\" other definitions have a supernatural element to it and define it as \"a visible ghost or spirit that returns after death.\" Both seem to fit.\n\n- Racism is a theme.\n\n-man vs nature. We see the cycle of life or survival of fittest in this movie. Especially when wolves attack buffalo and then man attacks/scares away the wolves and eats, i guess signifying man as greater than animals.\n\n-Man vs God/atheism. I guess this is set in a time when almost everyone knew or was part of a type of cultural christianity. Fitz seems to be an atheist- god was squirrel; he ate squirrel-meaning man is greater than God or modern world consumed or took over God or he, Fitz, is god- he is shown as selfish, and caring for mainly himself. Yet Fitz talks a lot about religion and \"lord\" in a believing way. But Fitz and his ideas are presented, in a way, as bad/wrong/leading to destruction and removal of morality, screwed up ethics, etc.\n\n-youthful innocence vs brutal, cold, messed up adult life- the kid was shown as having compassion towards older woman by giving her his valuable food. Whereas Fitz was opposite and with his talks with the kid kind of influenced him and tried to change his way of thinking.\n\n-Man as animal- Glass as bear, wolve, horse. Glass wearing bear fur and claws for most of movie but loses? it after fall off cliff. Humans seem to act like animals. When Glass crawls up to Native American begging for food reminded me of some animal, i think wolf, doing that(without the pointing at mouth stuff and talking), that i saw somewhere, i think some BBC nature show. Glass eating fish like bear.\n\n-resurrection, baptism, incarnation? referenced. Glass gets partially buried, Fitzgerald talks about baptism? Glass getting into horse(Leo actually got into real horse carcass)and then comes out.\n\n-Canteen with spiral symbol-associated with PANTHEISM-spirituality centered on nature, but also concept of evolution and growth- and surrender and release- Glass does at end- surrenders to God and release/lets go of revenge and family?.\n\n- Native American hanged with sign saying: \"we(the native americans? or we humans?)are all savages\"\n\n- fallen nature/sinful nature of man/ chaos, pain, suffering, caused by man. Basically the problem is man, our state, and ways of life. This is something Inarritu talks about in his interviews, that we, as people are very messed up and do very messed up stuff. This ties in with his views on a need for God.\n\n-there is a lot of bird stuff. Glass' son's name is Hawk, in dreams: son is holding black bird, wife has bird come out of bullet wound in chest, birds after attack scene circling above, black bird looking at Glass after he passes out from trying to close throat wound, and finally near the end there is bird nest in a tree.\n\n-Glass wears a bear paw/claws. Some Native Americans believed that bears had spiritual power and wearing a bear paw/claw meant protection and healing for the person.\n\n-native americans as angels protecting garden of eden, earth.\n\n- The flashbacks are called dream sequences by people part of movie in interviews so that's what we'll call them. The dream sequence of buffalo skulls- inarritu wanted human skulls to represent the demise of Native Americans but it was suggested to him to do buffalo skulls instead because people were encouraged to kill buffalo to take away food source from native americans so it represents demise of animal life as well as human as result of animal.\n\n-church dream sequence- church was built for movie- inspired by Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrie Rublev. Church bell was specifically asked for by inarritu and didn't make sound-??. The paintings center on Jesus and the cross plus there are paintings of people killing the Native Americans- i guess saying that these \"Christians\" weren't authentic Christians because the cross and Jesus teach the opposite. .I think since dreams are internal-part of our memories/past/exposure to this and things in this world, that Glass was a religious man(christian?). Then we see Glass standing before the cross and then his son Hawk appears and gets between Glass and the cross/FORGIVENESS- i guess saying that his son is in the way of forgiveness for Glass. One person i asked said that it was his faith that was broken or failed him-broken up church building. Another view is that nature or evolution has taken over religion.\n\n-friendship- Glass+Native American. Glass viewed him as a type of savior of his whereas the french saw him as a savage and worthless.\n\n-what about comet/meteor?\n\n-what about avalanche(was caused intentionally by helicopter at needed time)?\n\n-nature as chaotic/unpredictable or responsive to human violence or death- trees shaking violently after death of Hawk? avalanche during fight, i think there's another one i forgot.\n\n-Glass puts moss in dead son's mouth?- i guess ritual.\n\n-Did Glass really blink when asked by Fitz-it looked like he accepted it in one way- or did he mean it as not a blink- not normal speed or length of time closed.\n\n-some think Glass died when he fell off cliff and rest is just a dream\n\n-When Glass (Dicaprio) battles with the bear he initially injures it with a gunshot wound to it's left side until finally defeating it with multiple stab wounds. This is mirrored in the final showdown with Fitzgerald (Hardy) in which Glass shoots him in his left shoulder but ultimately defeats him with a knife.\n\n-Did Glass really leave Fitz up to God's(Glass says God whereas Native American said creator) hands or not? Because it seemed like he sent him to the Native Americans.\n\n- Some don't like the whole son story. I think there is something personal behind it for Inarritu::Inarritu's faith was most tested in 1996, when a son died two days after birth from medical complications. The father of two other children, Inarritu wanted to take revenge on the doctors who oversaw his son's treatment, but ultimately resisted his violent instincts.\n\"I felt the doctors didn't really talk to me in advance, and they didn't take the necessary\" precautions to prevent the death, he says, gesticulating. \"The reason my kid died is very complicated. When I began to investigate it, I began to plan things -- and how I (could) damage those guys. Suddenly I realized, by a very tough process, that nothing will bring my kid back. It's a very subjective world. And I just let it go. I had to find a way to let go. If not, you begin to get crazy.\" It seems Inarritu went through this process of wanting revenge and finally forgiving and putting things in God's hands. He understands and maybe others do as well.\n\n-why was his wife turning away and walking away from him at end- didn't seem like a dream. Plus what was she saying?\n\n- the ending- Glass looks at audience, or camera pans into him and makes it seem like it, and breathing into credits. Connected to him telling his son:as long as you have breath keep moving or surviving or something like that. For me, with connection with fog and blood getting on camera and the director wanting the audience engaged as much as possible, it connected our world with his and kind of i guess saying \"this is our world.\" or??\n\n-Glass looks at audience.2.Plus, this is far fetched but i'll include it anyway- there is the Native American legend of a skin-walker- is a person with the natural ability to turn into any animal he or she desires. To be able to transform, legend sometimes requires that the skin-walker wears a pelt of the animal-The Navajo believe that if you ever LOCK EYES with a skinwalker, they can project themselves into your body. Alternately, some Navajos believe that if you make EYE CONTACT with a skinwalker, your body will freeze up due to the fear of them and the skinwalker will use that fear to gain power and energy.\n\n-Sorry it's messy and all over the place. I didn't go in depth but there's a bunch more to talk about. Add it below.", "I just got home from the theater and Reddit was the first place I came.

So I'm disappointed that so many comments consist of whiny, nit-picky remarks that totally miss the point and have nothing to do with the substance of the film.\n\nThis film took many months to shoot and only used natural light on location and you are going to bitch that in one scene snow was falling and the next it was melting?  Films are human endeavors, there are logistical issues, and if you can't get over a little discordance between shots then you really probably can't enjoy any film that is not shot on a carefully controlled green screen.\n\nFor those who are bothered that it took so long to get to the climax and that we just kept seeing shots of Leo dragging his ass through the snow, you missed the point.  This film is an existential journey, and, cliche as it sounds, the journey is more important than the destination. Inarritu wanted to show us the immense, desperate, long, drawn out, dirty, cold journey that is Glass's survival.  He wanted us to be forced to watch, forced to watch it in all of its brutality.  I don't know about you, but I didn't pay $11.75 tonight to go see some tidy Star Wars movie with lots of strange and exciting locations and characters to keep my attention.  I wanted to see something harsh, epic, long, and beautiful.\n\nInarritu's direction is phenomenal.  His long signature tracking shots and \"no-cuts\" really give the film vibrance and movement and dynamism, especially in battle scenes.  I loved his use of surreal elements and dream sequences.  I also loved the tight shots of Leo's face and the intimacy given to his expressions, all blended with and contrasted against the vast wasteland.  \n\nAnd this leads to DiCaprio.  Anyone who complains that he just grunted and spat doesn't really get it.  The high degree of physicality, the nuance and intensity of his expressions, the hours everyday spent on location: this guy worked his ass off.  Only a great actor could pull off such a visceral performance without looking totally cheesy and overly effusive.  When a camera is right in your face, showing every little detail, and you have to act intensely without dialogue...yeah, I'd like to see you try it.  \n\nGreat films push us, breaking expectations and refusing easy resolutions.  My thoughts on 'The Revenant' remain underdeveloped, but without question I think it's a film that deserves quite a bit of respect.  It also deserves better critiques than: \"What the hell, the ice was melted and then it wasn't melted...\"", "[deleted]", "I felt the cold during this ", "I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the meteor falling towards Earth in the one dream sequence. The same image is in Birdman. Coincidence? I think not.

Even the Native American stuff was barely scratching the surface. I wasn't buying any chemistry between Leo and his son, and found  the movie pretty lifeless because of this. The scenes were awesomely beautiful and viseral, and I did want to see Leo get his revenge because Tom Hardy portrayed such a great villain, but Leo did not get to me at all.\n\nFor some reason I also found myself comparing the movie to True Grit (Cohen brothers version): it's a movie set in the backdrop of old Americana, but the characters and religious backdrops are just so more interesting to watch.", "Haven't seen anyone mention it, so here goes: I thought the score was pretty great in this movie. The silence in between really made some scenes really great.

I was on edge the whole time.\n", "Absolutely incredible movie...5/5. The cinematography alone is worth the price of admission. ", "I hate to say this but I felt like Hardy deserves a Oscar nod over Leo. That man can just disappear so deeply into a role you forget about the  Actor. For some reason, Leo struggles with that aspect as an actor. I always feel like I'm \"rooting for Leo\" rather than losing myself in his story arcs. \n\nThe constant Death/Rebirth scenes were strong but thats more about the Director and Cinematographer than Leo.", "Tom Hardy's biggest role yet for me. \n\ni could feel the fire rise in all of his scenes.", "The final fight between Glass and Fitzgerald might be one of the most intense fight scenes I've ever seen.

Oh my God!", "Is it just me or is Tom Hardy's accent super hard to understand?", "[deleted]", "This movie was literally tailor made for me. The opening quote about keep breathing and don't give up resonates with me so much. My favorite theme to movies. Then the beautiful all natural lighting at the beginning when they shoot the moose. I absolutely love nature movies.  Then we get to see Tom Hardy start complaining about the gunshot and see the primal nature of the fur traders. Being from Oklahoma, and remembering football camp, that's exactly like what a bunch of guys act like without women haha. As they're giving bridger crap, I could totally relate. I'm thinking they totally got this right, then the arrow goes through the dudes neck.  Then the attack at the beginning. I absolutely love extended scenes. I love the gore. I love the realisticness of the battle. There wasn't any choreographed long sword fight. Glass swings his rifle and misses, next thing you know he's being choked to death and just gets lucky that someone saved him. literally the best opening a movie has ever had. I think it put such a positive attitude on the rest of the movie. When I walked out of the theater, I already knew it was my favorite movie of all time. I've watched it three times by myself in the theater, it's that good. And each time I understand Tom Hardy's accent better. Also I thought Tom Hardy stole the show and if anyone deserves an Oscar, it's him.", "I don't know why, but I found it hilarious when the people searching for the girl kept randomly popping up and interfering with the plot.", "It says in the summary that glass was guided by will and love of his family....I think he was motivated by desire for revenge.  What do you guys think?", "Finally saw it for the first time and I wish I had gone to see it in the theater, cause it was beautiful and very immersive. But even without the big screen it was a great movie. Definitely deserves the praise it gets.", "The obvious:\n\nExcellent performances. Excellent cinematography (most likely wins the Oscar). Excellent score. Excellent themes throughout. \n\nThe one thing that bothers me about this conversation is the complaint of running time. Sure, the film was a bit long and the nature specific shots most likely could have been cut down to trim running length but for me **the running time of the film was the point**. \n\nI think the film is at its length to showcase just how long Glass was out there fighting for his life. The silence of the film only helps underscore the narrative of a sole man, tormented by loss, fighting to live in the face of all odds. For me, **the length was the point**.", "Of course Andy Serkis was the bear ", "Does anyone have an explanation for the random meteor halfway through the movie? There was one in Birdman as well, at the very beginning. Does this director have some sort of meteor fetish, or is there some symbolism I'm not getting?", "How bout when he crawled up to his son and his breath was fogging the camera lens? That was pretty jarring. Like this movie is dripping with atmosphere and crisp camerawork, but that moment, which I'm sure was intentional, kind of broke me from willful suspension. To be honest it kind of felt like I was right there with him in that moment, right there crawled up onto his dead kid while he broke down, except I was separated by a sheet of glass. Odd move. There were a few odd moves in this one.", "Overall I thought the movie was really good, though a bit slow in the middle. One of my favorite parts besides the obvious (opening battle, bear attack, etc.) was how Domhnall reacted to finding Glass alive and immediately started looking to arrest Hardy.", "When the bear's breathed fogged the camera lens.\n\nshockingly great effects.", "This was an incredible movie, the shot where glass rests his head on his son's chest and is breathing heavily followed by a cut to a sun being obscured by clouds, with leos breathing being the only sound in the cinema. what an shot.", "The camera work during the opening attacking scene was superb, the bear attack was very hard to watch, considering how real it looked. Could go on forever, in short I appreciate everyone's work in this movie.", "I feel like the hatred of this movie is coming from people that wanted it to be a Quentin Tarantino movie. I LOVE Tarantino but this was a different kind of movie by a different kinda director. I loved The Revenant for what it was.", "Anyone else notice the nod to Birdman when the heavenly body or shooting star plummets to Earth? I am trying to remember when in the storyline it happened and if there is any significance. \n\nAs for the ending, it's open to interpretation. Glass says \"all he had was his son\" and Fitzgerald says \"nothing can bring his son back.\" There is no way of knowing if the final breath was his last breath or his breath continuing. These open endings are not uncommon and are somewhat forced artistry to me. The reality is this story is based in truth, so we can probably figure this ending out, right? \n\nI challenge you all to consider the use of the word \"savages\" as a an insight to the historical framework of the film. This was a polarizing word specifically used in French encyclopedias. Thematically speaking this word choice invites a discussion of \"man vs. savage\" and makes one question where this conflict echoes the deep theme of revenge being only the work of God, not man. In our quest for revenge, our most savage qualities are amplified. We see revenge visited my almost every character and I think this is a more significant thread to consider than man vs. nature. \n\nVisually the landscape bounces from majestic to stark. This is a metaphor for man's soul being both expansive and depleted simultaneously. The dark river framing the story evokes both mystery and surrender, both spiritually connected. \n\nGlad you all took this film as seriously deserved. What a great year for film, although I am a little upset certain actors are speaking of a lack of diversity when this Best Picture hopeful prominently features Native Americans. Do they not count as diversity? Talk about oppression! But alas, that is for another forum. Here is hoping both DiCaprio and Hardy win in a month.", "[deleted]", "Really good cast, cinematography was amazing, and even though Leonardo grunted throughout the entire movie you still got the... Imma get this fucker no matter what, oh fuck, don't die, shit, gotta keep going, found the bitch! dialogue. \n\nThings I noticed: casting for Native American girls, they weren't Disney's Pochantas/Asian looking like a lot of movies of this genre. Maybe more authentic? And also, why do Captains always trust the guy who's trying to kill the main character? Is this a movie trope or something?", "Photography was about all the stood out for me in this film.\nIt wasn't a bad movie, the acting was on point, but it just wasn't particularly engaging.", "What a brutal movie.  I loved it.  I hear Mallick referenced a lot, and I can definitely see it.  It has the same poetic sensibility, but it also delivers the survival movie goods without being too sentimental about nature.\n\nI haven't been so cold in the theater since \"The Grey\".  It really tapped into something primal.  This is also a somewhat refreshing movie considering the homogenized sterile landscape that America has become these last few decades.  It's good to remember the fragility of civility.\n\nEdit:  Tom Hardy was believable and had eyes that matched the relentless indifference of the terrain.  Also, Leo really gave his body to the role, floating down cold rivers, crawling through freezing mud, maintaining the nuance of the role, but not distractedly so.  He definitely deserves the Oscar.\n", "[deleted]", "Domhnall Gleason killed it! He's become one of my favorite actors because of Frank, Ex Machina, and this.", "This movie had so many things that I've never seen before, and I absolutely loved it.\n\n* A vicious bear attack (Come to think of it, what's the last movie that had a bear attack in it at all? BRAVE doesn't count.)\n\n* An actor fixing a hole in their neck by pouring gasoline on it and lighting it on fire, all in one take\n\n* A freefall sequence off of a cliff where not only does the animal die, but they don't hesitate to show its snapped neck\n\n* An actor sleeping in a horse carcass overnight (made even more incredible by the fact that he actually did it in real life)\n\n* An actor eating raw bison liver\n\n* An actor chewing off someone's earlobe and spitting it at the camera\n\n* A movie shot using 100% only natural lighting\n\n* A fight sequence where a man's fingers are chopped off at the corner of the screen when you're least expecting it.

Beautiful production design, fantastic performances, near devastating movie.", "With all the hype of The Hateful Eight and 70 mm--which I loved--there's a quietly wonderful usage of 16 mm for this film. It's what results in that more grainy look throughout, and it really suits the film well. Kudos to Edward Lachman here.", "Loved pretty much everything about this movie. The score is one of my favorites of this year and every shot is just beautiful to look at and perfectly captures the 50s. Also, an Audrey Hepburn biopic starring Rooney Mara needs to happen. ", "Haynes' use of 16mm was really impressive, a much better example of the merits of shooting on film than something like Interstellar. \n\nThis also makes for an interesting comparison piece to the Duke Of Burgundy, another excellent movie released earlier in 2015. Both explore lesbian romances with actual depth, and know that sometimes there are better ways of exploring sex in film without simply showing it.\n\nIt's probably going to get a lot of \"Oscar Bait\" accusations because a lot of people think that any movie that deals with homosexuality is Oscar bait, which is a shame because it really is a very human story that's elevated by Haynes' direction and Lachman's cinematography. Contrast it with something like The Imitation Game or The Theory Of Everything, which are completely by-the-numbers movies that aren't interested in exploring their subjects at all but rather interested in getting awards, and you can see why Carol is a much more thoughtful movie.\n\n[Richard Brody's review of the movie for The New Yorker is a really great read, too.](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/carol-up-close) He sums up its merits much better than I could.", "I wanted this movie to do more. It felt so...cold. Anyone else think so? Aesthetically, however, it was BEAUTIFUL. Every shot looked like a painting. I left surprisingly disappointed, but still thought the movie was incredibly well-done. I think the fault, for me, lies more in the composition of the story than the execution of it. Also - SARAH PAULSON is always a good person to add to a cast. She's wonderful. ", "The thing I loved was its dream-like aesthetic, almost like you're trying to peer through a fog (mostly down to the 16mm). The lighting seemed to be a sort of DEFCON code for Carol and Therese's relationship. There's a recurring shot of Mara on either a train or in a car \u2013 the camera looking in from the outside through a window \u2013 with light beaming against raindrops trickling down the glass. Green light, I believe, when she is first picked up by Carol and whisked away to her New Jersey estate, now completely enamoured, and red at moments of doubt and separation (notably when she gets a lift to the party shown at the beginning and end of the film). It reminded me of when Loki is racing through traffic at the end of *Prisoners*.\n\nAnd I saw someone say they weren't blown away by Blanchett's performances. It's not really as raw a drama as *Blue Jasmine*, so the moments of conflict for the most part are quite nuanced and, on the whole, the film simmers along (typified by that middle finger to Chekhov when Carol confronts the PI). Think back to the scene between her and Mara at the restaurant at the end (rewatch it if you can) and watch Blanchett's eyes. Manages to convey so much emotion without having to really move her face.", "Best film I've seen in a very, very long time. Looked gorgeous, phenomenal acting, excellent chemistry.", "I absolutely loved this movie. The tension and buildup to them actually physically falling in Love was just beautiful. I read the book as well it does go deeper into their road trip and you actually are taken on the journey of their love. This movie is so simple when dealing with such a complex issue. \n\nAt times I felt like I was *watching* a poem. Cate Blanchett was intense and mesmerizing. Rooney was so fragile with a quiet confidence in her. Their chemistry was palpable. \n\nCate Blanchett surely will get an Oscar nod and probably win. Rooney will get the nomination but Alicia Vikar will get it for the Danish Girl. ", "Everyone's talking about Mara and Blanchett (with good reason), but I was blown away by Kyle Chandler. In what could have turned into quite a two-dimensional role, he really made me empathise with his character and understand his perspective. Just wanted to give him some love.", "Loved this film.  Yes, it's VERY quiet and subtle, and those looking for drama/action/intensity will be disappointed.  The film works because the script is so tight and the actors are impeccable.  The score was also amazing and worked so well with the film.  I thought Mara's performance was stellar, almost even better than Blanchett's.", "Undoubtedly one of my favourite movies of 2015. Just so bloody beautiful and compelling. ", "\"Carol\" is a sumptous yet subtle movie that is so packed with detail and subtext that it's impossible to get all of it in one viewing. I am not sure what people mean when they say it is \"cold\" or \"detached.\" I saw a movie full of passion and unspoken longing. One aspect that might seem strange to some is that neither Carol nor Therese directly discusses what is happening between them until the middle of the movie when Therese says \"Take me to bed.\" And what leads up to it is conveyed through body language, vocal inflection, and intense eye contact. There's a reason they call it the 'love that dare not speak its name.\" This was reality for gay people until only very recently. If you met someone and felt some kind of spark, the process of finding out whether they were open to a same sex relationship was extremely delicate, in addition to the usual stress of wondering if the other person feels the same way. This movie absolutely captured that dynamic, with both women inching closer to each other in each scene, the attraction between them building to an an almost unbearable level before they finally give in to it, in a perfectly timed, no-holds-barred love scene. I have the utmost respect for Blanchett and Mara for the way they completely gave themselves over to it and held nothing back in this astonishingly intimate scene. The love scene is the focal point of the film and absolutely essential to the story. It is a film about love and making love. Don't look for anything else in it! The \"Carol\" experience is not unlike going to an opera like \"La Boheme,\" a very simple plot, two lovers and their small circle of friends just trying to muddle through, all wrapped in Puccini's sublime and melancholy music. Maybe this film hits notes only lesbians can hear, but it hits them pitch-perfectly. It is a ravishing, poignant, and devastatingly beautiful film.", "This is easily my favorite movie of the year.\n\nCate Blanchett and Rooney Mara really knocked it out of the park, and both of them deserve any accolades they receive. Blanchett was intense, and layered in a way that had me questioning exactly how to read her. \n\nIt was so damn beautiful, too. I loved all of the shots through windows, and the dreamlike atmosphere when the movie took on Mara's point of view. \n\nIt's a lot more conventional than what I've come to expect from Haynes, but I believe that it works for the subject matter. I can't wait to revisit it.\n\nEDIT: By the way, if anyone can help me out, I'm trying to remember the exact wording of a quote I found particularly moving. It was from Carol's letter, something along the lines of, \"You demand resolutions and explanations because you're young.\" Thanks.", "I cannot get the image of Cate Blanchett peering out her head from the door after the shower.

I really enjoyed it. 8/10 for me.\n\nAs far as what I didn't like..\n\nKyle Chandler didn't fit the bill for me. I didn't think his performance was all that great. Just my opinion. \n\nAlso, I left the theater wanting more from their (Carol & Therese) relationship. \n\nTo wrap up on a high note..\n\nMara and Blanchett were phenomenal. Especially Mara. Her performance as a naive young girl was unbelievable. \n\nThe photography was incredible along with the set design. The music was perfect and the graininess of the film was perfect. ", "Carol has only now arrived in our area. I loved the book,The Price of Salt, and have ben eagerly waiting to see this film. Loved the score but it reminded me of Phillip Glass so much it was almost distracting because it was so familiar. But the last two minutes of the score was perfection imo. The two leads were mesmerizing to watch. Blanchette and Mara were off the charts good. So much of what is happening is unspoken. Restraint, longing, release, love, power, and powerless all sorts of good stuff in this quiet darkly lit movie. I think the lighting and the sets seemed muted a bit maybe to allow the performances to dominate. I loved it. I read that some of Browstein's And Paulson's scenes were cut.

This movie rides on her performance and her character blossoming. The last scene where you just see her staring at Carol was just perfect.", "Too quiet a movie to eat popcorn without disturbing your neighbors. Just so ya know.", "It dragged at points but when I left the theater I realized I really loved this movie. Reminded me of In the Mood For Love and The Master which is high praise from me.\n\nAlso I'm seriously in love with Rooney Mara after watching this.", "At the end I couldn't help but think how goofy it would be if the final shot was a helicopter shot of Carol and Therese looking at each other, a la 'The Force Awakens'.\n\n7/10 movie, I just feel like the whole movie was so distant from an emtional standpoint. I've been thinking a lot about it since I've seen it, though. I'm haunted by Therese's line that went along the lines of \"How do I know what I want if I say yes to everything?\"\n\nI wish Carrie Brownstein had more to do, though. She basically had a cameo.", "Honestly, I thought this was an absolute bore. It really doesn't have anything to do with this aiming to be a slow paced film (though this certainly doesn't help), but it had a lot to do with how little I cared about any of the characters and what was happening to them. \n\nI could never quite invest in the Carol and Therese relationship because I never really saw why they'd even be attracted to each other. I didn't find myself caring about Carol and the custody battle of her daughter because they hardly even have any scenes together. The male characters were also pretty one-dimensionally written and seemed cartoonishly unsympathetic. I guess it's a bit understandable that Kyle Chandler's character is upset at Carol, but he presents himself as so paranoid and confrontational (in front of a person he's just met, no less). I also thought the oppression of lesbian romance was approached very superficially for a film that seemed to rely on that aspect to provide the framework and general theme of its story.\n\nIt's a well-shot film with good performances from actors who you'd expect to give good performances. I just don't think it's particularly memorable or interesting.", "Excellent film - it's strange because I honestly can't pin what I thought was so compelling. ", "I loved the subtlety of this movie, how the aesthetic reflected the times. That's why it didn't bother me that so much was muted or unsaid and so many shots were actually through glass or mirrors. These people had to conceal themselves in plain sight.

Perhaps I expected a lot more from this film, the story is meh. Nonetheless, the music is great.", "[deleted]", "Love it. Very touching and beautifully filmed movie.

Could not believe the attraction between the two, particularly when compared to other films this year like Brooklyn or 45 Years. \n\nIt was all very well put together though. The camera work, the blocking, the image system were all very well done, and the attention to detail in the set and prop design were fantastic.  It just felt like it lacked heart. It felt like it was trying to create some artificial instead of tapping into real human emotions. Almost manipulative at times, like it was just ticking off boxes (lesbians, tick. period drama, tick. class issue, tick.) instead of trying to find some deep human truths.\n\nFor me it was the [16th best film of the year](https://medium.com/@felixjmorgan/the-30-best-films-of-2015-ae8ff46797a8#.24kdd2pbm). Not bad by any means, but less remarkable than the critics seem to be making out.\n\nIt would also be a travesty if Cate Blanchett takes the best actress Oscar when Brie Larson was so vastly superior in Room.

While the cinematography and production design and score is absolutely beautiful, I felt the film was a bit too emotionally detached to wholly invest me in the relationship.\n\nFor me, the pacing was glacially slow after the first 20 minutes or so. I feel like this movie ran out of new things to discover about the characters far too early on. Didn't really warrant the long stretches of time between the plot twists and conflict escalations.

I didn't really have an issue with the running time to be honest, and I only checked the time once toward the end of the film out of curiosity more than impatience with the film. Quick question for everyone. Did you guys think that Marquis really raped Smithers son?

Have to wonder what's eating QT to really focus on out-and-out hatred?\n\n2) This seems like it pays more homage to classic American fiction than classic American filmmaking techniques. From the bevy of coincidences that we're supposed to accept (very common in older literature) to the juxtaposition of open wilderness, claustrophobic haberdashery, the blizzard, the lies, the letters, this actually comes off as a very excellent example of American Gothic storytelling.\n\n3) I like many other people expected it to be about a bunch of bounty hunters caught in the same space fighting over a primo bounty.

Sam Jackson killed it. It's maybe because English is not my first language, but there is something really intriguing about the way he pronounce words like \"neither\" or \"on the other side\". And Goggins was great, too! Their final scene, where he is reading the Lincoln letter while they're dying is, in my opinion, the best ending of all Tarantino movies. \n\nMany are criticising the violence, but if you watch shows like Game of Thrones or Hannibal, it's really not that excessive. \n\nI am especially happy for Jennifer Jason Leigh for starring in two high class movies this year (the other one being Charlie Kaufman's Anomalisa). \n\nOverall I would say 8/10.

It's a Tarantino film so it still stands strong based on things Tarantino does well, but I felt like it underutilized most of its cast, and nothing in it really... stood out to me. It was passable all the way through, whereas most Tarantino films have one or two sequences that really stand out and define the film. I don't feel like this movie had that. The one scene that could have been that, Jackson's recounting of his encounter with Dern's son, was deflated by the use of intercutting scenes showing what Jackson was describing. In fact, the whole movie seemed to be riddled with \"show, don't tell\" (like what the fuck was up with that narration? It makes sense if it was after intermission, but it was out of place and mostly useless). Showing hasn't always been Tarantino's strong suit, his dialogue has always been exposition heavy, but here it wasn't as snappy as it's been.

It was thematic, original, and set the tone of the movie and I hope Ennio Morricone gets some nod for soundtrack because, holy shit, it was so fantastic. I loved Bob, loved Daisy Domergue, loved Chis Mannix, but thats about it. I felt the movie plodded along and had a predictable Tarantino ending. Did everyone effectively kill each other? Check. Was there an obscenely amount of gore/violence so much so that it was a parody of itself? Check. There was fantastic cinematography, set design, and the fluttering of snow falling into the frame felt authentic and immersed me in the world. The characters were just ok, but I appreciated the break from obvious good vs. evil as each character had ambiguous prerogative.

", "Spectacular. I am admittedly a huge Tarantino fan but this movie was fantastic. Great characters, I loved all the chapters.  I honestly loved the beginning and the stagecoach scenes. The wailing wind throughout the movie added to the brutality of the weather. Weather is almost a character and not just a plot device. Did anyone else enjoy Tarantino as the narrator?", "I'm going to go against the tide and say as someone who has enjoyed all of QT's films I did NOT like this film. I felt that it never really found itself and wanted to be too many things at once. I thought the first half set up a good western, but then the second half just dropped off. I might need to give it a second watch, but for the first time through I was not impressed. Was it an alright film? Yeah. Was it a good QT film? Not really.", "Bob The Mexican is one of the best characters from all of Tarantino's work. Demian Bichir barely let us into his head all the way up the outlaws being revealed. His common sense questions and one-liners, and his frustrated and eventually perfected piano solo was priceless.\n\nOut of all the outlaws, he was the most ruthless; suggesting the General's authenticity and then stabbing Sweet Dave multiple times, followed by gun-blasting Minnie's aid into hiding. Just top-notch character, and funny as hell.", "Just wondering if I missed something in the movie... \n\nHow did/could Oswaldo produce the execution papers for the previous sheriff when Mannix asked to see it?\n\nAnd didn't Mannix read some parts of it out loud?", "I see QT-s use of (somehow misplaced) slo-mo as just one of his homages to classic film-making techniques (which were also showcased by Jean Luc Godard, who happens to be one of QT's influences).Remember rear projection in Pulp Fiction's cab scene? :)", "While it is entertaining, the dialogue is definitely not up to par with what Tarantino has produced in the past. The first half of the film is essentially just a bunch of exposition; everyone is sitting around talking about what they did in the past to become who they are now. Now this is fine if the dialogue is funny, witty, typical Tarantino. But in this film, the dialogue is stilted. None of these people trust each other so of course there isn't going to be a natural flow to their conversations but there is also a lack of nuance that I see being a hindrance to repeat viewings. It's a lot of backstory and exposition. I heard someone describe it as a \"first draft,\" which rings true in my ears. The ideas are there but not the finesse.\n\nThe narration was probably some sort of homage to some old movie but in this film, it just felt so lazy. Why tell us about the poison using voice over? It's completely unnecessary and ruins what could have been a really fun surprise when two characters start vomiting blood suddenly.\n\nThe Minnie flashback is a miss. It's difficult to feel empathetic towards such caricatures as these saccharine sweet characters. A lot of characters were similarly one-note. In a three hour film featuring a handful of characters, you'd expect some more depth to these people. I get that Tarantino is trying to make everyone a caricature but I don't accept it as an excuse for thin characters.\n\nSamuel L Jackson's big speech revealing everything he's figured out at gunpoint is entertaining only because he delivers monologues like nobody's business. But from a writing standpoint, how lazy is that? You have this contrived whodunnit scenario that this character start breaking down pretty much immediately after it is set up.\nFurthermore, Tarantino uses 70mm film but doesn't take this as an opportunity to direct interesting blocking of characters in the background. I mentioned the lazy narration of the poisoned coffee. Instead of that, it would have been interesting to have a wide shot of Samuel L Jackson talking while a character in the background fiddles with the coffee pot and Daisy watches, for example.\n\nIn short, The Hateful Eight has memorable moments, such as the Samuel L Jackson's blowjob monologue and Daisy's constant abuse. But it does not meet expectations we've come to expect from Tarantino's dialogue and writing.", "Did anyone else find the narration scene a bit jarring/out of place? I feel like we were built up to this subtle plot for the first hour and a half of the movie with great character development and then it's all just explained bluntly", "I am having trouble with a few aspects of the film. Since I am doing a reddit discussion, must be the movie did it's job though. First of all, I liked it, didn't love it. I knew what to expect from the movie and I think I got what i expected. But maybe I got a little less based on these elements: \n\n-Mobray purported to be \"The Hangman\" and handed Ruth a business card. I just found it a little misleading to the audience. Would have been better to have to take him at his word, like we had to do with the sheriff.\n\n-Ruth and Warren seemed to know everything about everyone, but had no idea Domergue had a gang, nor any of the members. This is mainly a problem for Ruth. He found Daisy and thought she was just an independent murderer.\n\n-Warren said Minnie hated Mexicans, but there was no reference to that when they did one of the myriad of flashbacks\n\n-I can accept tons of things when watching Tarantino---and I enjoy almost ALL Tarantino films, but there seemed to be a lot of clean-up of blood and dead bodies in the 4 hours before Ruth arrived at Minnie's Haberdashery. It's a small tidbit, totally plausible-Tarantino is rarely about what is plausible-but it took something away for me. Instead we got one red jelly bean on the floor.\n\n-Tarantino has earned the right to do whatever he wants in film, but for me, the narration was a cop-out and cheap. If I submitted that in a  film class I would be laughed at as an amateur. \n\n\nI think a 75% on rottentomatoes is about right. It could have been so much better though. \n\n", "Quentin has said that Team America was one of his favorite movies, and I was reminded of [this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKqGXeX9LhQ)", "I absolutely loved the first half of this movie. Zero qualms. It was a pure masterclass in buildup, using humor, tension and reveals of character backstory to wonderful effect.\n\nOnce it got knee-deep into Chapter 4 and people started dying horribly, I was... not quite so into it. It just had this really disturbing focus on sadistically awful violence and suffering that didn't seem necessary to the story that had been told for the last 90 minutes. Aside from the hilarious dark humor in juxtaposing the happy-go-lucky residents of Minnie's haberdashery with impending bloodshed in the *Four Passengers* flashback (Chapter 5, I think?) I was let down by the back half of the film. Still a pretty stunning piece of work due to the amazing performances and cinematography.", "I don't think I was in the right frame of mind when I watched it because it like such a letdown. \n\nI mean I like pretty much all of his films and his last two are easily some of my favourite movies but I felt like this just took too long to get going and ultimately I lost interest by the hour mark. \n\nMaybe I just need to watch it again when I feel like I'm in a better frame of mind but right now, I feel like it was nowhere near as good as I hoped. ", "I did not expect that much penis. That's basically my only takeaway from the film.", "I react the same way as John Ruth when I drink bad coffee. ", "Anyone get a weird Jodorowsky \"The Holy Mountain\" vibe during the whole BJ scene?  \n\nIt was the only part of the movie that felt like it was directed by someone else, and maybe Tarantino was intentionally making it like that.   ", "I like that throughout the movie there seems to be this hazy line of who the main character is, because we don't really know who makes it through the ordeal. I theink the next time I see this movie I will be thinking about which character gets emphasis. At time it would seem that Major Warren is the main character, but it would give us these incredibly personal close-up shots of Joe Gage and Domergue. The camera would follow certain characters during certain times.\n\nWhat I came away thinking was that The Sherrif was the main character at the end, seeing as he came away being the most relatable and in general the most \"good\" person.\n\nThe other thing I found interesting was that the violence was both intense, and intensely funny, until they hanged Domergue. That one felt purely bitter, It was the only one that felt trully too much.\n\nThis whole movie was brilliant, Trantino I think will have this movie go down as one of the greatest of all time. In Django he had the imagery of the blood on the lillies and all that, but this movie is saying something really strong. I was awestruck with how challenged I was with viewing this movie.\n\n9/10 not 10 becuase there were imo a few too many throwaway shots that could have trimmed the movie down if taken out.", "I think this movie would have worked fantastically as a play. Tarantino does a play on Broadway, it would be like the biggest thing ever. \n\nI rank this above Kill Bill and Jackie Brown but below Pulp Fiction, Res. Dogs, and Ing. Basterds.\n\nStill, Samuel Jackson was just fantastic, as was Boyd Crow...er...I mean Walton Goggins.", "Score was fantastic. \n\nTitles were classic.\n\nCinematography was top notch, as always. \n\nThe gang was back.\n\nAnd I got to sit through another Tarantino masterpiece with a huge smile on my face. ", "The actual plot here is pretty great - very unpredictable and ruthless. But the execution is so-so, and I think its because most of the scenes lack the tension that make Tarantino's other films so incredible to watch. There isn't a mystery to solve because we aren't given any clues that make us think, and anything that would lead to that effect is immediately squashed; whether it be Quentin straight-up explaining that the coffee was poisoned, or Zoe Bell having this knowledge but not playing with the audience by toying with the other cabin members, or having a scene straight-up explain any plot holes near the end, it all feels like it lacks restraint. Quentin liked his plot so much that he couldn't find it in himself to give the audience more clues without just explaining it, or let them even think about anything before clearing it up.\n\nI think leaving the audience cold as to who were gang members without having a scene straight-up confirm that would have been SO much better, because Samuel L Jackson's character feels almost like an unreliable narrator, and to leave the audience guessing as to his motivations feels more interesting.  As for the tea scene, it reminded me of an old film where a meeting took place in a room and the audience knew there was a bomb under the table but the meeting is carried out completely normally, in a sort of moment of dramatic irony. I might be getting this confused with Hitchcock's quote on the two people at breakfast with a bomb under the table, but I brought it up to make a point - wouldn't it be so much better if the chapter explaining the tea had no narration and just played out the prior scene from the woman's perspective, a bit like in Pulp Fiction, so we see what she did? Or perhaps we don't see the poisoning, and the film gives a little lampshading on there being something 'off' about the tea until its too late. I'm not great at spitballing an excellent alternative but what we got came frustratingly close to being good, but lacked an extra twist in how it was told that would just put you on edge. It was cool to know something the characters didn't, but that didn't really mean anything in the end because basically everyone who drank the coffee died and there was nothing that could be done to stop it. In the hypothetical bomb scenario, the bomb could be ticking, and somebody might hear it - it doesn't mean they figure out that they're in danger, but its so much fucking more interesting if the one dude that notices the sound than just \"oh shit the office blew up and they're all dead, oh well!\" They had a chance at least.\n\nOr how Channing Tatum (That's probably spelt wrong) suddenly appears out of nowhere - its a great surprise, but him being there really doesn't make the situation more interesting if he's killed off immediately after. I actually liked how fucking brutally quickly he left the film after appearing, but it feels like dead air including him if his presence doesn't change much else. Anyone could've shot Samual l. Jackson in the balls and it would've played out similarly.\n\nAgain, I love the plot. For every twist it has though, in execution I think \"Yes that's a great idea but...\" and feel frustrated that Quentin didn't spend more time reworking the script into something shorter that played with the audience more. Mystery-movies can be fun! R-rated Clue with guns sounds like a fucking riot - The Hateful 8 was CLOSE to that, but it felt like it could've been a play, the film format was not really used to full effect here and its a bummer. Oh well, its Tarintino so there were lots of fucking incredible aspects to it, so it ain't that bad!", "Really liked the movie but my only criticism is where Warren is speaking in slow motion towards the end.  Really annoyed me for some reason.  ", "Warren's fellatio spiel, truth or complete fabrication to entice General into shooting?", "Saw it Friday digitally in a smaller theater for the 5:30 showing. House was full. Absolutely loved the movie and I look forward to watching it again. I'm bummed I wasn't able to see the 70mm version, but hopefully next time (if there is a next time) there will be one closer to me.", "Trying to decided if this is his 4th, 5th or 6th best film.", "Having grown up with exposure to a lot of Spaghetti Westerns and movies like Clue-I really felt like I had a good grasp of what Tarantino was paying tribute to. It's a sucessful pastiche with some really interesting characters and some definite Tarantino trademarks,  such as the gore and general over the topness to shake things up quite a bit in act 2.\n\nI see a lot of comments regarding pacing, but I personally felt that the characters, dialogue and overall scenario were so entertaining that it kind of sucked me in and made it pass by relatively quickly. I personally liked it better than Django and Inglorious Basterds overall, just thanks to Tarantino exploring a completely different format and touching on some new themes here. Making a 3 hour stage play that entertaining was one hell of an accomplishment.\n\nThe slow burn and heavy character development really helped me understand why they were called the Hateful Eight. While you start the movie rooting for what seem to be some obvious 'good guys,' in time you realize everyone has some deplorable flaw to hide. The movie did a great job of keeping the pot stirring and the audience on edge with suspense.\n\nSo if youre expecting an action flick, you'll be sorely disappointed. This is a more retro structured film, with acts and pacing reminiscent of a bygone era in film. As a result it might come off as very alienating to folks acquainted to more modern, quick fire pacing were used to seeing as of late. ", "I wasn't so sure about the movie when I walked out, but I kept thinking about it and it kept just getting better and better in my head.\n\nI really loved the first half, setting up the mood and the suspense.\nMorricone deserves the Oscar for the score, the music is perfect for the movie.\n\nI tought the second half went too fast regarding the deaths, I would have liked one by one deaths to keep up the suspense (ten little indians/clue style).  Also I think that the narration was out of place without the intermission (Saw it in digital).", "For your first point I think one of the biggest plot points was that documents could be effectively faked in the Wild West, it was simply a necessity to survive in some cases. The Brit hangman was sort of a middle ground between the sheriff who we didn't know was actually a sheriff or not, and SLJ who carried around a fake Lincoln letter. It was a matter of superficial formality where, like in Game of Thrones, a document is in reality just a piece of paper. Power is created by what the person projects and his/her charisma.", "i felt like film was a great successor to his previous film Django Unchained, which i found to be overrated. The script, suspense, subtle humour, intertwining plots/chapters, music score and soundtrack and most notably, head-turning violence were all classic Taratino elements that were really effectively conveyed to the audience. I felt that our interest was maintained throughout the entire film as the plot developed and the suspense grew and grew and grew as the tensions between the characters grew. As i said before, i felt the script was done very well. Dare i say it matches the caliber of Inglorious Basterds? I think a couple of more rewatches would allow me to make a proper judgment, but for the time being, i think it's on par with it. T=In summary, this 8th film by him was really great!! ", "The \"cock-sucking\" scene will go down into my personal Top 10 list of movie scenes ever.....Samuel L. Jacksons laughing was priceless.", "who poisoned the coffee?!?!?", "The dialogue wasn't particularly strong in Tarantino standards. It seemed like he limited himself by constraining the setting to a single cabin. A lot of the characters had major potential, but weren't fleshed out enough. Fun movie, but it's not a great one in my opinion.", "Loved the movie overall. I personally would have preferred a hint at Tatum's character being under the floorboards though. It could have created a lot of added suspense similar to the intro of Inglorious Bastards. I also feel the hanging scene went on a bit too long and came off as unnecessarily sadistic. But all in all this film was incredible. I won't be quick to try and place it among his previous work because they tend to swap spots upon multiple viewings. ", "Late to the party. Just saw the movie. \n\nAfter having watched every Tarintino film I would rank this one near the bottom. Had great dialogue and loved the cast but it seemed like a very safe movie from QT. He didn't do anything special this time, and it made for a rather forgettable film. Had a similar plot to Reservoir Dogs set in the same world as Django.", "eh. surprised to see so much love here. this is like a parody of a good tarentino movie.", "I can't believe gore is one of the chief complaints for some of you pussies. Why bother with a Tarantino flick in the first place?", "Wow, did not expect to see so much hate here.  I freaking loved this movie, no doubt in my mind that this is my favorite movie of 2015.  The dialogue is pure Tarantino, and every bit of it crackles and gives each character life.  \n\nI can see how some people might be turned off by the pacing, but I loved every bit of interaction between the characters because I found it so interesting.  Everyone has motives, and you have no idea what any of it is, and it was exhilarating to discover.  \n\nI put a \"Yes\" that I would recommend this to anyone, but I probably clicked too enthusiastically early for that.  This definitely is more for Tarantino fans.  \n\nAs an aside, in terms of Tarantino's recent movies, I'd put this ahead of Django and Inglorious Basterds, but it's definitely close between this and Inglorious.", "Reservoir Dogs did everything much better", "A lot has been made of the intentional homage to Carpenter's \"The Thing.\" There were some pretty obvious nods there. I especially liked hearing Kurt Russell's \"one of us is not who they say they are,\" which was almost a direct line from The Thing.  But another huge influence had to be Agatha Christie, particularly \"And Then There Were None,\" which was originally published as \"Ten Little Niggers.\" \n\nAs a side note, a lot of people think the film falls apart in the second half (myself included). It seemed to be the point at which Tarantino just gave up on the psychological thriller component that made The Thing such a timeless film in exchange for the over-the-top gore fest the film became once the Major killed the General.", "Kurt Russel was amazing. I loved that character. It was too bad that he died so soon", "Saw it last night, thought it was great. Superb dialogue, fun plot, great atmosphere and music. Looked incredible in super aspect ratio. Probably my favourite QT movie since Pulp Fiction.\n\nI have two significant problems, however. One is the length: it's too long. I enjoyed every second and it held my attention the entire time, but really he could have trimmed 20-30 minutes and made it *better*, especially the prolonged after-interval scene.\n\n\nMy second problem is that the movie takes place in a seemingly amoral universe, and this makes it very hard to root for any character, even after everything has been revealed. The characters have no redemptive qualities, and the movie lacks any element of redemption or forgiveness or rightousness. I would have enjoyed it so much more if QT had just allowed one or two of the characters to have been 'good'. Particularly:\n\nSam Jackson - the fact that he may have sexually tortured a man hurts the film. It probably isn't true, but it is never confirmed or denied, and the fact that it COULD be true, soils my opinion of the character.
