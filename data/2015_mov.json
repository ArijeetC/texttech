There are some cool visuals, but it is just so incredibly stupid. The original is a bit ridiculous too, but it had humor and self-awareness. Structurally it's a bit awkward, but there are a few decent stunts, if you're into that. The film is *maybe* worth a watch if you haven't seen the original *Point Break*, but you should probably just watch the original *Point Break* instead. **4/10**", "Okay in all honesty, I didn't HATE it with a passion. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, and didn't even come close. Not once was I like PLEASE BE OVER, but also, it wasn't the best movie I've seen either. What stood out most was the scenery, I really did enjoy that part, now I want to learn how to surf and snowboard ;)\n\nBut would I ever urge someone to rush right out and see it? Nah. If it was on Netflix streaming for free? Sure! Watch it one night in when you don't have much to do. \n\nThe acting isn't atrocious, but it's not Oscar worthy either. This movie isn't trying to break ground as most moving picture of the year, it was semi entertaining at the very least, and that's what I was hoping for. I've seen the original and GASP it didn't latch onto me as a classic. It was just okay, and this in my opinion is just okay as well. \n\nI am very happy, however, that Edgar Ramirez is popping up in more films. He had a brief role in Zero Dark Thirty but I loved him in it. Can't wait to see him in Joy (even though I heard that was eh).

All of the \"crimes\" that could have been stopped really weren't (except, I guess, for the bank on the mountain? and even then I'm pretty sure Brody got away with something).\n\nThe whole climax of the movie with the rock climbing thing is essentially pointless because Brody never commits another crime when doing one of the 8. And he kills himself at the end, so nothing really came of that either.\n\nReally, I felt like the main character didn't really have an impact on the plot - it would have carried out more or less the same with or without his involvement.", "Saw it, hated every dumb second of it.

Like they used the wing suits after pulling off a heist or a chase involving snowboards. Didn't expect them to do those stunts just to do them. There was a large chunk of their movie where there was almost no conflict. So while the things they did looked cool, it was just so weird to have them kinda be meaningless.

If it had been called something other than Point Break and wasn't an obvious reboot I don't think it would garner the hate that is has. Certainly not a super compelling movie, and it won't win any awards. But I wasn't pissed that I had seen it. I thought the visuals were cool and I kinda wish I could have been involved in production. I bet it was a hell of a lot of fun for the stunt people that did the shots seen in the movie. It was some fun escapism. The sports were cool and the actors actually somewhat compelling. To be fair though I love the outdoors and all so I guess that appealed to me. Idk. Recently it seems people just slam movies that aren't groundbreaking or obviously going to win an Oscar.

Some of the writing is a bit wonky too.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n- Luke Wilson as Roger Goodell.  What's the point?\n\nOverall, eh.  Watch the Frontline documentary on Netflix instead.", "Just saw this today. The theater was packed, though that may just be because I saw it in Pittsburgh. Here are some general thoughts:\n\nI thought it was good overall, though there were a few examples of unnecessary plot contrives and attempts and conflicts. For example, Mike O'Malley's douchebag pathologist in the beginning was pretty much unnecessary, since he added nothing really to the plot (except maybe to show how seriously people in Pittsburgh take football?), and was pretty much eliminated about a third of the way through the movie. \n\nAlso, anyone from Pittsburgh will find the movie's implication that the federal charges against Dr. Cyril Wecht (Omalu's boss in Pittsburgh played by Albert Brooks) were false charges made in retaliation for Wecht's role in revealing CTE to be completely ridiculous. In reality, [Wecht was federally charged around this time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Wecht#Federal_criminal_trial), but the charges were legit and completed unrelated to the NFL, since Wecht is known to be pretty shady (and had actually been charged with similar crimes years prior to this). The charges were only dropped because Wecht could afford hire-priced attorneys and the U.S. Attorney prosecuting him was somewhat incompetent. \n\nOther than those little flourishes, I thought the movie was overall pretty good.

The NFL summit was in 2007. he NFL did not publicly acknowledge the link between concussions sustained in football and CTE until December 2009. \n\n\nHis boss was already a very well known pathologist. He worked on the Warren commission with the JFK autopsy and the Jon Benet Ramsey cases. His legal troubles were not at all related to the NFL and occured before the release of the report.\n \nI understand changing the story to improve the timeline but some of it was for dramatic licsence.

He can't remember insignificant things, and he mentions that he \"doesn't have control of his brain all the time\". He's in his late 40s, so that type of brain damage is not normal.\n\nThis movie made me rethink my love of football. I'm still going to watch the games for now, but I think we need to reevaluate why we allow men to do this to their bodies for a chance at good money in the NFL.

I can't think of any other reason why so much screen time was devoted to sloppily developing that relationship, especially when it was unrelated to the main plot thematically. This was only one of many problems with screenwriting and pacing. \n\nWill Smith was great, but the rest of the cast was forgettable.

I came into the movie with my critic hat on but came out really surprised how much I enjoyed every minute of it. I think it's all about perspective which can describe the polarizing reviews.  If you're looking for a movie about an interesting life, it's a great flick framed around (or better yet inspired by) all brave women, as noted in the introduction. If you're looking for something profound about social commentary, perhaps look elsewhere.  This is a story of one woman's life and a character study on the complexity of the word \"family,\" which encompasses joy, pain, heartache, and love. I love character studies so maybe that's why I loved it. \n\n\nGenerally I agree with Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 assessments of movies but I\u2019m stumped by their consensus of Joy (and everyone online). Contrary to reviews, Joy, starring Jennifer Lawrence, was a well-crafted story, filled with solid musical and emotional beats (both feel-good and heartbreaking), expertly constructed by director David O. Russell. Even my little brother, who is only 7, was engrossed throughout the entire 2 hours.\n\n\n**TL/DR; Critics are wrong; Joy is not a clich\u00e9 rags to riches movie but an interesting take one woman\u2019s journey backwards and forwards through her life, complete with an emphasis on the complexity of joy, pain, and love within the meaning of \u201cfamily.\"**", "This was so mediocre.\n\nIt's like all David O.

Russell makes every scene slightly comedic because he doesn't know how to actually dramatize it.\n\nNone of the scenes were satisfying.  \n\nMany of the scenes it was like David O. Russell didn't know how to get out of them.  The police just come randomly and she's like, \"no, please, stop, don't.  No.\"\n\nThey were also predictable.  \n\nIt was also impossible to suspend disbelief.  Oh yeah, of course Jennifer Lawrence freezes \"dramatically\" until her friend picks her out of her trance.\n\nIt was just so non-believable.  It was so hard to watch the movie and think of it as anything but people acting a lot for 2 hours.  There were so many conversations that felt like line reads.\n\nIt was just so impossible to invest in any of it.  And to top it off, there was never any real drama.  There was never any point where you were invested in whether she succeeded or not.\n\nAnd the scene where she goes down to Texas at the end is undramatic as well.  Nothing in this movie works, and most of it boils down to the shitty script.\n\nBut the execution was also pretty damn shit.\n\nBradley Cooper was the highlight in a really bad film (not that he deserves accolades or anything).  Jennifer Lawrence doesn't deserve any nominations.", "I am a David O. Russell fan. And I'm not a fan of many things. (*American Hustle* is a misfire but the rest is pretty damn good.) I watched *Joy* last night and realized over my breakfast bowl this morning that the mop is a first feature, Joy herself is him, and this movie is an autobiography. \n\nAnd this hurts my heart, because there seems to be an age old habit among directors, when they are finally trusted by the system to tell their own story, how they want to tell it, to pay tribute to this wacky thing they chose to do, and the crazy adventures that brought them to this moment. \n\nAnd this usually signals their downfall. Because it suggests their head is now shoulders deep up their own ass. For example, once Wes Anderson made *Life Aquatic,* his movies fell thereafter into marzipan caricatures of the previous films (*Fantastic Mr. Fox* being the noted exception). \n\nis this the trajectory of the modern successful feature director? To make: \n\n(A) one or two scrappy microbudget festival darlings, then \n(B) an impressive dramedy with bold-faced names that still bears their charming stamp, then \n(C) a prestige picture period piece with Hanks or DiCaprio or Clooney or Pitt, where the stars of the show are the Production Design and the Cinematographer, then\n(D) one of these kiss-of-death Homage-to-Directing circlejerks, followed by\n(E), (F), (G) and (H) wheel spinning, now-I'm-a-brand, cynical, give-em-what-they-want garbage pile after garbage pile?\n\nBy the way I liked *Joy*, the editing and cinematography and his trademark weird-flat-yet-micro-obsessive acting style are all great.

One minute she's being told she can't have a second chance on QVC, the next she's back on TV.   \n\nIt also bugs me how deceptive the trailers for this were.

I was struggling with suspension of disbelief for this movie already but this threw me over the edge.\n\nIt's a shame because it genuinely does have some good parts in it, I feel like it yo-yo's really badly from one extreme to the other, not helped by the frantic pacing. Just as soon as it starts to show promise. BAM, it switches scenes and moods entirely. This leaves a lot of unanswered plot points and just confused me.\n\nThe acting holds this one together, as unlikeable as the characters are, I've got to give credit to the cast for making them that way, if this is what Russell wanted, then I thought they hit the mark (a strange mark nevertheless)", "Well, i for one liked this movie. Probably gonna be an unpopular opinion, but i love David O. Russel films as well.

My biggest complaint is the same thing I had with American Hustle, David O. Russel seems to really like having characters mentioned that haven't come on screen yet. So I really was totally confused on the people in Texas and California. But I guess that is more of my fault of not paying enough attention. Overall, really good movie, don't see why it's getting such mixed reviews, I came in expecting a 5 or a 6, but am settling on a 7.\n\nBradley Cooper was the best part of the film IMO", "It's finally happened: people are starting to realize how severely overrated David O. Russell is. (note: I had called O.Russell a hack previously, but as many people pointed out, perhaps that wasn't the right word as O.Russell has made a few good films, but I still think on a whole he's overrated)\n\nI think reddit picked up on this with American Hustle when the critics seemed afraid to hate it, but the general public fucking loathed that incoherent mess of a film and when it blanked at the Oscars that year, people seemed to finally wake up and say \"Hey, you know what, that wasn't actually a very good movie.\"\n\nWhich brings us to Joy. I know other commenters here have issued similar sentiments so here goes: someone needs to tell David O. Russell to shove it sometimes. 80 percent of this movie does not work, and the other 20 percent that does is incredible, but what the fuck happened?\n\n**What works**\n\n-Very little, but the good parts:\n\n* Jennifer Lawrence is a pretty good actress and I know we love to circlejerk over her because of The Hunger Games and her overexposure but she did a pretty decent job here.\n\n* Bradley Cooper killed it. Hell, the QVC scenes were the highlight of the movie, mainly because they were like the only coherent parts that made any sense (which I'll get to)\n\n* I enjoyed the climax with the guy in Dallas. It seemed to really cap off Joy's arc.\n\n\n\n**What sucks**\n\n* This movie had the worst fucking exposition I've ever seen. From Diane Ladd's beyond-the-grave narration (nearly detached my retinas from rolling them so hard when we find that out), to the fact that we jump from Joy as a little girl to when she's divorced in a second, and then GO BACK TO SEE HOW SHE GOT THERE WHEN IT'S LIKE JUST GO IN FUCKING ORDER YOU'RE NOT GODDAMN TARANTINO THIS DOESN'T NEED TO BE OUT OF ORDER MY GOD.\n* Very little in terms of narrative arc. Just a lot of Joy getting shit on by people and then one or two wins and then a \"everything is great at the end!\"\n* The worst movie family I've ever seen in a while. Everyone here needed a good punch to the face.\n\n* Lots of weird overacting (especially from Rosselini. The whole gun in the room thing is really fucking weird.)\n\n* How much O.Russell tries to apply his free-wheeling \"the plot doesn't matter\" until it does nonsense. Unlike American Hustle where it results in this absolute piece of shit that makes NO sense, O.Russell seemingly accidentally takes us to the most interesting part of the movie (which is the QVC stuff) using this. Unfortunately, it goes off the rails again. \n\nIt's kind of like driving from New York to LA, but instead of taking the highway, you decide to take all the backroads which takes forever and you get lost, but somehow accidentally, you end up on the interstate once or twice and that ends up being the best part of the ride. \n\nGiven the critical reaction to this, I think studio execs are going to wise up to O.Russell, especially when this blanks at the Oscars (except maybe for Lawrence and Cooper because they're liked by their peers). I also think this was a rare misstep for Megan Ellison and Annapurna and hopefully they learn from it. ", "While I liked this film more than the last two O'Russel films this was such a damn mess. There was some really good stuff in here, especially from Lawrence but the film was such a tonal nightmare it was all lost.

So much time was spent with the family but it felt like it went no where. \n\nI love J.Law but she slipped in and out of her accent. The fact that she was 10 years too young to play Joy was also really distracting. The actress who played her mom seemed like a better fit for the role. De Niro wasn't believable in age as her father, but more like her grandfather; especially since her grandmother was in it. \n\nBradley Cooper's scenes were the most refreshing.

This certainly wasn't a bad film but I just kept wondering why it was a story worth telling; it's not like she was this fascinatingly independent woman either - she had to rely on her family to keep bailing her out.\n\nAll the surreal stuff just didn't work and the film seemed constantly embarrassed about the fact it was about the Miracle Mop lady, considering the advertising didn't even mention it.\n\nIt was also blatantly obvious they only included clips of J-Law shooting a gun and the whole \"Do you pick up the gun?\" speech to make the trailer look more sexy/interesting.", "Reading everyones views I can understand why people arent liking it.

A real spark of life in the storytelling rush and (in particular) Jennifer Lawrence's performance. I was completely charmed and moved. I especially loved that I was seeing the story of a character type I hadn't seen that often.\n\nAnd then the story just sorta stopped. Sure, things still happened. Some good things. Some bad things. But it stops being a story. Joy's son just disappears. Her father, mother, ex-husband, half-sister, best friend and father's girlfriend calcify into two static camps: either obstacles to Joy, or steadfast guardians of Joy. No change, or growth involved for any of them. Or Joy. Oddly, no payoffs, really, in the storytelling. Joy rises from near-Cinderella to rich matriarch, but we never see the dynamic change between her and the family members who shit all over her when she was down. \n\nOddly edited as well. Lots of obvious over-dubbed ADR lines jammed in to help explicate dramatically vague scenes. A decent rough cut or first draft of a story. \n\nAll spark. No shape.

", "DOR finally getting the criticism he's deserves.

Russel and not actually explaining why *Joy* is bad... typical reddit. ", "What a stupid way to open a film, a fake soap opera, with better actin then some of the characters\n", "movie was ass. Wasted time and money. Not even JL can carry this film", "This movie is beyond bad. ", "Wow, what a fucking mess of a movie. Nothing about it worked. So let's start from the beginning: \n\n-\tA fake soap opera opening the movie? Did DOR think this was creative? Because it's not\u2026 it's just dumb. There was nothing in that opening scene that wasn't explained in the dozen other scenes of Joy's mom watching her soaps. To make it the first scene is ridiculously stupid. \n\n-\tThe narration was horrible. But when the fucking grandmother died, it went off the rails into utter laughable absurdity. It was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the movie. In fact, it made it even more contrived than it already way. \n\n-\tDOR, who can't write an interesting screenplay to save his life, rewrote the entire screenplay for this movie so he could be the only screenwriting credit (probably so he wouldn\u2019t have to share the Oscar he was so sure he would win.) So, not only is he an asshole, but this script finally shows he has zero talent in writing screenplays. It's full of plotholes and cop-outs. The supposed jokes got zero laughs, the dreams were ridiculous, the dramatic dialogue was incredibly cringe-inducing, and the speeches felt fake and forced. Lawrence's line about how amazing it is that it's a different time in America compared to China is maybe the single worst line in any movie since Attack of the Clones. One of the worst screenplays in recent memory for a supposed \"big boy\" movie. \n\n-\tDOR thinks he's Scorsese, we've known that for some time. But what he doesn't realize is that random close-ups, 8 second tracking shots, and putting your story out of order don't make you a great director. It makes you look like someone who thinks that you need all these cheap gimmicks in order to be a great director.  There is absolutely nothing of note here that you can point to in terms of directing.\n\n-\tAlso, just sticking in random songs from the 60s and 70s every 20 minutes isn't \"cool\". Stop thinking you're Marty. \n\n-\tThere was no tension or drama. Every time Joy failed, there was a success like 5 minutes after. It was so obvious she was gonna succeed, no matter what was going on. \n\n-\tHer badass confrontation that we've been leading up two for two hours is\u2026 calling a guy in Hong Kong (a call that should have been made before she paid the first dollar), and telling some random Texas stereotype about it. And this Texan just completely crumbles. What is this, a fucking cartoon? \n\n-\tWhy did we have fake snow? Why was there so much Christmas stuff? Nothing fit, it's like DOR just wanted to throw shit at the bathroom wall and see what sticks. \"Hey, Goodfellas played Christmas music, so it'll work here too!\" \n\n-\tI thought the movie was about Joy building her empire\u2026 yet they completely left that out. \n\n-\tBradley Cooper was far and away the best part of the movie. It's actually my favorite performance of his. His scenes were great.\n\n-\tThe central sin in every DOR film is that it doesn\u2019t matter what happens during the movie, you know that everything is going to be tied up with a nice little bow at the end. In the last 10 minutes everything always comes together. Not matter how unrealistic, no matter how it goes against everything the movie has been saying the entire time\u2026 it just works out. Because DOR knows that people like happy endings, so he sells his creativity (or lack thereof) every goddamn time and takes the easy way out. There is not a single ambiguity seen in the endings of any of his last four movies. \n\nSo finally, people are starting to realize that David O. Russell is a hack. And I love it. Joy should be completely shut out from the Oscars, and anyone who gives it a positive review should be seen as an un-objective DOR fan boy. Jennifer Lawrence (who I quite like) was fine; sufficient, I guess. She in no way deserves any nominations.

My thoughts (spoilers):\n\nThe good:\n\n- Of all the movies I've seen, I think this is the only one in which literally every single person that appears on the screen dies. Can anyone think of another movie that did this?\n\n- I know most will disagree, but I thought this was the best, most engaging plot of any Tarantino movie. While Django was just a simple story of revenge, the Hateful Eight combined Pulp Fiction\u2019s storytelling, Reservoir Dogs\u2019 tension and mystery, and Django's setting to create a complex, unpredictable plot. As soon as Warren was shot from the basement and it went into the flashbacks, I was on the edge of my seat for the rest of the film. The way both stories came together was incredible, in my opinion. \n\n- I found the cast of characters to be incredibly diverse and likable. While Kurt Russell and Samuel L. Jackson were great, I thought Walton Goggins really stole the show. \n\n- Visually speaking, I thought the cinematography was very well done and the claustrophobic setting really added to the atmosphere. \n\n- As usual with Tarantino films, the soundtrack was great.\n\nNow for the bad:\n\n- While the writing was good, I found it a bit lacking compared to other Tarantino films, most notably Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. I know they were vital to the story, but I just didn't find the stagecoach conversations to be very engaging. With that being said, by any other standard the writing was great.\n\n- I also found the first half to be just a little bit slow. \n\nOverall, the Hateful Eight is in my top 3 Tarantino films, right up there with Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds. It\u2019s probably my favorite film of the year as well, to be honest (although I still haven't seen the Revenant). \n\n9/10", "I fully expect people to pick upon the random narration, I thoroughly enjoyed the film but the second I heard the narration I knew that's what people would dislike.

I absolutely loved it.", "Random question: Do we know what's getting cut out of the theatrical version?\n\nI see mixed reviews and I happen to feel mixed as well, albeit more positive. I felt that there were lots of ideas for stories Tarantino had that he decided to combine together.\n\nI feel like we could've had an entire movie around the craziness and sadism of Jackson's character. At the same time I feel another movie could be staged around a criminal gang trying to get revenge and save someone. He just did a Western Bounty Hunter story, but I guess he had leftover ideas. \n\nWhat did work though, REALLY worked in my opinion. Jackson's monologue was great, a lot of the comedy worked, and various performances were well done.

Tarantino may be saying that there was no winner in the Civil War. Instead, we were all and still are fucked. All we can do is slowly die and laugh it off.", "It's probably become one of my favorite Tarantino Films. It's going to be looked back on one day as one of those films we've overlooked. For a number of reasons.\n\nI'll preface by saying that I'm a huge fan of The Thing, and it's hard not to see how The Thing didn't influence the over-all tone and outlook of the film.\n\nIt is a cold brooding calculation of murder at its most depraved. It's a film of half-truths mixed in with Loyalty and dignity, but each person's loyalty and dignity defends them from the criticisms of cruelty. \n\nAs Oswald said, \"Justice delivered without dispassion is always in danger of not being Justice.\" That is the film's look at itself. It relishes in cruelty. Everyone's out to right the wrongs in some twisted way. From how the Bandits view themselves, to how Hangman Ruth see's himself, even to how Marquis see's himself.\n\nThe atrocities of self-served justice is in danger of being depraved revenge. And every moment of this film breathes that in some way. With its complex range of characters who brought their own specific moral agenda's.\n\nThe most interesting aspect about this film is that it is set in Reconstruction. A time when the South rebuilt itself into what will a monster of its own. \n\nSimilar to Reservoir Dog's masochistic-sadistic/Father-son relationship between Mister White and Mister Orange, we have Ruth and Daisy Domergue's twisted relationship. There is that Sado-Masochism in their roles. Daisy Domergue incorporates both elements. She gives out pain more than she is dished. Despite her being shackled, the aid of her allies willing to die for her is another pawn in the end. With the exception of her brother. Ruth's role in this relationship, a sadist who believes in justice, is one who eventually flips the role. \n\nAn interesting development within respects to the films role on women and minorities: Ruth has Daisy chained up. He then slaps the cuffs on Marquis. The one who refuses to be chained is the Southern Gothic Pride of Mannix. The Sheriff. Ruth's controlling the show for the most part until his demise, in which Daisy is looking to be set free. But she has not anticipated Marquis, who knows that Minnie and gang are more than likely dead. And let us look at how Daisy speaks to Marquis, how \"Blacks\" treat their women, despite the fact that Ruth has been beating her this entire time. Despite her being in chains, she still has a higher status than Marquis. We see this throughout the film with her allies coming to aid her. For Marquis, his savior is reliant upon the character of his person and another's, Mannix.\n\nMannix is the symbol of reconstruction and Gothic pride. He's come to the end of his rope. The decimation of the south took a toll on him in some way, so he's sought a job as a sheriff. His dignity in character is exactly what Marquis needs in order to exact Justice. And it's no coincidence that he is from the South. Southern pride is more than its racial qualities. It is the pride, honor, and value in one's self and the integrity he/she manages. As such, this will come to Marqui's advantage that Mannix is the product of that culture which fought to keep him enslaved. \n\nOne of the theories I'm slowly thinking about is this idea of recurrence. That they were destined to go into that cabin and that they'll continue going to that cabin forever. It's a feeling that I get, more than anything. But seeing certain shots made me think about it, like they are trapped in that storm. \n\nFor me, it's a movie about Paranoia, the perversion of Justice, Reconstruction, and the self-delusions we carry about ourselves.", "That coffee scene and the buildup to it, Holy Shit was that intense.\n\nEDIT: While I was trying to find the damn song from that scene on the soundtrack, I FINALLY found it. \n\nHere's the link if you all want to listen to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9_yNuPIWEU", "Walton Goggins was awesome, first time seeing him in a movie and already love him.

", "seems a few people are confused by the whole financial crisis/housing bubble and how it related to the movie. so here's a brief summary. *Disclaimer, I'm not a finance guy, just really interested in this stuff*\n\n**How Mortgages are SUPPOSED to Work:**\n\n* You walk in to a bank and ask for a loan to buy a house. The Bank will give you the money IF you're well qualified meaning you have a job, you have savings, you have a down payment and you have good credit. They give you the money, you get a house and you pay the bank every month (principal + interest).\n\n**What the banks REALLY DID during 90's and early 2000's that led to the collapse of the markets**\n\n\n* They started approving people for mortgages who had no business applying for a loan. One banker used the term, \"these people didn't have a pot to piss in, but we got them a mortgage\"\n* They took several mortgages and \"bundled\" them in to groups and sold those bundles to large investment banks.\n* The investment banks called these bundles \"mortgage back securities or MBS\". and they sold these MBS's as bonds and stocks to anyone who wanted to invest in them.\n\n* At first, they only bundled the best mortgages. These MBS's were rated AAA (Triple A) by the credit agencies (S&P, Moody's and Fitch). Remember in the movie when Mark Baum (Steve Carell) asks the old lady why they were rating the MBS's triple A? The old lady was working for S&P.  To give you an idea of Bond ratings, a US Bond isn't AAA, it's actually AA. Canada is AAA, Greece (which went Bankrupt) is rated Junk (or close to Junk).  \n\n\n* Investors LOVED MBS's because they provided a very high rate of return. Traditionally the safest investment are US treasury bonds. But in 2006, US bonds were only paying around 1% interest. This meant if you bought a 10 year T-Note (10 year treasury bond) you would only make 1% every year in interest which is nothing. Investors love US bonds b/c they're safe, but at 1% they want something that provides a better rate of return. \n\n* That's when the big investment banks started offering MBS's. MBSs are great because (1) they're \"safe\" since housing prices always go up (yeah right!) (2) All the MBS's were rated triple A meaning the banks made sure everyone was qualified to get a mortgage (LOL!) and (3) MBS's had a MUCH higher interest rate, between 5%- 7%.  Investors LOVED this and started buying up MBS's anyway they could. \n\n**this is where it went bad**\n\n* The demand for MBS out-grew the supply, so the banks started to loosen the requirements to get approval for a mortgage to the point where you could get a NINJA loan. (no income no job or asset verification). This was alluded to in the movie when Mark Baum's staff were talking to the 2 brokers in Miami who were bragging about selling mortgages to immigrants. \n\n* EVERYONE in the chain of command was making a LOT of money during the growth period. The guy who hosted a weekly seminar on \"how to invest in real-estate\" got a referral fee. The women who helped you file \"paper work\" got a nice commission when the loan was approved. The small bank that approved the mortgage got a commission when they sold the mortgage to a bigger bank and so on. The credit agencies who were supposed to evaluate these  MBS's were (and continue to be) incentivized by the big banks to give out AAA ratings.   Everyone was making so much money that they had no reason to stop and ask or verify the information.\n\n* The big banks started taking on some really really crappy mortgages and the MBS's that were rated AAA were suddenly filled with bad mortgages that shouldn't have been rated so high. These were called SUB-PRIME mortgages. \n\n*  Normally there are preventive measures to ensure sub-prime borrowers and lenders don't over extend themselves. For example you always hear on the radio \"come buy a car, we approve everyone!\" that may be true, but sub-prime borrowers will have to pay a huge penalty in the form of a higher interest rates. However the Banks took advantage of unsuspecting borrowers by giving them teaser rates (Get 0% interest today!!! no job no asset verification, we approve everyone- Come buy your dream house and get 2 rental properties while you're at it, use the rental income to pay for your house!). I mean if the bank tells you, you've been approved for a $300k mortgage at just $1,200/mo with $0 down, who wouldn't take it?? Especially when it seems EVERYONE is doing it??? It's crazy, but it happened. People just didn't ask. They were just happy to get approved and it made perfect sense, \"use rental income to pay back the house.\". \n\n\n* To make matters worse, the Credit agencies were still rating the MBS's AAA even though they knew they were crap! and eventually people would default.\n\n**How it crashed**\n\n* The economy started to go south in 2006 and suddenly people started to default on their mortgages. at first it was slow, but within months, default rates started to grow exponentially. In addition when the \"teaser rates\" expired, people's monthly payment jumped by as much as 200% (also eluded to in the movie). So even if some people managed to keep their jobs, it wasn't enough to meet the new monthly payment requirements. Imagine you pay $1,200/month and all of a sudden you're told you now have to pa $2,500/month.\n\n* Because people weren't paying their mortgages, the banks weren't making money and investors weren't getting their monthly checks. Demand for MBS's dropped and the Big Banks were stuck carrying a bunch of crappy Mortgages that were completely worthless!.  \n\n* Before word got out to the general public, The banks began liquidating their MBS's as quickly as possible to smaller banks, small investment firms and eventually to the general public.  It's as if a used car dealer discovered all the breaks on their cars were faulty and rather than doing the right thing and alerting the authorities or at least letting their customers know, they just put all the cars on sale for 50% off and hope people would buy them. Only in this case, even when customers asked if anything was wrong, they flat out lied and said the car was in perfect working condition. Add to this, they told the credit agencies \"please don't tell on us, until we get rid of these MBS's and of-course they obliged. \n\n* By the time the news broke in the summer of 2007 of the magnitude of the collapse, the big banks had managed to unload a fair amount of their MBS's and they were able to absorb the losses (thanks to the bailout). The smaller banks failed and investors lost everything. \n\n**How these guys in the movie made money**\n\n* These guys realized that the quality of MBS's weren't as good as the investments banks were claiming. At the beginning of the movie, Michael Burry (Batman) asks \"how is it that dot com crash didn't affect housing prices in the areas that were so dependent on the industry?\". He started to look at these mortgages and noticed a lot of people were defaulting. The other guys in the movie basically did the same thing.\n\n* So all of them basically bet AGAINST the MBS.  When you BET against a stock, it's called \"shorting\" which means you think the stock price will go down instead of up. These guys went to the big banks and basically said \"we'll pay you a monthly fee and we'll bet against these MBS's. In 2  years if WE'RE right YOU have to pay US. If WE'RE wrong, you just made a TON of money from our premiums plus all the money we'll owe you\".\n\n* In the end, these guys were right. MBS's crashed and they all got a huge pay-out.  The suspense in the movie was them knowing WHEN to sell. If they sold too early and MBS's dropped, they would miss out on higher profits. If they sold too late, the would risk letting the banks go under and as a result, not get anything. \n\nHope that helps clarify things.

It mostly deviated from the book on the less important emotional, character building stuff, and (from my memory) stayed mostly true on the important bits.\n\nIt was quite fun, and worth a watch. There were two things that bothered me, and held me back from being totally positive about it.\n\nFirst, I thought the editing/montages were a little off. Not the worst, but they didn't *quite* work for me. The celebrity explanations of financial concepts were hit or miss. I dislike when movies act like \"Yeah, we know this is boring, but bear with us as we try and breeze through this\". These financial terms are the absolute core of the movie! We don't need or want them to be dumbed down for them! For instance, Gomez was charming, but the explanation of the synthetic CDOs wasn't very good. (I'll note my issue with it at the bottom). The rest of the montages felt a bit too disjointed and random to really click.\n\nSecond, I wish they explored a bit more how these people, by and large, were *not* crusaders. Baum, who was based on Steve Eisman, seems to have been a bit realistic, in that he really did have a dislike of the bullshit of the financial system. But the movie had one important scene where the lady from S&P called Baum out on his self interest (where he accused them of grading based on the interest of the banks, while he in fact only *really* wanted her to downgrade the ratings based on his incredibly risky bet!) This slight hypcrisy is important, and could have been explored more. Some of these guys were still insiders of the financial system. They focused so much on how pissed of Eisman/Baum was, I wish they had looked at the others a bit more. Look at the rest of Eisman's team, and Jamie Shipley, and how they were in fact betting on, and rooting for, the American economy to collapse. This is not to criticize their actions, they did nothing wrong, I don't fault them at all. But you have to examine what it means for someone ingrained in the financial system to bet on the American economy collapsing. Laud their genius, but you don't need to portray them as saints. I know they covered this *briefly*, but I wasn't impressed by it. It basically boiled down to Brad Pitt's harsh judgment of the two young guys, and the scene felt awkward, largely because I thought Brad Pitt's character just didn't feel very grounded. I wish more focus had been placed on Burry, who is a fascinating character. The problem is that they recognize that Burry didn't really give a fuck about the immoral nature of the system, he was just frustrated that they were incorrect, and angry that other people couldn't see what he saw. Thus, focusing more on him would have detracted from the moral angle of the film. But I thought it would have made the movie a lot more interesting than Baum's \"crusade\". \n\nDespite what the movie implies, *many* people were discussing the possibly property bubble. Many thought it was unsustainable. The crucial point is that the movie focuses on people like Burry who made unbelievably bold bets that the entire system would crumble, and *soon*. They should have been a bit more accurate about that. People would not have mocked people for claiming that the CDOs had a lot of shitty loans in them. There was a spirited debate about this at the time. The question was whether if the worst tranches failed, that would cause the better tranches to fail as well. This was the crux of the bet that the protagonists made. Too often this movie acted like no one on wallstreet was willing to even question whether this was sustainable. More accurate would be to say that people didn't understand how completely the system would crumble once the property bubble burst.\n\n**In all, very fun movie, but I thought it came up a little short in terms of its moral focus. Felt like it tried a little too hard to just nail the anti-finance buzzwords that ar epopular, and didn't want to delve into the interesting details of the story. Worth a watch for the cast, but don't worry too much if you can't make it**.\n\nTo clarify my issue with the Gomez scene, they just constructed her example so poorly! They say Gomez could win, or could lose, this hand. She has a bet on that outcome. Spectator 1 places a bet with spectator 2 that Gomez will win, on 3-1 odds. The event that spectator 1 wins the bet is *the exact same* as the event that Gomez wins. Thus, the idea that spectator 3 would bet on the *exact* same event, but at 20-1 odds, had to have been pretty confusing for the audience. Because, unless someone is a total idiot, that would never happen! That sort of idiocy was not the core of these synethetic CDOs. The idea was that you make bets that play on the risk. Imagine 100 Selena Gomez's. You  can not place bets on how many of those 100 wins, and that sort of thing. Thus, you're still betting on the outcome of the games, but it isn't literally the same event. Thus, it makes sense for there to be series of bets placed on series of bets and so on and so forth. That's the actual basis for those, the example they used was deeply misleading.", "Really enjoyable movie. Great performances all around. I'm 18 I don't know anything about CDO's and stuff but those little fourth wall breaks actually helped me keep up with all the technical talk. Not perfect some scenes feel like they're pretty unneeded but not distractingly bad. I honestly feel like Christian Bale was somewhat underused. Granted what more could they have done with him in his setting. Overall really good movie.

Fascinating story and really great acting.", "As someone who had family members working for Lehman in 2008 (although not involved with mortgages), I found this movie absolutely terrifying. A few scenes literally made my jaw drop:\n\n-The Jenga scene, where they reveal that the mortgage backed securities that nobody wanted to buy were simply repackaged as \"AAA\" CDOs. Totally blew my mind.\n\n-The scene where they reveal that $50 million in mortgages could balloon into almost $1 billion in value.\n\n-When S&P admitted they were falsely giving CDOs a certain percentage of AAA ratings because if they didn't they would take their money to Mooney's or some other rating firm.\n\nAll absolutely terrifying.\n\nAlso, I thought an interesting undercurrent of the film was the role pop-culture plays in our society. Early in the film, Baum (Steve Carrell's character) talks about how people are so consumed with sports and who celebrities are dating they are blind to everything else. I heard an interesting interview with Adam McKay on NPR about the scenes where he gets celebrities to explain complicated financial transactions. I'm paraphrasing, but he talked about how he wanted to show the juxtaposition of celebrities using their clout and airtime to not just spew \"bullshit\" but to contribute to the public consciousness and discourse. I thought it was a well done theme that ran throughout the movie without taking away from the main storyline.\n\nOne of the better movies I've seen this year, and by far one of the scariest.

And then he says something like \"this didn't happen\". Instead US tax payer's money was used by corrupt politicians to bailout too big to fail banks which should have been broken up ages ago, and their equally corrupt executives also paid themselves bonuses with tax payer's money. It's unbelievable to me that a revolution hasn't already begun! But I guess this is due to people just thinking of it as a movie, even though everything is fucking real, just like in the days of the Roman Empire where they would do huge circuses and colosseum battles along with handing out bread, so the population would be happy and not give a shit.

I love when actors do roles against type (Carrell in Foxcatcher), so to see Adam McKay direct a movie so completely different than what he's done before was just very refreshing - and I say that considering him to be the director of my favorite comedy ever (Anchorman).\n\nI like how well he blended the comedy with the utter depressing events. It was as if to say, \"This is so sad, we have to find a way to laugh at this.\" The vision that he took with it and the little nuances (someone pointed out Lauren Conrad and Barry Bonds as examples of frauds) were just great.

It kept a reasonably excited pace for a topic that would otherwise be extremely drab.  I never would have thought that a movie entirely about the housing market and economy could hold my attention for over two hours.  There were several jump cuts that just worked somehow.  I spotted one continuity error with Margot Robbie but now at the end of the film I\u2019m unsure if it was intentional or not.\n\nI really enjoyed this film.

Christian Bale was great, but I was surprised by how little screen time he had overall. The real stand out performance however, was Steve Carrell. I am glad to see he is getting some nominations. The scene in which he finally opens up to his wife about his brother was extremely emotional, and that was simply because Carrell had made his character one we feel sympathy for.

Moral hazard? Immoral certainty is more like it.\n\nThey view Congress as a bunch of chumps, and they H.A.T.E. Elizabeth Warren.

So they can own a plain vanilla bank, a company set up to sell insurance, a company set up to sell swaps that bet the US healthcare system will get more expensive, a company that holds synthetic swaps etc. x 10^zillion.\n\nBank holding companies, the ultimate top dog owner, can have thousands of these swap entities. They don't even know how many. They don't even know the counter-parties. They don't know if the counter-parties could pay off if they lose, or if they're insured (AIG- ishly). Selina Gomez times a zillion. \n\nSo, if you drew an org chart, there would be one circle at the top (the holding company) and a bunch of circles with lines going in every direction connecting maybe thousands of affiliate entities. \n\nThe banking elite  fully believe the public taxpayer should bail them out for gambling with OPM. They fully believe that pushing off the dog shit CDOs onto Fannie/Freddie/taxpayers is fully justified.

(Tru dat.) The story is teed up with sympathetic protagonists vs. slimey arrogant Goldman types. \n\nChristian Bale was totally believable as the on-the-spectrum glass-eyed Silicon Valley investor who actually read the underlying mortgage documents. \n\nThe Brad Pitt character struck me as Billy Beene-gone-unibomberish.  But, is it paranoia if he's correct? After all, NSA is listening in. \n\nSteve Carrel's portrayal of a tragi-comic Wall Street fund manager was a counter-point to Ryan Gosling's white collar psychopathic trader.   The therapy sessions/brother subplot could have been left out, I think, although it did bring in Marissa Tomay as the concerned wife.  \n\nThe Asian actor who played the sleezy CDO seller (in Vegas) was just unctuous enough to make us feel slimed. Not over the top at all. \n\nOk: the film could have been a dry trudge, but has the  feel of an episode of The Office, sort of. \"Flash Boys\" could be similarly done, I think.\n\nThe audience is immersed in the world of mortgage backed securities.

In fact, the whole cast, hell, the whole movie was well done! \n\nThat being said... It's not a theater movie to me. \n\nLet me explain: a movie like Captain America or Star Wars where there are big action sequences that can take advantage of a big screen and big sound are \"theater\" movies in my mind. A movie like The Big Short I can just as easily rent and watch comfortably at home.", "Bloody brilliant movie. First thoughts after I walked out of the theatre was the timing of the release! With the Bernie Sanders political campaign gaining momentum and his stance against Hillary and Wall Street, I won't be surprised if Bernie campaign gets a shot in the arm. \n\nComing back to the film- Loved how Ryan Gosling false-narrates the aftermath of the market crash, then BAMM! made the audience realize the inefficiency of the government and that the majority blamed the same things (immigrants etc.) Baum predicted we would. By saying it twice, the impact was more profound and made me go Holy shit! Another exceptionally well shot sequence was Baum calling out the fraudulent system on the stage on the day of the collapse. The pop-culture montages were a killer. The film had many small vital moments throughout - like the scene on the terrace of a Las Vegas hotel when the lady revealed she didn't face any problem floating her resume to big banks after quitting her job from the SEC, an organization that regulated banks.. Bale was outstanding and Pitt was at his subdued best. \nThis film needs to be watched by all! 9/10. ", "Enjoyed the movie, but you can clearly see the agenda to pin it all on wall street.  It didn't speak of the governments role much, freddy mae & mac, the fed.  It briefly touched on the ineptitude of the SEC, but just in passing.  Nor did it talk about other voices in congress and the private sector that were warning of the collapse.\n\nWallstreet built and sold something dumb, borrowers were dumb, rating agencies were dumb and government incentivized the activities to boast home ownership metrics.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that they talked about jailing bankers, however they didn't say for what.  They didn't show any bribing or anything like that.  They showed massive ineptitude to understand the financial vehicles they built.  Everyone was riding the gravy train as with any bubble.", "Just saw this movie and I really enjoyed it.  I wish there was more of a payoff of the end because I wanted to know more about the reactions from Burry's people after they made so much money.  I did some Googling and felt bad because Burry said in an interview that there was no conversation and it was silent.  \n\nJoel Greenblatt (the guy who flew out to Burry and demanded his money back) ended up making so much money. I'm wondering if he apologized afterward or was humble, or if he was angry despite his huge profit.\n\nI know the movie said Baum never said \"I told you so\" to people, but I would have been intrested to see how people treated him afterwards.  But I think that's mostly because I'm the kind of person who would have said \"I told you so\" after that much doubt and harassment and stress and people thinking I've lost my mind.\n\nI really enjoyed the movie overall.", "I just started the book this weekend.  How come Steve Eisman isnt the movie?  So far, he seems like a big part of it and a very interesting person.", "This may have already been answered but here goes:\n\nOn the final credits when the story was being concluded in short text snippets, what was the relevance of saying the only stocks he plays with now is Water?

", "I just have to post this out there, even though this thread is considered \"old\" for Reddit standards. \n\nI did an internship at a major investment bank last summer and many of my friends went to the bulge brackets of NYC. And I think that the movie wasn't as good as it could be AS A MOVIE (camera work, performances, dialogue, etc.). It probably was the best movie I have ever watched that properly pictures the personalities and dynamic of Wall Street, how professionals interact (to certain extent), and the overall \"vibe\" of working in Wall Street. \n\nI can see how the average non-finance person may not like the movie, but as someone who once wanted to be part of that world, I can say that this movie properly puts in perspective how that environment really is.", "Absolutely loved it.

Fantastic performances, great humor, they did a good job making it actually somewhat understandable to a layperson (because it was quite complicated, what happened). However, the editing hampered my enjoyment of the film. So many needless short cuts and vocal fade outs/layering and I'm still trying to figure out the thematic relevance of all that imagery they flash/cut to during some parts of the movie. \n\nI might need to see it again. It's definitely good, I'm just not sure HOW good. I did enjoy it though, that much is certain.", "I loved the story and felt that it was kept simple enough for everyone to understand it but not dumbed down. I think most of the actors did an amazing job. \n\nTypically, in wall street movies you see a bunch of slick 'untouchable' people but I felt this movie really showed a more realistic side of wall street. Most of the people on wall street are probably extremely smart; from top notch institutions and probably have tons of quirks. I appreciated that about this film. \n\nThat being said, I thought Brad Pitt's acting was awful in this film. He was pretty bland and I felt like he was just saying his lines like he was at a table reading. \n\nAlso I could see how some people might like it, but I wasn't a fan of the sound mixing or scene editing this movie had. \n\nAll in all I would give it a 7/10; just my personal opinion.

The Bank then says that to make sure that he will get his money that he will have to pay monthly payments and if the bonds go up then he will have to pay them money (Approx 20min into movie)\n\nWhy is Michael Burry willing to pay the bank the premiums when the failure of the bonds could lead to the Bank going bankrupt and not paying him the money?

I thought that the righteous anger of Steve Carrel and Brad Pitt were exactly what this movie needed. The humor was really great.

I rolled my eyes hard at that scene. The other one where the SEC sister and the Banker are literally in bed together also was bad. Subtle this movie is not.\n\nI don't think that breaking the fourth wall was all that necessary and often condescending and had a muddled message that didn't fit with the rest of the film. When they broke the forth wall they seemed to be saying: You people only care about this when celebs say it. Where as the rest of the film is about the predatory nature and exploitation of the system by the banks. Though those do come from the narrator who may or may not be a sociopath. So maybe that's his opinion on the matters at hand.\n\nSo it's funny and angry but also heavy-handed and muddled.", "Just came back from seeing this movie and all i can say is \"Wow\" Aside from Sicario nothing else this year has made such a great impact on me. I really think this is one of the most emotional movies of the year since it really does follow the narrative and essence of the banking system in the 2000's. I'm sure most people on reddit can't understand the 2008 crash since they are to young to grasp it, but the movie really does strike a hard chord with me since i was becoming an adult in the time period.

This movie wasted tremendous performances (Carrel and Bale in particular) so that McKay could indulge every impulse to jump-cut, patronize, over-stylize and pound away with heavy-handed metaphors. \n\nThis movie also suffers from natural comparisons to Margin Call, which handled the same topic with clarity and restraint. I would have loved to see this setup with a more disciplined director. I'm dumbfounded that McKay received an Oscar nod for this film - Todd Haynes, F.

There should be as many movies about this as about holocaust", "An entire movie about the financial crisis, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac not even *mentioned* throughout the film. \n\nI'm sorry, but it was agenda-driven.

I know the movie's supposed to emit the fast-paced style of wall street and such, but it felt a bit over-the-top in a couple scenes like the phone call Steve Carell makes to his wife on the street. \n\n* I felt like Christian Bale was miscast. Probably not gonna be a lot of people who agree since Bale's such a big name, but he seemed a bit out of place and almost 'too cool' to be playing the part and it seemed like a bit of Patrick Bateman creepiness dripped into this performance a bit. They tried making him erratic and everything, and he acted well, but it felt like someone else could have pulled off the hectic character without seeming kinda creepy. [Real Michael Burry](https://imgur.com/OzHcs2H) doesn't seem quite so crazy looking. \n\n* The ending felt a bit rushed.  I spent the movie in anticipation of the payout at the end, and it didn't seem to go as in-depth as I would've liked.  What did Burry's investors say? Why was everyone so frantic to rush and did Baum miss out on significant cash by not selling earlier, when the other characters did?\n\nWhat I liked\n\n* Steve Carell killed it.   The rest of the actors were alright, but nobody stood out (except Vinny in my opinion), but he was very convinving in his role.\n\n* 4th wall breaks were helpful and felt necessary. Camera cut to Anthony Bourdain was great, same with the Selena Gomez one.  The Margot Robbie one was kind of forced but still fine.  \n\n* The douche mortgage brokers in Florida (and their depressed look) at the end were great.  \"They're not confessing, they're bragging\" was the best quote of the movie for me.\n\n\nI feel like I didn't like it as much as everybody else, but that may have been me expecting more of a Moneyball / Wolf of WS type movie, when this one seemed much more fast-paced and information based than those two. Effective at getting me to understand the topic, but not quite as entertaining. ", "I loved this film so much. I saw it twice and recorded my thoughts both times. I'll probably write something longer later, but for now:\n\n12/23: Explaining how the 2008 financial crisis started is already hard, but making that explanation entertaining is basically a miracle. In the case of *The Big Short*, which opened nationwide on December 23rd, it appears as if Christmas came early. Not only does the film do a fantastic job at detailing something so complex, but the movie is funnier than a lot of mainstream comedies. Directed by Apatow-style director Adam McKay, the ensemble cast pulls out great performances, mixing character with comedy. While some of the transitions are dubious, the structure is very interesting. Mixing documentary and narrative, *The Big Short* creates a thesis-driven film that adds a lingering impact to itself.\n\n12/24: What becomes apparent on a second viewing of *The Big Short* is how well structured and edited the film is. Dealing with the complex financial industry, this is an incredibly dense movie. However, instead of becoming a necessary slog, the humor, pacing, and performances make the film an enjoyable repeat viewing. The brilliance of the fourth-wall breaks also becomes apparent. By acknowledging the audience, the movie shifts the dynamic and reclaims power from the audience. Instead of acting as a voyeur, the audience has a tour guide that explains significance as well as enhances the documentary feel. Transitions made more sense on a second viewing, and there are a lot of layers to appreciate. This film is a work of genius. \n\nEDIT: My [full review!](http://sternreviews.com/written/the-big-short-review/)", "Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but it has been, by far, the worst directed major release I've ever seen.\n\nThe problems started right away with the weird cutting between 2005 Burry in his office, in the pool, and Young Burry playing in a football game. That cutting was weird, but it was totally fine compared to the weird zooming and focus issues the camera had in Burry's office.\n\nMultiple times throughout the film the dialogue did not line up with the way the actors' mouths were moving. This was clearly done intentionally (this is, apparently, not just a lazy redubbing), but to what purpose? The scene where Baum finally talks about his brother is a particularly outrageous example of this. All I could think about the entire scene was, \"Why is this scene blocked/edited/dubbed like this.\" I felt no empathy for Baum or his wife at all.\n\nBasically, every time I noticed a deviation from \"stationary camera with a flat angle\" I felt like it detracted from the movie. Does anyone else feel the same way?", "A fantastic, funny movie that actually made sense of a confusing event.", "There is a transition scene about midway through this movie. It's just a quick shot of a random underpass in what I assume is Lad Vegas. Above that underpass is a billboard with Martin Short's giant face on it....\"Big Short\"..Coincidence or ridiculously awesome easter egg?", "Really great and well-balanced. Loved the Margot Robbie and Anthony Bourdain device and how the film hammered home our obliviousness to the crisis with all the random pop culture montages.\n\nIt's tricky to make something piss you off and thoroughly entertain you but it managed both. Props to Adam McKay, a big step up for him.", "I'm really glad I knew nothing about this movie going in. The whole style really caught me off guard and I thought it was executed perfectly. Steve Carell and his entourage especially killed it.\n\nMy only real complaint is that as someone who really doesn't understand Wall Street I could have used a bit more explaining what happened to them all at the end in terms of how much they really profited, but that may just be me.\n\nAlso I feel like Bernie sanders could have stuck an \"I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message at the end\" (not that that's a bad thing).\n\nIn my opinion, the most important movie of the year.", "What will be the next Big Short.....water possibly?  What else?", "One thing I don't get from the \"Summary\" line given in the introduction to this post. The line reads:\n\n> *After four financial experts fail to convince the banks and the government that the 2007 housing bubble was about to burst*, the players decide to do the unthinkable and bet against the US economy.\n\nI guess the 4 experts are the main characters (played by Bale, Carell, Gosling and the Colorado guys). I just don't remember the part in which they go altruistic and try to convince the banks and government of the then upcoming catastrophe instead of immediately betting against the market to get huge profits...\n\nI watched the movie yesterday and got to the theater 5 min. late, so I may have missed this...", "I really liked it, definitely in my top 3 of the year.

The cameos were great and the characters were all pretty fun and likable when they were supposed to be. My only gripe, and it's a major one, is I had no fucking idea what was going on the entire time. I understand it's a complex subject and it's hard to explain everything but even what they did explain didn't make much sense. The only thing I really got was the fish stew metaphor and that only seemed like a fraction of the big picture. I feel like a good movie should do a good job at making the dumbest movie goer understand the material, especially when it's that intricate. The Martian did a fabulous job at explaining the science of what was happening and why people were doing what, but this movie just didn't. Overall, it just didn't seem like it had much of a plot because of all of that. Also, the ending didn't really make sense.

I like that the storm troopers were actually competent. They're an elite fighting force and it felt like they could actually do things this time.

Finn was trained in combat so even though that was his first time using a lightsaber he was still a competent fighter. However despite that, once the storm trooper saw the lightsaber he didn't even care, he was ready to fight what to his knowledge was a Jedi, and he was confident.

It was obviously not designed as a one-time-only weapon, considering it's ability to reload via sucking up a star like it was Kirby.

I think she was taught by Luke and he somehow wiped her mind of her memories and put her on Jakku so she would not turn out like Kylo Ren (or maybe it was to protect her from Kylo). The force is literally awakening within her. Even Kylo says this when she escapes and he says she is experimenting with her powers. I think Luke's expression in the final scene is not one of uncertainty, but one of surprise that she came back to him. Just my two cents.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2: As /u/HalvJapanskFyr poined out, the visions she has upon touching the lightsaber in Maz's palace are not premonitions, but look more like memories. The force was clearly trying to tell her something (i.e. she was originally a padawan) through these visions just like the force showed Luke his own face in Vader's mask, foreshadowing Luke's  realization that Vader is his father. Both the cave and the basement in Maz's palace are these force-sensitive areas, so if we are drawing parallels between the OT and TFA and Luke and Rey, this seems to be a glaringly obvious one.

This move is actually pretty good like the reviews are saying. \n\nI groaned at a one liner here and there, I rolled my eyes a a plot convenience or two, and I saw JJ's influence all over the writing which isn't a bad thing necessarily. But through all that I still felt like I was watching a legitimate sequel to something I have so much nostalgia for. This movie *felt like Star Wars.* I left the theater happier than I expected to be and excited that there are two more in the trilogy to come. What more could I have asked for?\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of likes and dislikes. I liked:\n\n- All the new characters. And that this was their movie. We didn't even see the Falcon or Han until 20 or 30 minutes in. The old cast were mostly minor characters and the new characters were interesting and likeable enough that I was glad the movie focused on them. Ridley and Boyega did such a great job with this movie on their shoulders and I'm so excited to see more Poe Dameron in the coming movies. And yeah, BB-8 was super cute and funny.\n\n- Kylo Ren was unstable, childish, and prone to temper tantrums. Made for a solid villain who still has a journey ahead of him as much as Rey and Finn do. It was even cool to see him push himself too far at the end and be defeated by a n00b because a smarter Sith would have cut their losses after being injured twice. But Ren was cocky... Like his father.\n\n- The movie felt human. Obviously a big complaint with the prequels was bad writing and robotic blocking and overall it just not feeling human. TFA had that impact in some scenes where you really felt for the people on screen. I mean, not all of it hit home perfectly, but the Han and Leia scene where she says to bring their son home was 30 years in the making and the movie successfully got to me in a few scenes.\n\n- It was funny. There were some one liners I didn't love but some of the exchanges were really funny.The range of emotion, from comedy to excitement to dramatic, was really impressive. Not something easily done and considering how much pressure this movie had to be to make I'm really just impress it's half as good as it is.\n\nAs far as things I didn't like:\n\n- I could see Abrams writing too much a few times. You know, how like in Star Trek they have these hilariously quippy conversations in the midst of real danger and you're like okay that's fun but there's danger. A lot of critics applaud the scene where Finn keeps grabbing Rey's hand when they first meet to get her away from danger and while I like the scene for the same reasons, turning the damsel in distress thing on it's head and also showing Finn likes Rey, I felt like if she said it once it would have been enough. She mentioned it like three times and eventually I was like k your home planet is blowing up least of your problems.\n\n- People are saying it's too much like ANH, but I don't really see that as a solid criticism because it makes sense that they would mirror and it was done well enough that it didn't bother me. However, the scene where they were planning their attack on the Star Killer (totally NOT the Death Star) I was like I swear I've seen this exact scene before. Twice. So that scene was a little too the same.\n\n- As mentioned, some of the one liners and fan service jokes got a groan out of me. \n\n- Not enough Oscar Isaac. But I just love that guy and want to party with him so I'm glad there are more movies to come and more screen time for all the characters we want more of (Phasma, Luke, etc.)\n\nOne thing I know people are upset about was Rey's ability to learn the force quite quickly but honestly that didn't really bother me. As soon as she successfully mind controlled that probably-Daniel-Craig-trooper I knew she was probably Luke's daughter. Plus she did it on her third try in a now or never moment. And she didn't really use the Force again until she got the lightsaber, which we were shown had a connection with her, and she got lucky by fighting an overly emotional and twice injured Sith who is still in training. It just didn't seem like such a big stretch it ruined the movie I guess.\n\nOverall I really do believe that there is no such thing as a perfect Star Wars movie anymore. The franchise is too big, the old movies too iconic, the fans too rabid, the profit too big, there's just not way to please everyone. That said, I really think this is as good a first sequel we could have gotten considering all that and I'm really excited to see it again. And extremely excited for sequels. ", "I've already seen downvotes attacking dissenters like a swarm of hungry piranhas, so I'm going to preface all this by saying that I *liked* this movie.  I'm going to see it again, and I'm sure I'll like it the second time too.  I've been telling my friends to see it because I'm confident that they'll have a good time.   It's a good movie.\n\nIt is, however, deeply flawed.\n\nIt's not just that the movie is largely a re-hash, it's that it's a very obviously rushed re-hash that leaves an astonishing number of significant plot elements painfully undercooked.  First and foremost, the movie fails to establish the *stakes* in the universe that it presents.  It seems to think that it's sufficient to simply regurgitate elements of the originals and hope to skate by on the warm light of homage and nostalgia, without bothering to explain why any of it should matter. \n\nWhat *happened* during these last 30 years?  Who are these First Order people?  Are they a significant threat?  The Republic - is it fragile?  Is it strong?  Should I root for it?  How in the world does the \"Resistance\" figure into any of this?\n\nWho in the world *are* these guys?\n\nIf anything, this throws into relief the remarkable economy of storytelling that powered *A New Hope*.  The opening scene of a massive Star Destroyer hunting down a fleeing vessel tells you - without using a single word - everything you need to know about the overpowering menace of the Empire and the scrappy, underdog Rebellion.  \n\nIn TFA, you've got a Star Destroyer buried in the sand  ...for some reason.  Okay, looks like the Empire got its teeth kicked in.  Oh wait, the First Order also has plenty of Star Destroyers to spare.  So are they strong?  Weak?  Relative to what?\n\nAgain - what are the stakes in this battle?  One of the central plot devices is finding Luke - but once again, why?  How does he figure into the overall plan?  *Is* there an overall plan?  Having some more Jedi around would be nice, sure, but these bad guys have warships the size of small countries.  Again, the movie seems to be more concerned with scooting by on homage and nostalgia - *Isn't Luke cool?  Let's go find Luke!* - than making sense of its own universe.\n\nWorse, the lack of any exposition seems to render the entire climax of ROTJ entirely moot, since 30 years later nothing seems to have changed, nothing has been improved, nothing has been accomplished.  What's to celebrate in bringing down the Empire when 30 years later, nothing is really all that different?\n\nUnfortunately, these comments only touch on the extent to which the stakes and the setting are undercooked, and barely touches on the many, many, *many* other developments within the plot which only received scant treatment:\n\n* Finn has a change of heart and decides to do \"the right thing\" after a single battle scene, which never seems to trouble another stormtrooper.  For some reason.\n\n* Rey is able to suddenly develop extensive Force powers despite never having any of the training which occupied much of Luke's time in ESB.  Also, apparently just saying the word \"force\" is enough to give her super-strength.  Also she's an ace pilot and mechanic.  For some reason.\n\n* The bad guys are building yet another quasi-death star (but, like ...bigger this time) with yet another crucial weakness.  For some reason.\n\n* Chrometrooper, who gets built up as a badass, meekly agrees to shut down the shields and endanger both her own life, as well as thousands of others.  A bewildering change of character for a dedicated soldier that, again, happens ....for some reason. \n\n* There's also a brand new \"emperor\"  who seems pretty old  ...but who also acts an awful lot like a Sith Lord  ...so I *guess* he was around back when the original trilogy was going down  ... but aren't there supposed to be only two of them?  ...for some reason.\n\n* Just when he needs to, after being silent for god knows how long, R2-D2 suddenly breaks out the map to finding Luke.  For some reason.\n\nAnd none of *this* is even to mention the extent to which the movie merely coasted on recycled bits of creativity from the originals (no wonder Lucas liked it so much):\n\n* The plot device which kicks the movie off involves hiding information inside a plucky droid, who then treks across a desert planet before running by happenstance into a main character who ohbytheway happens to super powerful Force user.  Said main character's home is then incinerated by the bad guys.  Again.\n\n* Scary mask-wearing villain, dressed all in black, who clashes with others in the organization.  Again.\n\n* Cantina scene.  Again.\n\n* Wise, old, funny looking alien who provides guidance and counsel. Again.\n\n* Death of a major character at the hands of the primary villain at the climax of the film.  Again.\n\n* Scary looking holographic baddie pulling all the strings. Again.\n\nIt's a good movie, but Abrams took that the same approach to Star Wars that he did with *Into Darkness* - remix the original, update the effects and throw in a cautious twist or two.  It can make for a pretty entertaining outcome, but you walk away thinking more of what could have been, rather than what was.\n\nI like *A New Hope*, and so I liked this, because that's what I was.  \n\nI just badly wish for more.", "Very fun movie. But it was definitely at its best when it was fresh and unique. *The Force Awakes* was **extremely** derivative of *Star Wars* (*New Hope*). And the climax (lightsaber duel while Rebels attack Death Star 3.0 and a band of the rebellion's best soldier try to destroy the shields on the surface) was *Return of the Jedi*. Also, there was absolutely ZERO emotional connection when the planets of the New Republic were destroyed. Absolutely none.\n\nThey learned their lesson from Jar Jar: if you're going to have a quirky alien help the heroes on their quest, give it a soothing voice from Lupita Nyongo. \n\nTell me if my perception is warped, but TFA relied on more comic relief than any of the other 6 films. Finn, Poe (who was my favorite character and got such little screentime but it's okay), Han and Chewie, and the droids were persistent comic relief. \n\nThese are the only major negatives I can think of. Visually, gorgeous. The new lore and universe is exciting. I LOVE Rey. Total badass. \n\nOne last thing: Mark Hamill got SECOND BILLING behind Harrison Ford. Zero lines and 30-40 seconds on screen. Damn, son.\n\n**Edit**: tell me what you all thought of that scene on the freighter when they are attacked by the two pirate crews who are after Han and all those giant monsters escape. That was just really kooky, served little plot relevance other than...injuring Chewbacca. And showing Rey's ingenuity by saving Finn. To me, it just didn't fit into the overall film. \n\nEdit2: I've read a lot of thoughts on the monster chase scene, and agree with a lot. I totally forgot that it's a throwback to OT scenes like the space worm, Rancor lair, etc. But I thought the presentation was off. It served as back-to-back comedy scenes (after Rey, Finn, and BB-8 fixing the Falcon), almost 20 minutes of straight visual comedy and one-liners,  and it would have been a great opportunity to let the film breathe by slowing down. But thanks to your replies I now appreciate that scene more. ", "Another fucking Death Star. What the fuck Disney?", "Well you know what, as much as the prequels are despised by many, I think they had one thing over this one : They tried to be original while staying in that universe. This movie played it safe, very safe. I'll remember the pod racing scene and the final fight with Maul forever, but I had trouble remembering a huge scene from this one. Plenty of cool moments that's for sure, but nothing iconic to me. It lacked emotional punch to, even the supposedly tragic scenes like the destruction of the planets or Han's death.\n\nAlso Carrie Fisher acting was pretty lackluster, some of those scenes felts like a skit where they reunite the old cast on Fallon show or something. \n\n\nedit: The pacing really bothered me at times. I felt like Finn wanting out of the first order and deserting was very quick. He didn't hesitate to shoot and kill many of his old brother in arms as well, he showed compassion for the dead trooper during the assault but then kill many of them without showing any remorse ? That character development was weird, as well as the immediate trust Poe and him have, I thought the rebels and the troopers would pretty much hate each other or at least be suspicious, but this time they're already friendly in 10 seconds and they act like old high school friends almost immediatly.

Now do something different for 8 and 9.\n\nS**ky**walker So**lo**", "Man,  Kylo Ren turned out to be such a huge bitch. ", "So I'm mainly going to focus on the (force) positive ^sorry aspects of the film.\r\n\r\n**Plot:**\r\n\r\nYep. It's ANH 2.0. \r\n\r\nDon't care. They had some nice twists and it was a familiar story to ease us into a new era of the franchise and introduce us to the new characters. In all honesty, I think this is actually a strength. It just felt like a Star Wars film. The wonder in which the new generation were in awe of the force, the dogfights, the comically obvious weakness in the Death Star (at least it wasn't an exhaust port), it just felt right. Yet, they mixed up the status quo *just* enough to keep it all fresh, which leads me to\u2026\r\n\r\n**The new generation:**\r\n\r\nLove the new characters. They resemble the original trio, but really stand out individually as their own people. And the fact is, Finn and Rey, could've been really gimmicky characters. On the surface, they are just that. A soldier with a conscience, and gender bending the original status quo in a reboot, is something that has is done poorly all the time, but each character had a well-written, compelling story arc that had me invested in them right from the get go. Poe was also a really nice addition. He didn't get much screen time, but I really hope they expand on him, because Oscar Isaac was just such an energetic, fun presence every time he was on screen. I heard he's getting a spin-off or something?\r\n\r\n**The Old and New:**\r\n\r\nEverything blended nicely. The cast. The visuals. The cheesy screen wipes. It felt like a continuation and a relaunch at the same time. There was enough throwbacks to make me smile from ear to ear (Especially when Han said *I got a bad feeling about this!*), but they were organic enough to not disengage me from the film.\r\n\r\nOn a side note: I get a feeling BB-8 and R2D2 are going to be total bros in the next film and I can't wait to see it.\n\n**Kylo Ren:**\r\n\r\nWow. This has to be the most fresh aspect of the film. I was hesitant about where things were going when he first took off the mask. I had flashbacks to Hayden Christensen and his bit\u2013too-well-kempt locks and I thought that the whole side-arc had danger of becoming like Anakin in the prequels. He had a nice backstory, but still left a lot of mystery to him as a villain, questions were answered, but the process between getting from point-A to point B weren't, which I think will be fleshed out in time as his arc unfolds.\r\n\r\nNot too mention..\r\n\r\n**The Final Scene** ***Spoilers!***\r\n\r\nAnd that scene with Han. That was gold. From both actors. Harrison Ford killed it. Adam Driver killed it. The struggle from both characters was just so believable and the way they were fighting different demons made it so potent. Honestly, Hans overall arc in this film (and the series in total) had such a nice pace to it, that I was satisfied with how it panned out. It didn't feel like they killed him off because they had too, and they didn't ham fist it either. They let it play out in it's own space and didn't pause on it for too long either. It felt shocking because it happened, not because they forced it to happen.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR** I can't wait to watch this film 100x in theatres.", "I feel like JJ missed a great opportunity to reveal that Kylo Ren was actually Han and Leia's son later in the movie. Imagine if Snoke hadn't said it outright in the first half of the movie, and Han and Leia never talked about it. Instead, the reveal would have been when Han walked out onto the platform and yelled, \"Ben!\" Then, 30 seconds later, when Kylo asks what Han will see if he takes off the mask, Han says the same thing about the face of his son and the father-son relationship becomes clear.\n\nI think realizing the relationship at that point in the movie would have been way more dramatic. I realize it would have taken some work around in the script to have Han and Leia talk around it, but c'mon, you have to admit that would have been sick.\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "*The Force Is One Sad Ally...*\n\nI admit that I put too much thought into some things (Star Wars storylines) and not enough into others (becoming independently wealthy and retired). So, I will post my peace and return to my work...\n\nThe Force is the real problem in the Universe. It surrounds and binds people to a pretty sad life. In seven films there is nothing to show that it is positive or that it's something you would want in your life.\n\nThe central story arc throughout the Star Wars franchise is the fall and redemption of Annakin Skywalker. He falls in the prequels and keeps falling until his final redemption in ROTJ. At the end of that movie Annakin redeems himself by killing the Emperor/last Sith lord, thereby supposedly restoring balance to the Force, Luke reaches positive closure with his daddy issues, the refurbished Death Star is destroyed (again), the Empire falls, teddy bears are happy, Han and Leia get to bump intergalactic uglies somewhere off-screen. Sweetness.\n\nHOWEVER...30 years later we find out that the Empire was not quite dead yet, the Dark side is still all-powerful, Han and Leia have reverted to their ANH selves (with Han as a self-involved smuggler and Leia the warrior princess). During those 30 years they produced a son who turns out to be a thoroughly unstable tantrum prone poster boy of E-vil. The Millenium Falcon was stolen and left in a heap on Jakku. Then Luke, like Obi-wan and Yoda before him, disappears in self-imposed exile while the Dark side permeates the galaxy and builds yet another Death Star (only this Death Star is REALLY SUPER MEGA HUGE and goes to 11). R2-D2 has shut himself off in a non-responsive fit of droid depression, C-3P0 has a red arm from some bizarre gardening accident, and Chewbacca is still without Wookie-booty. It is a thoroughly depressing re-introduction to the self-sacrificing, valiant heroes of the Light side.\n\n*Seems like the Force is a crock, this does...*\n\nOf course the Dark and Light are polarities, but no matter who taps into the Force, their lives are dismal. The Jedi, by mandate, aren't supposed to have attachments to people or anything. This is what led to Annakin's downward spiral--being removed from his mother as a child, then falling in love with Padme and having nightmares about her death. It was what Yoda told Luke on Dagobah when he had visions of Han and Leia in danger. This attachment led Luke to the Cloud City so that he could get his hand lopped off and learn that Vader was his pater-familia. This mandate was repeated during ROTJ with Obi-wan's advice to Luke about Leia--bury your feelings. Luke's emotional attachment to Leia let Vader get under his skin and so Luke opened a can of Skywalker-Dark-side whoop-ass.\n\nThe Sith don't have it any easier. Each of them have some serious daddy issues and a helluva lot of problems with anger management. They seek masters who are super-evil and have no qualms about using their apprentices like a jumbo-roll of two-ply then replacing them when they are finished. The apprentices have typically killed their fathers like a gangland initiation to the Dark side, then they usually have to kill their masters in order to get a promotion to Sith Lord. Pretty sad and lonely life, really. I can imagine that Darth Sidious never got picked for kick-ball. Or Darth Maul didn't get birthday cards. Darth Tyranus probably never got a hug. I don't recall Darth Vader ever using jazz hands. They didn't have anything to live for but the power of being evil or in fear of their masters. All work and no play makes the Sith wear cranky-pants.\n\nYou would expect that Jedi Knights, the beacons of justice and the Light side would display an admirable moral fiber and fortitude during their trials and tribulations. But what does Yoda, Obi-wan, and Luke do when faced with defeat and disappointment? They run away. Far, far, away. And they hide. Meanwhile, the Dark side gets stronger, evil spreads across the galaxy and whammo! the minions of the Dark side construct a massive, but poorly secured mega-weapon in plain sight of the Republic (3 times). When the Jedi masters are found they need to be prodded into action. Why is it that the Dark side always seems to be proactively addressing recruitment and expansion concerns, while the Light is always mopey and passive?  \n\nStar Wars exists in a strange Universe and the Force does not reward the people who do \"right\" thing and fight for the \"Light\" side. Just by the nature of Western story-telling it should be expected that the Light side had some advantages over the Dark side. It's part of the hero mythology--you go through some hell to fight the good fight, then get to go home and nail the Prom Queen or King. But not with the Force. The entire downfall of the Republic and rise of the Sith lies directly with Yoda. He was unable to detect Darth Sidious/the Emperor or Darth Tyranus standing in front of him. Yoda, as the oldest Muppet in the Jedi Order, who was one of the most powerful practitioners of the Force, was thwarted by the Sith right in front of him. He even lead Stormtroopers into battle. Royally screwed the pooch, Yoda did. And then Obi-wan shat the bed, from a certain point of view. He ignores countless warnings and signs that Annakin was a super-powerful half-boiled egg with severe anger management issues. Obi-wan handed the Emperor the sword by which he could lay waste to the Jedi Order and reign terror over the galaxy. Then Obi-wan and Yoda pass on their questionable training methodology and insight onto Luke, who somehow helped Ben Solo find the Dark side and become Kylo Ren so that he could wipe out the new Jedi order and murder his father. And if history doesn't repeat itself enough in the Star Wars storylines and especially the Skywalker bloodline--it doesn't take long to realize that Rey is most likely Luke's daughter, abandoned on Jakku when Luke high-tailed it to the far end of the galaxy. She is left on her own much in the same way Luke was separated from Leia and handed off to Owen and Barru on Tattoine. Rey grows up with daddy issues replete with all the typical seeds of another dysfunctional Jedi. The only difference is she didn't have an Aunt and Uncle who wound up getting flambeed over a couple of droids.\n\n Light side, Dark side--these matter not, because either way, all of the Force-wielding characters are miserable--riddled with isolation, guilt, doubt, fear, anxiety, anger, or hate. And each of them leave death, destruction, and pain in their wake. The Force brings out the worst in some and destroys the best in others. It is not your friend. It is not your ally. And I, for one, am happy that it is not with me--ever. I now believe the phrase, \"May the Force be with you,\" is really just a Lucasian euphemism for, \"May you get severely bent over.\"  If someone told me, \"May the Force be with you,\" I think I'd have to reply with, \"Oh yeah? Well, f--k you, too--and the Taun Taun you rode in on!\"", "Lifelong Star Wars fan checking in here who used to have a book case full of Zahn novels, seen it twice now. \n\nAll you need to know about Star Wars Episode 7 is that I had the biggest, most shit eating grin on my face the entire time while I sat on the edge of my seat. \n\nDoes it have some flaws? Yep. Absolutely. Half of the main plot (the Resistance/First Order stuff) feels very ANH 2.0, EXTREMELY well executed but uninspired, verging on the cusp of derivative (but not quite sinking that far). Phasma is woefully underused, definitely hope we see more of her. And the overall state of the universe, while basically stated, isn't presented as well as it could have been. What was the relationship between the republic and the first order? How was the Resistance related to the Republic? How much power does the first order wield in the galaxy? Plus I would have liked to have seen some more variety in planets. Etc. So yeah, some flaws, some definite nitpicks, some very valid criticism to make. \n\nIs it an amazing, emotional, exhilarating reintroduction to a galaxy a galaxy far, far away? Does it succeed in spite of its flaws? ABSOLUTELY. In fact, I think the fact that I love so much of the film makes the few flaws that exist that much more obvious. \n\nBut to be honest... Playing it safe to reintroduce the saga and heal some of the previous wounds may be exactly what the franchise needed. Sure it might not be exactly what I, specifically, would have done with the film; but Star Wars isn't just my film. It's everyone's film. And what we got is a big \"welcome back\".\n\nThe new cast is just perfect, and so well written. The new characters are terrific, the old characters are respectfully integrated without over shadowing the newbies, and the second half to the main plot (the story of the Jedi, the Skywalker lineage, etc) feels new and exciting and VERY well set up so far. The \"family drama\" that George Lucas classified as \"what Star Wars is actually about\" is very, very, VERY much in the DNA of this movie without making the universe feel small, like the prequels did. And the acting has never been this strong, nuanced, and human feeling in a Star Wars film. I want to give specific props but really, ALL of the new leads just knock it out of the park with their performances. \n\nThe shroud of mystery and seeds of the rest of the saga feel firmly planted thus far. We have an amazing set of protagonists with an arc, a psychologically interesting antagonist with an arc, and a forward momentum to the story that I haven't felt in years. And my gosh are there some iconic moments in this film. The lightsaber battle in the snow, the tie fighter ground attack on Jakku, the death of Han, the first appearance of Skywalker in decades... It's all resonating quite well with me. \n\nAnd let me just say... This movie has the best opening and closing shot of any Star Wars movie, bar none. The juxtaposition of the planet and the star destroyer was ominous as all hell, and seeing the real stormtrooper armour again made me giddy. And that final scene will never not give me chills. The quiet intimacy, the mythic feel, the return of Luke Skywalker... What an incredible moment to end on. Hamill looked amazing, haunted yet powerful, and keeping him away (but alive) for this film is a brilliant move IMO. \n\nTHIS is how you bring CGI into the Star Wars universe. There was a TON of CGI in this film, just as much as any prequel, but it all felt grounded and never took me out of the film. I don't know if it was all the location shooting, the practical effects, the visual design elements, or whatever but it all just had a level of consistency that I haven't seen in a Star Wars film in years. And most importantly, it retained that \"used future\" look of the originals, a world where old and new technology co exist, where the past history of the universe is treated with a mythic and epic feeling of discovery. It really does feel like a tale that resides within a larger narrative, one humble story within the larger narrative of a massive galaxy far far away. \n\nThis movie had a LOT to accomplish. It had to earn back the goodwill lost by the prequels, reintroduce the Galaxy and classic characters, bring in a new cast of heroes and villains that resonate, tell a stand alone story while setting up the seeds for the rest of the new saga, feel like a Star Wars film while trying some new things, deliver on 30+ years of hype while still moving along at a good clip. This is a massive amount of weight to put on one film, but I think TFA checked off an astonishing amount of its laundry list. I feel that in context to episode 8 and 9, it will resonate even more in this regard. Does it play things safe? I would say so, at least regarding the \"stand alone\" plot of the film. I understand why it does however, and this is probably the right time to do it. It hits all the Star Wars notes to bring the Galaxy back, while setting the stage for our new heroes to take the story in wildly different directions. The real test of this saga will be how Rian Johnson handles the next chapter; a rehash of Empire Strikes Back is going to REALLY fail as a film, tank the saga and would retroactively cheapen Episode 7. \n\nFor now, however? This is pretty much exactly what the franchise needed right now, and I'm fucking buzzed. It felt like a big welcome back, a familiar adventure to usher me into a new era, and I can't WAIT to see what's next. Star Wars is back for the first time in thirty years and it feels INCREDIBLE.\n\nI usually don't write this much in an r/movies review thread, but fuck it, it's Star Wars. Thanks for reading this far if you have :)\n\nTLDR; I'm very happy, very emotional, and eager for what comes next. 524 days until Episode 8! \n\nBONUS; my new personal ranking of the films;\n1. Empire Strikes Back\n2. A New Hope\n3. The Force Awakens\n4. Return of the Jedi\n5. All the prequels\n\nEDIT: misspelled a word, dang autocorrect \n\nEDIT 2: Thank you for the gold, anonymous! ", "Was anyone else expecting Luke to force pull the lightsaber from the snow, instead of Rey?", "I have a feeling that a lot of you aren't comic nerds, but if you get a chance and see it in your local book store/comic store, check out Shattered Empire. It's a four issue story that gives the basic set up for the force awakens. I'm sure that there's going to be more, like how C3P0 got that red arm, but it's a good starting point to understand how the star destroyer wrecked on Jakku.", "I liked the movie! It\u2019s not the best Star Wars movie IMO, or even my favourite one, but it is a very solid entry into the pantheon of Star Wars movies and a fairly good foundation upon which this sequel trilogy will be built. Looking forward to Rian Johnson\u2019s Episode VIII.\n\nOh and did anyone else figure out that the Stormtrooper whom Rey pulls a Jedi mind trick on [was played by Daniel Craig](http://time.com/4154931/star-wars-the-force-awakens-cameo-surprise/)? He has a very distinctive gait (a swagger, some might say) that I associated with Craig. And of course I\u2019d recognize his voice anywhere. :)\n\n***The good things***\n\n* I liked almost all of the new characters. I think the film did a pretty good job of introducing us to all of them. My personal favourites of the new characters: John Boyega as Finn, who was an incredibly charismatic and endlessly watchable leading man (though many of us knew that already from *Attack the Block*), Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron (though I wish he was in the movie more), and Domhnall Gleeson as the scenery-chomping General Hux. I did like Adam Driver\u2019s Kylo Ren too, although I thought he seemed less threatening when he didn\u2019t have his mask on and was using his unmodified voice, and I found it fun that Hux and Kylo hated each other.\n* I do have to say that Harrison Ford returning as Han Solo, alongside Chewbacca, was probably the greatest thing about this movie for me. Arguably I am biased since I am more obsessed with Harrison Ford than the average person is, but every scene with Han and Chewie in *The Force Awakens* was gold. I knew about Han\u2019s death awhile ago thanks to /r/StarWarsLeaks and so I wasn\u2019t as emotionally distraught during that scene as some might have been (although Han yelling \u201cBEN\u201d was so heartbreaking), but I\u2019m still pretty bummed out that we\u2019re not going to get a Luke/Leia/Han reunion in these movies. That\u2019s some George R R Martin-level emotional cruelty right there.\n* Love me some John Williams score, although I think the movie could have used something epic and orchestral like \u201cDuel of the Fates\u201d from *The Phantom Menace*. Nonetheless it was great music throughout. Really enjoyed the use of the Love Theme from *The Empire Strikes Back* for the Han/Leia scenes, almost brought a tear to my eye (I really like Han and Leia ok).\n* Anything involving X-wings and TIE fighters doing combat was great. Loved the Resistance X-wings arriving at Maz Kanata\u2019s castle by the lake, that was very beautiful to watch.\n\n***The not-so-good things***\n\n* I am not a fan of Death Star 3.0. Hell, they even lampshaded the similarity of the Starkiller Base to the two previous Death Stars with Han\u2019s line about it being bigger \u2013 but honestly I hope this is the last time they reuse this plot. The other similarities between this movie and *A New Hope* (and there are MANY) didn\u2019t bother me too much, though.\n* Presumably they\u2019ll be answering this question in a future installment, but Rey\u2019s ability to use the Force in the course of what seemed like a day seemed a bit too sudden and accelerated for me. The things she was doing with her mind and a lightsaber were the kind of things Luke had to train for the entirety of *The Empire Strikes Back* and the time in between that and *Return of the Jedi* to learn. But like I said, hopefully we will learn that Rey underwent some Jedi training as a kid or something in a future movie. Luke certainly did seem to know her when they saw each other at the end.\n* It\u2019s not the first time this complaint has been levelled against a JJ Abrams movie, but I thought the film may have contained a few too many chase scenes. *So many chase scenes.* The Rathtar scene felt especially random to me. I also didn\u2019t think the writing and pacing was great, either \u2013 not all of the gag lines and callbacks worked for me, some of them seemed too forced (for lack of a better word). I did have high hopes for the writing too since Lawrence Kasdan wrote one of my favourite films of all time (*Raiders of the Lost Ark*) and my favourite Star Wars film.\n* I was a little disappointed at how underused Captain Phasma and Lor San Tekka ended up being. Apparently Kathleen Kennedy has gone on record as saying that Phasma will have a significantly larger role in VIII and IX, so I guess I can look forward to that, but I was really hoping Max von Sydow would get a nice meaty role to sink his teeth into. Could easily have seen him as a Star Wars legend alongside the likes of Alec Guinness and Christopher Lee. Maz Kanata also came and went rather quickly, for some reason.\n\n", "The first words spoken in the film by Lor San Tekka addressing the audience were something along the lines of: \"this will help to make things right again\". He handed Poe a part of the map to find Skywalker. \n\nI believe this was JJ's hidden message to the fans. ", "This was the absolute worst piece of garbage I have ever seen. This film felt like a parody of Star Wars. Please tell me there are sane people who share the same opinion as me. Sitting through this movie was pure torture. The characters were terrible. The dialogue was terrible. The story was terrible. \n\nThere's not a single thing I liked about this film. ", "Did anyone else think that is was going to be Luke using the force to put up the lightsaber after Kylo disarmed Finn? ", "I want to point out that I think people are making too big a deal about Rey developing her powers and beating Kylo Ren. This is one of the most common complaint and it's being blown way out of proportion.\n\nShe's obviously a prodigy (maybe even more so than Luke or Anakin) and people seemed to miss subtle things that led to Kylo Ren not fighting as well as he should have:\n\n- Kylo had just killed his father, regardless of whether or not you liked how his internal struggle was handled, *he was going through a stuggle* and had just killed his father. He was probably not in the best state of mind.\n\n- The film went to pretty great lengths (almost excessive I might add) to show how strong Chewie's particular blaster was, I mean seriously there was like 4 scenes each one featured stormtropers getting blasted several feet away in the air and explosions and shit. People seem to forgot Kylo was hit by one of these blasts and he was very obviously weakened (hence him keeping pounding his side during the forest fight)\n\n- He once again suffered *another* injury at the hands of Finn who managed to cut his shoulder/arm(?).\n\n- He was stated to not have completed his training. He's obviously no Vader, not in talent or skill(yet). His insecurity is one of his highlighted characterizations of the films. My point is, he isn't as powerful as a lot of people are thinking (sure I mean stopping the blaster in midair is cool, but his lightsaber dueling seems even inferior to Anakins in episode 2)\n\nWas Rey beating him a little too rushed and maybe unearned? Perhaps. Could they have made it so that she struggled a bit more to beat him? Probably how I would do it. But ultimately with all the above reasons I listed above I don't find it completely *outrageous* that she beat him. People are blowing waay out of proportion in general. Saying like she's a force master overnight, come on. She is definitely not on level of Anakin or Obi Wan in the prequel trilogies. Her mind trick took her multiple tries too it's not like she just did it smoothly immediately, she's just a prodigy when it comes to the force (probably a Skywalker).\n\nOverall the film was good. I know people didn't appreciate the overabundance of similarity to A New Hope, but that's frankly just the result of the studio playing it safe (which can you blame them after the prequels?) \n\nIt was well executed for what it was and breathed new life into the series and was entertaining to watch. Even the critics pretty much say the same thing and they aren't caring about dumb and minor, petty flaws. So although not perfect, the film set out to do what it was meant to do. Overall a good installment in the series and a million times better than the prequels. It's the first \"Star Wars\" feeling movie in more than 30 years.", "Absolutely loved it. Rey is my new favorite Star Wars character. ", "Daisy Ridley is going to be an absolute superstar after everyone sees this movie. The character of Rey is so wonderfully written. You really fall in love with her and care for her, and it's amazing to have a resourceful, non-sexualized female lead who is regarded as an equal to every man in the film while still not shying away from the fact that she's a female. Daisy Ridley acted the character incredibly well and Abrams' direction was fantastic as well.", "I'm still not quite sure how Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher genetically combined to form Adam Driver.", "I honestly hated it. The plot makes no sense, the call backs are all forced, the characters are poorly acted, their dialogue is cringe worthy, and continuity errors abound. BB-8 was cool though. \n\nEdit: People seem to think think think I mean that you're not supposed to like it. I think it's crap, but I'm not telling you what to think. You're actually allowed to form your own opinions independent of mine.", "Ill repost my feelings on the movie here on this discussion thread:\n\nSo... I've just been to the cinema and seen the new star wars movie, and I really hate to do this.... but the movie just isn't good. What it does is it provides a ton of nostalgia fan-service, reminding you of the old trilogy, they made a big effort to make the new movie look and run exactly like the \"the new hope\".\nAlso it has a strong opening with lots of excitement and an interesting (though predictable) plot progression.\n\nAll this sounds great right, well it is and I was sitting in the theater feeling like I get why everyone is rating it so highly. Then the next act happened and from there it just spiraled downwards to a point where i'd prefer if they had just shown me the prequels instead.\n\nI won't spoil anything (read my spoilers for that), however I'll try to convey why I think it was terrible:\n\n1. There are huge plot holes\n2. The world feels small and you feel like the story takes place in a bubble that revolves around these exact characters.\n3. That new sith (Kylo something) is not only boring and forgettable he is also an annoying emo kid. Basically no character growth happens and in general we never learn much about him (as a character)\n4. Those plot holes will give you brain cancer if think about them, I suggest watching the movie while drunk.\n5. The story is copy pasted scene for scene from a new hope, even when it doesn't make sense. (this is \"partly positive\" because you will get one heck of a nostalgia trip, and a new hope is pretty good so even a bad copy of it is still fine)\n \n\n[Plot hole 1 spoilers](#s \"I am warning you, reading this will spoil it for you. So anyway lets begin: In the movie we find out that the bad guys have built a giant planet sized gun(of course), and the resistance is like we need to get rid of it but first we must destroy its shields, so Finn(the black guy) volunteers and says he knows exactly how to do this. But when they reach the planet then he is like 'actually I lied I have no clue, but I am sure we'll figure it out somehow', and low and behold they run across some storm trooper middle-manager, who just happens to have access to turn off the ENTIRE planets defense. (One person from one console, and none in the control tower is alerted of this or even cares)\")\n\n[Plot hole 2 spoilers](#s \"Next up we have one that is just really really retarded, basically we find out Rey has the force powers. Which is all fine and good, however they explicitly state that she has never received any training. But they REALLY needed to have jedi sword fighting in the movie, so what we get is a fight between her and the Kylo guy where she wins, I don't know about you but who do you think will win a novice who has never even held a sword or a master training his whole life?. Oh wait.. it gets even more retarded, remember that useless Finn guy who has zero jedi powers and has also never held a sword before, well he also fights Kylo and end up wounding him. **Faceplam**. On a side Note: This also goes into the whole: thing that the Kylo the emo kid sith is so pathetic that you just sit there cringing at his shame \")\n\n[Plot hole 3 spoilers](#s \"And finally (there are probably more holes) we get to the plot on how they destroy the death st... i mean death planet. A single small base placed 500m blow the surfice of a giant planet, where shooting it destroys the whole planet, did I mention it is unguarded.. It's unguarded they literally just stroll around inside while placing bombs. The resolution is very similar to star wars: Phantom menace where anakin just flies in and destroys the whole base, but unlike that one it wasn't by mistake\")\n\nPeople seems to be in denial of this movie I mean especially this Chris guy, the 3. movie (revenge of the jedi) was a thousands times better than this. And Honestly even something like the prequels had a grander feel to it.\n\nI get it people watch a movie and thinks it's awesome because everyone else is says it is and you still have the rush from the cinema magic, but then a week pass by and you start to consider the movie and the more you think about it the more and more stupid it becomes.\n\nMy score is: 5/10, 8/10 for the first half hour and 2-3/10 for the rest. (and A+ for nostalgia effort, D- for plot and story effort)\n\nTLDR: Bad movie only watch if you like nostalgia (might be enough)", "The bridge scene was done so well.  The way Han looked into his sons eyes... holding his sons face for the last time, before falling down to his death.  I was so engrossed and the theater was dead silent... I had to do my best to maintain myself it was so heartbreaking.", "I thought this movie was *so* close to being really great, so close. \n\nThe first act is incredible, both from the perspective of world-building and introducing the new characters. The world of Star Wars feels alive for the first time in decades thanks to an actual physical presence of sets and creatures, but more importantly characters that actually emote and have solid dialogue to work with. I LOVED all the new characters, they are so likable and well realised. Whether it\u2019s Finn\u2019s morality crisis as a Stormtrooper or Rey\u2019s lonely life on Jakku, there\u2019s enough gaps in the character\u2019s history to make them truly interesting and compelling. Kylo-Ren\u2019s backstory is super intriguing and I can\u2019t wait to see what they do with him in the future.  Even General Hux was delightfully over the top. You know they\u2019ve nailed the characters when everyone is able to talk about them in such detail already. The movie is really at it\u2019s best in it\u2019s quieter moments between characters and when the movie allows the audience to observe and explore it\u2019s environment. \n\nWhich brings me to my issues with the movie: the movie moves too quick. JJ Abraham\u2019s has never been strong in the story department with a reliance on contrivances to move the story along and this is no different. I don\u2019t think he knows how to move from one scene to another without an action scene and it\u2019s almost too much. Unlike the older movies (and even the prequels to an extent) there\u2019s often no time to breathe, and we just keep moving and moving. JJ is always in a hurry to get to the action setpieces and in doing so we lose a lot of the Star Wars essence. No one starts off as inexperienced, everyone is a pro so we can get a cool light saber battle at the end. No one has to work for each other\u2019s trust, the protagonists are almost immediately friends. \nMy other major issues, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s everyone else\u2019s, but the A New Hope comparisons. I don\u2019t mind story wise, it\u2019s beat-for-beat, or that even some of the characters and plot points are near identical (I was fine with it up to the Death Star 3.0), but the constant callbacks and \u201chomages\u201d were a bit on the nose and grating. We get it, you were also in a trash compactor, haha. And the time where you were flying at 12? Great, it\u2019s in the past. If there were one or two of them I\u2019d be fine but it\u2019s pretty constant. I get that it\u2019s supposed to be a passing of the torch and we can still celebrate the older characters, but constantly banking on nostalgia felt cheap. \n\nI sound overly negative when I talk about it, but it\u2019s still a really solid movie. They got the essentials right, and I can\u2019t wait to see where Rian Johnson takes all these great characters.\n", "I'm excited for this new trilogy. Like many have already expressed, this is largely due to what I feel was outstanding creation and performance of character. One thing that got me more hopeful than anything else was the climactic scene that we expect of every Star Wars movie - the lightsaber duel.\n\nConsider this: \n\n**A New Hope** featured Obi Wan v. Vader. \"The circle is now complete...\" A duel where we see the close of a relationship between two seasoned masters of the force. This is a calm duel. Obi-Wan gives himself to the force knowing that Luke will champion the light. Luke's struggle to carry out justice v. revenge begins here, and his journey as a Jedi begins here. A new circle begins.\n\n**Empire Strikes Back** featured Luke v. Vader. \"...but you are not a Jedi yet.\" A duel between a fledgling Jedi and a master of the Dark Side. This battle ferocious, violent in its end. Vader is collected, menacing. Luke is wild and craving to prove himself. We come to understand more of Luke's brash nature - this will come in the way of his pursuit to become a true Jedi. Vader reveals the lacking in our protagonist as he becomes not only Luke's source of anger but the source of his fear - \"No...*I* am your father.\". We see that our protagonist has much to learn.\n\n**Return of the Jedi** featured Luke v. Vader. \"Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you. The conflict.\" A duel where we see, yet again, two masters of the force. It is a battle of juxtapositions - of calm and terrible. There is a division within both characters in their relationship to the force. Vader, of the dark side, is called into the light, as he is unable to kill his son. Luke, of the light, is called into the dark, as he ultimately uses his rage and a emotional outpouring to defeat his father. However, the Jedi in Luke comes to realize what is birthed through hate when he sees his father's prosthetic arm. The light is victorious in our protagonist as Luke refuses the way of the dark side, it is victorious as Anakin refuses to allow his son to die at the hands of Sidious and joins the force.\n\nThe prequels do this a little messily. Fights do not reflect the characters but are acrobatic showpieces. To summarize quickly:\n\n**Phantom Menace** - the birth of a master who is not yet ready to be a master and the adoption of a padawan. A cycle birthed.\n\n**Attack of the Clones** - a youngling Jedi fueled by rage and self-confidence, a master who is flawed, but adamant in his teachings of patience. Together, they are defeated by the dark.\n\n**Revenge of the Sith** - two seasoned masters of the force, two parts to a house divided. One has become in tune with the will of the light (as shown in the defeat of Grievous) and the other has been consumed by hate and an ambition for recognition.\n\nI feel that with **The Force Awakens**, we have the beginning of a very clear journey. One that will ultimately lead to an incredible collision of light and dark.\n\nKylo Ren longs to be worshipped, pursues the power of the dark side. As we see, he fails to be a true champion of the dark. As the light calls to him, and he yet sees right from wrong, he is gnawed by guilt. The murder of his father, his defeat at the hands of Rey - these may be the building blocks for him to embrace the darkness. He is a budding Sith, who very revealing when it comes to the way of the dark side of the force - it does not truly rely on power or a conquering of personal demons, but is an overwhelming submission to fear.\n\nRey is aware of her fear and her longing. It rules over many of her decisions. She is an emotional character who may prove resistant to the ways of the force. She clings to ignorance and it has paralyzed her for much of her life, she has long waited, not pursued. But she longs for more, and her adventure begins with her first steps of discovery as the force calls her out of Jakku. But once Rey encounters what she had been looking for - the truth of who she is and where she has come from, she runs from it. Nevertheless, she is beginning to feel the light. And when she allows the force to be her will, allows it to take her life into its way, she becomes powerful. She is one who shows the hints of a Jedi.\n\nThis film has a messy, untidy battle between a boy who does not truly understand the way of the Sith and a girl who has only begun to explore the way of the Jedi. The two fight as children, not as those who understand the ways of the sides of the force they represent. The light only wins as its champion, for the first time, reveals to herself the reality of the force's power.\n\nI am excited now as we begin a journey to see these two mature as Jedi and Sith. I think the right pieces have been put into place to see the growing power of the force. At this trilogy's close, I would very much like to see a battle between these two characters. Two characters who have grown from fledgling duelists into clashing masters of the force, dark and light.\n\n*I'm just a fan. This is all according to my opinion, which may or may not be agreed with.\n*edits - spelling", "I've been a fan of Star Wars since the mid-90's. The prequels were disappointing and this movie was \"fun\", but its no excuse for what was otherwise a huge letdown. Rather than \"ur just bitching turn ur brain off XD!\" stuff, here's a concise list of the issues with this film. I hope we can keep it civil. \n\nThis was just a remake of episode four, I don't even consider it it's own movie. JJ remade ET as super 8 and wrath of khan as Into darkness. This movie is no different\n\n-having another Death Star was unforgivable, having a hole that you shoot into to blow it all up again was even more unforgivable\n-JJs insistence to stay away from prequel complaints harmed the movie. People whine about confusing political stuff in the prequels, but this was the only Star Wars movies that left me confused. Whets the relationship between the first order and resistances? What's the resistance? Why isn't the republic fighting the first order? Where is the republic? What were those planets the Death Star 3 blew up?\n\n-people fighting sith lords and doing Jedi mind tricks without training. What was the point of the Jedi order even. Rey was bad enough but fucking Finn managed to wound him. The Force isn't a X-Men superpower that you can just do, lightsabers take years of training. Kylo was wounded yes, but to be able to have so much trouble against Rey, nevermind Finn, who both had 0 training, just made no sense.\n\n-just x-wings and tie fighters in the lamest space battle of the series. At least the prequels had interesting weapons each movie, this was just boring and interfered with logic. Why didn't they use Y-Wings in the final space battle? Why couldn't we see some cool improved Imperial weapons used out of desperation like TIE-tanks and droid fighters? Was it because JJ thinks it's not nostalgic enough?\n\n-everything was so uninspired from JJs inability to make his own movie. I expected a new vader and emperor but Christ he took carbon copying to a new level. Rey was not-Luke, orange alien was not-yoda, nux was not-Tarkin, Poe was not-Leia, BB was not-R2 , Finn was a more bumbling and self righteous Han, Phasma was a not-Boba Fett. Han had a violent confrontation with not-Greedo. Even the planets were copied. from not-Tattoine with its own not-Jawas to not-Yavin. the not-mos eisley Catina scene complete with its own silly alien band was so ridiculously shameless I dunno how it made the final cut\n\n-people seeing each other at the precisely right moment on vessels the size of planets. The force guiding them and etc only works for so long\n\nThe main problem though is ultimately just this being episode 4 with some variable changes and an uncharismatic and unattractive sat. Everything was by the books, bland, and uninteresting. \n\nPalpatine at his most awkward was far better than fucking snoke, and don't even get me started on Ron weasley vs Tarkin. The lack of world building could have been compensated with an original story and better leads.\n\nHeir to the empire did a much better and interesting sequel to Jedi 20 years ago. This was a big disappointment like i expected, granted it managed better than I thought. 5 > 4 > 6 > 3 > 7 > 1 > 2. It's a shame the old EU was thrown out for uninspired banal remakes. Stuff the EU commonly got bashed for (i.e. Suncrusher and Jacen Solo going Sith) ended up in even worse forms in this movie (Death Star 3, Kylo Ren). \"It's a fun movie turn your brain off XD\" does not excuse the total lack of creativity.\n\nOverall, the fact that this movie is not even an exaggeration of [this image] (http://i.imgur.com/7tZMIAm.jpg) should say enough.", "Who the hell is snoke? How would the new republic not know the first order is creating a giant weapon planet? Who runs the galaxy, the republic or the first order. Why can a goldfish act better than Carrie fisher? ", "A few posts have referenced the humour, but not one of my favourite moments when Chewie was being attended to by the medic and she said he must have been very brave. ", "\"Oh wow, The Force Awakens was great! What a fun movie! I wonder what everyone else thinks\"\n\n*begins to log onto Reddit*\n\n\"Oh man I'm sure there's gonna be some great discussions about peoples theories on Supreme Leader Smoke and Rey's parents and C3PO's red arm!\"\n\n*Begins to scroll through comments*\n\n\"O- Oh my god... Th- the nitpicking! The listing of broad aspects from the movie as bad with no context to back up their reasonings! The demands for every new question to have been answered by the time the credits rolled as if this wasn't the first movie in a trilogy!\"\n\nDid everyone walk into this movie with a notepad that just said \"CONS\" at the top and write down everything they saw? The most baffling compliant I'm seeing (and there are many, like the moron complaining about bounty hunters having Scottish accents) is people complaing about not every question being answred. What version of A New Hope did you guys watch that had an answer for everything? That's a large part of the fun of Star Wars! Guessing what the backstory is for all of these interesting creatures and characters! Besides that, isn't having a movie hold your hand and walk you through every single thing that  happens exhausting?", "Anyone else notice the corridor from Cloud City during Ren's vision upon touching the saber? Very nice touch, I half expected Vader to jump out and take a swing at her! Wasn't 100% sure I grasped the significance of the rest of the vision, could definitely make out Yoda's voice though in the blur of sound! Anyone have any theories on the vision?", "Overall, Disney and JJ played this one safe. JJ is a super Star Wars nerd, and with Kasdan and Kennedy, they first had the objective of cleaning up the prequels. I believe their first goal was to bring back the nostalgia for all of the old Star Wars fans, and they nailed it. They filmed on location every chance they got, minimal green screens, CGI to enhance makeup and live models, (not CGI just because you can).\n\nYes, they used plot points from A New Hope, but in some instances, I believe this was a direct wink to the audience...including little points and major plot points. When the resistance is gathered around the holodeck looking at the planet killer, and they are discussing it's weaknesses, Han says something to the effect of \"There's always a weakness, there's always a shield generator that needs to go down, etc.\" I believe JJ is acknowledging this fact straight to the audience.\n\nAlso, Rian Johnson who is directing Episode VIII, is also a super star wars nerd and is very grounded in his direction as well. He even asked and worked with JJ to implement things in A Force Awakens to set the seed for things he wants to do in 8. Because of this, it's very hard to judge 7 on it's on. Remember, with a New Hope, Lucas didn't know if he would get to make more Star Wars movies, so he made Star Wars into a movie that could stand on it's on. A force Awakens CAN'T stand on it's on...There has never been a cliffhanger ending like this before.\n\nActing: I think all of the actors were on point. I actually think the characterization of Ren was excellent. He worshipped the dark side of his grandfather, believing Vader to be the actual man and not knowing who Anakin was (through manipulation through Snoke). He envisioned himself as a bad ass behind the helmet, but he was far from it. He gave into tantrums when things didn't go his way, and upon taking off the helmet, we see what he really is: a scared, self doubting boy. Of course he had trouble in the light saber duel against Finn/Rey. It was in his character, he was not a badass as he envisioned himself...AND he was injured by a gun the writers made a point to be very powerful. He also kept hitting himself after strikes...(I think this was saying like \"I'm better than this, I'm better than this.\"...but he wasn't). He also didn't die, he was retrieved and taken to Snoke to complete his training. \n\nRey,Finn,Poe were characterized well, and of course Han was the same guy we remember. I was scared Harrison Ford wouldn't be able to tap into the same character, but he pulled it off without a hitch...a very pleasant surprise. Carrie Fisher didn't actually have that much to do, but she was serviceable. The times haven't been as kind to Carrie as Harrison Ford, there is just no way around it. She wasn't as lively or headstrong as the original trilogy, but she didn't really have to be.\n\nTidbits: I've been trying to figure out who Rey is. Is she Han and Leia's daughter, is she Luke's daughter, is she a young trainee Luke was training and had to send away? I'm leaning towards Luke's daughter:\n-Her having and putting on the X-wing helmet at the beginning.\n-Her being a natural pilot. In a New Hope, Luke says to Han about flying the Millennium Falcon \"You bet I could.\" Well, Rey actually has to and outflies two TIE fighters.\n-Luke's lightsaber calls to her. She gets flashbacks of Luke, and being taken away.\n-She is able to use the Force. Is this caused by latent memories awakened by the lightsaber or by Ren poking around in her head? Had she been trained as a kid? Why couldn't she remember?\n-She comments she thought Luke was a myth and Han a legend. Han tells her that all of the stories she heard were all true...again, why can't she remember?\n-She makes the comment about Han being the father she never had...and Han seems to recognize something in her. Does he see himself in her or does he see his old friend Luke in her?\n\nAs I said earlier, I believe these questions will be answered. It's very hard to judge this movie on it's on because of the direct cliff hanger.\n\nFinn is not a clone...he was taken from his family at a young age and had forced behavior modification to become a storm trooper. It obviously didn't take however, because he just wanted \"to do the right thing.\"\n\nI'm mad that more characterization wasn't given to Poe...as we were to believe he was dead and then he just reappears an hour later. But we do know what type of character Poe is...through his smart ass remarks in the beginning and his ace pilot skills, I believe he will take on a much larger role going forward.\n\nOverall:\n\nI really, really liked it. As I said, I believe JJ and Kasdan had an initial goal: that was to re-acquire all of the old star wars fans that Lucas pissed off first and foremost. THEY HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK on that goal. They also laid a solid foundation going forward, and most importantly, they are getting everyone interested in the Star Wars universe again. I mean we are on a 7 page thread discussing who's daughter Rey is. Whether you like it or not, you are discussing it, which is a triumph in itself. The mythos is back. The FUN is back.\n\nYes, old plot points were reused, and MANY parallels can be drawn from A New Hope and A Force Awakens. I think some of that is JJ's inner nerd taking control from A New Hope and saying \"I like this but I would have done that a little differently\" and he was able to fulfill his wishes.\n\nI am probably going to see it 2-3 more times in theaters, but I am very excited about the direction it is going, and can't wait for Episode 8, which is another accomplishment (how many people after The Phantom Menace were like...screw Attack of the Clones...not even interested?) It is in good hands with Rian Johnson at the next helm, and I believe questions will be answered.\n\n\n***about the Light Saber duel*** Loved it. It was so grounded. You didn't have someone doing 10 backflips into 5 summersaults just to make one swing. To me it was a believable fight between someone injured who is not as good as he thinks he is, someone who has been conditioned all of his life for battle, and someone who knew how to fight because she grew up alone and had to take care of herself in the harsh wastelands of Jakuu (plus someone whose latent ability to use the FORCE, had been AWAKENED.)\n-There was not an over saturation of Light Sabers. There were just TWO. One built by a Jedi and one not built correctly by someone who has not completed his training. The light saber is a mythical elegant weapon again.\n\nEDIT: fixed the formatting, hopefully (but probably not)", "First of all, I don't care one bit that they borrowed heavily from A New Hope. It worked perfectly for this film. This was a true Star Wars movie. Within the first twenty minutes all the pain of the prequels had just washed away. It was a little overwhelming just to be sitting in a theater watching a new Star Wars movie. I loved all the new characters, and I'm really not sure which one of the new trio I liked the best. Old sage Luke looked amazing, and I'm really glad that we at least got a look at him. BB-8 was a great addition to the franchise. As much as I love R2-D2, he can be kind  of a snarky dick at times while BB-8 comes off much more as a bro. My only slight gripe was that I wished Leia had a bit more of her old sassyness. I know she's older, but she was a little too mild for my tastes.", "Is Mark Hamill the first \"main character\" actor ever to have more lines in the trailer than the film itself? ", "I loved the movie so much. Two important cons, at least to me:\n\n1. I did not like the old characters as much as I wanted to. Han, Leia, etc...it's awesome to see them back in action BUT it didn't feel like they'd really *progressed* in the 30-40 years between the first movies and now. It feels blatantly obvious that, aside from the major plot point of Kylo, they were put in just to be safe. Funny enough, C3PO's introduction is an exaggerated example of how I saw everyone else's introduction. Excluding Luke, since we haven't seen much of him yet.\n\n2. I didn't care at all for the sound design in this movie. It felt...lumpy? Like, very treble-oriented music which made bassy ship-zooms kind of jarring.\n\nOther than that, it was fantastic. Kylo Ren being practically a scrawny teen and mentally unstable made for a great villain because of how unpredictable he can become when using the force.", "I really feel like Kylo Ren's problem is just that he needs a girlfriend. He's Ben Solo for far too long.", "Kylo Ren:\nMask On = Badass | \nMask Off = Meh", "Han's death would have been a lot more effective if they hadn't telegraphed it 15 minutes before. ", "Anyone else realize that Han was done for as soon as  princess asked him to bring their son home? So sad, but I understand why it was done.\n\nAlso, Han got a lot of screen time in that movie and Harrison Ford absolutely killed it...  That's going out on a high note.\n\nI don't know what to feel right now:", "I guess Chewie is flying Solo now", "Holy shit these comments are negative. It's like /r/movies is trying to prove a point that they know how to make a better Star Wars film. I am so, so grateful that I enjoyed the crap out of it.", "THE STORM TROOPERS FINALLY HIT SOMETHING! THEY'RE EVOLVING!", "I saw it yesterday afternoon. For the record, I love Star Wars and have loved Star Wars since I first saw the original trilogy 30+ years ago. I own memorabilia, comic books and have even read some of the novels. I was extremely excited about this movie... probably even moreso than a lot of my family, friends and coworkers who were also excited. I'm what they call a \"fanboy\". I even brought my Yoda flashlight to the theater and risked arrest because \"No Star Wars Masks, Costumes or Paraphernalia Allowed\" were everywhere.\n\n**And, I hated this movie. Absolutely hated it.** It was completely derivative and uninspired. It was essentially a mashup of different scenes from the original trilogy. I was extremely disappointed.\n\nI honestly can't fathom why this movie has a 95% on RT and Reddit thinks it's so great. Oh, wait... I know why. Because RT and Reddit are skewed and filled with teenagers and idiot 20-somethings who get a hard on at the mere mention of Star Wars without even thinking about important things like story, directing and legacy. This movie was designed as a cash cow for Disney and to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Nothing more.\n\n1 star. And I'm being generous.\n\nEDIT: Two things. First, yes... I'm aware that there are \"GenXers\" and other older people who love Star Wars and liked this movie. But the fact remains that websites like Reddit and Rotten Tomatoes DO cater to kids and Metacritic can (and probably does) cherry pick reviews based on what's going to generate the most web traffic/money. Second, so what if critics rave about it? You're acting like critics have tenure and can't get fired or something. A critic's newspaper column is NOT a completely objective and sacrosanct space free of outside influence. Critics can and do lose their jobs. And newspaper can and do capitalize on popular culture any way they can. And if you think the papers don't demand positive reviews for tentpole movies, then you're a fool. And, as this thread clearly demonstrates, anyone who criticizes The Force Awakens might as well have called Ghandi a loser. A critic/public personality is no less susceptible to the pitchforks.\n\nI stand by my words. The movie sucked. It was a cash cow. The reviews were influenced by hype and money. And the people that were driving it were idiot kids who completely lack depth in cinema and storytelling. Oh, and lets not forget obese GenXers who needed a reason leave their houses squeezed into a Stormtrooper costume so they can cosplay looking like a white, armor-plated sausage.\n", "Just got back from seeing it, thought it was pure, unadultered garbage.  Total crapfest.  I'm sooooooo glad I kept my expectations low, otherwise I might actually be upset or disappointed, but instead it just confirms my belief of the last decade that JJ Abrams is a [big bad swear word] director who doesn't understand the first thing about storytelling.\n \nSo, let's do the run down:\n \nBB8 was cool.  No complaints there.  Though the rolling down the stairs scene did make me wonder how he was doing that.\n \nFinn was the only character I liked, which surprised me.  He actually had more than one dimension!  I felt his story doesn't make a goddamn lick of sense, but the character himself was alright.  But seriously, captured at birth, raised from infancy to be a Stormtrooper, get assigned...sanitation?  Really?  That's what the First Order does with its highly trained shocktroops, it puts them in charge of sanitation?  Yeah, okay, that totally makes sense.  ::eyeroll::   I mean, the sanitation thing did explain why all of sudden this lone Stormtrooper changes sides (it being his first battle, which I wouldn't have assumed if they hadn't said something), but still -- this is like finding out that after spending millions to train a Navy Seal they assigned him to the motor pool.  Worst. Military. Ever.\n \nRei was yet another example of why feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to action/adventure films.  Totally one dimensional Mary Sue of Perfection, no discernible flaws, encompassing the best traits of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker with none of either character's flaws.  Hated her, have zero interest in her story.  This is not a real character, this is sop to whiny internet feminists in the vain hope they won't accuse the film of sexism.  \n \nAlso, what the hell was up with the super meaningful hug between Rei and Leia at the end?  THEY HAD NEVER MET BEFORE THAT MOMENT.  It was just like...Rei is the hero, so OF COURSE Leia knows who she is instantly.  You're a [big bad swear word] writer JJ!  None of your characters ever EARN these victories.\n \nHan Solo...Harrison Ford is old and needs to retire from acting.  It felt like the only reason he was in this movie was to confirm it was a Star Wars movie and get killed by Kylo Ren.  Everything he did in this movie was powered by convenience and a need to move the plot forward.  Nothing felt earned or real.  The revelation that Kylo Ren is his son was so stupid.  Oh my god, really?  Just smacked of \"I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate.\"  FIND A NEW PLOT TWIST, JJ.  Sadly Han's death was spoiled for me by assholes on the internet, which sucked all the drama out of that scene.  It was nice that this movie actually gave Chewbacca some stuff to do, even if still wasn't much.  Though I kind of find it ludicrous to suggest that after 40+ years of adventuring together, Han never once fired Chewie's bowcaster until he was in his 70s.  \n \nThe entire sequence on the Millennium Falcon was painful to watch.  It was just one gag after another designed to remind you how much better A New Hope is that this turgid, cliche-ridden piece of crap.  Hey, look, it's Luke's training sphere!  Remember that scene?  That was so much better than THIS scene.  Oh, and there's the holographic game table.  Remember that scene?  That was so much better than THIS scene.   Callbacks are great and all, but too many of them and it just makes your movie look weak like its relying on your fondness for the originals in a desperate attempt to convince you that you like this movie too.  Sorry, Force Awakens, all you achieved was making me realize how much better A New Hope was.\n \nThe entire plot of this movie was just hammering home how much this movie rips off from A New Hope.  The droid lost on a desert world, carrying the secret plans that everyone needs, finding the young Jedi-to-be, being taken to the Rebellion Resistance (why the name change?  Why not just keep calling it the Rebel Alliance?), good guy planets are blown up for even less reason -- actually wait, I have to stop there because this was literally the stupidest plot point of the whole film.  So the Empire First Order (stupid name) builds an EVEN BIGGER death star, it's fully operational, it's clearly been around for some time (hell, the Resistance has full schematics for it...), and the First Order has been locked in a battle with the Resistance backed by the New Republic for some time.\n \nSo why the [big bad swear word] didn't they blow up the New Republic worlds the second the Starkiller was completed?  Why the hell did they wait until so late in the game to test it out?  Does this make any sense?  No, this makes no sense.\n \nOh and then we have the Greatest Pilot Of All Time,, whose name I have already forgotten, who dies a third of the way into the movie only to mysteriously be Not Dead just in time to fire his photon torpedos into a venting port only 2 meters wide.  Oh wait, no, wrong movie.  This finale rips off Return of the Jedi with the Wedge flying his X-Wing into the heart of Death Star II.\n \nSecond stupidest plot point?  The map.  I haven't been this bored by a stupid MacGuffin since Avatar and its head-slapping Unobtanium.  I'm sorry, I don't buy that [big bad swear word] for a second.  You have a star map showing a huge sector of space, but you can't identify it by comparing it to known star charts?  And what a waste of R2D2.  He's just been sitting there powered down, and then because the movie is almost over, he boots up just in time to reveal he has the rest of the map.  Again, JJ, you're a [big bad swear word] writer and none of your characters have EARNED these victories.\n \n \nPharsma?  The Silver Stormtrooper?  Total waste of a character.  Why did they even bother?  I can't believe people were saying this was going to be the new Boba Fett.\n \nOh, and Adam Driver was actually much better as Kylo Ren than I was expecting, and except for the whole \"Han Solo's son\" nonsense (which seemed shoe-horned in just to give some pathos to him killing Han, which was probably mandated by Ford's contract), I thought he was a pretty alright character.\n \nCan't say the same for the main villain though.  First of all, his name is Snoke.  What kind of halfass lame villain name is that?  How am I supposed to take that seriously?  And seriously, [big bad swear word] whoever it is in Hollywood who thinks CGI villains are anything but ridiculously lame.  So bloody stupid.\n\nFinal judgement 2 out of 5 stars as JJ Abrams destroyed yet another classic sci-fi franchise with his ham-fisted, coincidence driven plot full of holes big enough to fly a Super Star Destroyer through.  Way to [big bad swear word] all over a legacy.  I'd be more pissed if Lucas hadn't beat him to the punch with the Prequels.", "My problems with the movie:\n\nIt was a point for point ripoff of ANH\n\nWhy did Kylo Ren wear the Darth Vader style helmet he obviously didn't need?\n\nWhy was Kylo Ren's lightsaber all janky?\n\nTechnically, the First Order were now the Rebel Alliance, where did they get all the resources for ships and to build a Death Star III into a planet?\n\nWhat was the plan after the Death Star III sucked up it's sun?  Was it really just a one shot pony?  If so, where did it get the energy for it's first shot?  (Ignoring the fact that, yeah, suspension of disbelief is required for entertainment value, but the idea of sucking the mass of a star into the volume of a planet a million or so times smaller and not creating a black hole completely SHATTERS the fourth wall)\n\nWhy did Poe have to look exactly like a young Luke Skywalker?

I just caught the morning showing with my brother and I cant understand how they screwed it up. The best part of the movie is the shot in the beginning when the storm-troopers were in the carrier about to land on the planet. I was getting a Starship Troopers vibe from that part and was waiting for the \"Remember your training and you will survive\" speech from a Trooper sergeant. it never came. I have a few questions:\n\n- Why do the Stromtroopers wear that ridiculous bulky armor if it cant even deflect a pistol blast?\n- How did Kylo Ren not destroy Finn in two seconds with his lightsaber?\n- How did Rey know how to pilot the millennium falcon? \n- How was she not utterly destroyed in the first 10 seconds with a trained force user?\n- Where was the Republics ships, why did the rebels and have to fight The New Order?\n- Where was The New Orders fleet?

Yet it was like a lost friend coming home and I loved it.", "A lot of talk about Han Solo's death being unfitting for this great big character (war hero, ace pilot, etc...).

They just stared at each other for so long, felt kinda weird. Was great to see Hamill's glorious facial hair tho.\n\nEdit: and they kept cutting between their faces, made it more comical.", "I felt pretty sad watching it.  After hearing so many positive things about it and being a big fan of the original trilogy, I just felt \"meh\" about this film.\n\nI was particularly disturbed reading the initial crawl and seeing the first few scenes and realizing it was basically a re-make of ANH.  Once again, some vital information gets shoved into a droid and the droid has to get that information to the Rebellion/Resistance.\n\nThe biggest clunkers for me were:\n\n1)  The big scene between Han Solo and Leia just felt awkward.  That entire scene was just nothing but exposition repeated over and over again emphasizing that somehow Ren turned back and went away and joined the New Order.  I guess they assumed the average audience would have ADHD so they felt the need to really hammer the fact home.  That Ren turned bad.  And went away.  And joined the First Order.  That he's their son.  And then he turned bad.  And went away.  And joined the First Order.  The whole scene just fell flat, to me, with none of the emotion it should have evoked.  I'm not sure if any awesome acting on the part of Ford and/or Fisher could have saved this scene.  The lines were just clunky and unnatural.\n\n2)  I'm not sure what Leia was thinking asking Han to bring Ren home.  Talk about sending a guy to his death.  If your son has run away, slaughtered a bunch of Jedis he was training with and then was complicit in the destruction of 5-6 planets, I think it's asking a bit much for a little father-and-son talk to suddenly make him see the light.\n\n3)  It was a bit of a let-down finding out the main badguy is a kid barely old enough to get a drink in a cantina who has Mommy & Daddy issues.\n\n4)  Luke must have been a really terrible Jedi instructor if Kylo Ren had a hard time fighting two people WITH NO TRAINING in a light-saber duel.  If anything, he should have been toying with them, cutting them apart bit by bit, basically torturing them and maybe being defeated by his arrogance.  Instead, he's fighting for his life.\n\n5)  The whole \"Jedi turned bad\" is kinda stale.  Plus, it begs the question as to why bother training Jedi if there seems to be such a high risk of them turning rogue and getting genocidal.  Unless, of course, the Obi-Won-Kenobi/Skywalker lineage are just horrible instructors when it comes to keeping their students from going all Dark-Sidey and wanting to blow up entire planets.\n\n6)  My biggest gripe about Return of the Jedi, the worst of the original trilogy, is that once again, the Empire chooses to make a copy of a previous weapon system that failed...the only difference being that it's larger.  And the New Order does it again.  It's like the Empire and the New Order have no imagination.

The duel at the end was all I wanted and more. \n\nAnd I totally think that Rey is Luke's daughter. ", "Man, am I glad for this thread, I've been going nuts for someone to talk to about this thing.\n\nI'll be upfront and say I didn't enjoy the film. The pacing, tone, characterization, story, was anemic. No element was given proper attention and we ended up with a patchwork fishing net of possibility and winks to the audience. Too derivative (to an insulting level,) and wayyyyy too much fanservice. I get it, it's been a while, we're excited, but how are we supposed to appreciate a new world when all we talk about is the old? And stop telling me to like BB, film. When did they start installing \"adorable yukster\" as a droid oS? Anyway, here's stuff on the top of my brain.\n\nThe pace was insane. This was the first thing I noticed. The film rushed us through at a breakneck speed that never truly let up. It's mash scene scene scene with no breathing room whatsoever. No room to relax, to build tension, to experience. Just boom boom boom. Compare the opening of Force Awakens to its spirit animal New Hope: Both start with a clash between rebels and empire (despite vague name changes,) both employ stormtroopers and rebel soldiers, both have preparations before the fight. In FA we see both sides before truly know whats happening, the rebels are surprised, get into position, the ships slam down, war breaks out. In NH, we get a long view of both ships, then a long cut of the empire blow-torching the doors open and reactions from the rebels. This is probably the easiest direct parallel of this change in pacing and tone. A true \"Saving Private Ryan\" D-Day scene could have been employed to build tension in that example. There are a few others, the \"sitting in the sand looking at nothing scenes\" are good as well, but even there we have a music swell and focus on our hero, vs. a show of our great set piece and cut to the next thing. The one place it maintained was the text crawl intro, which felt insanely out of place to the picture as a whole. The shift is one of a classic-inspired \"space opera\" to a fairly straight-forward \"by the numbers\" action film. This is fine, frankly it's probably what we want (or think we want) as a whole, but I feel like this loss of breathing room in places, to allow us to experience the film, is where we will lose the long-run permanency of this film vs. the old. Yet, despite all this bombast, I found myself shocked at how bored I was in the theater as JJ threw everything and the kitchen sink at me as quickly as he could. Taking some time to engage in the characters would have helped.\n\nFirstly: Who is our main character? If you said \"Rey,\" you're probably right. Probably. To be honest, I'm not even sure as I sit here, we're never given enough time with anyone to know, but given her big push in the third act, she's most likely who we're supposed to truly invest in. Yet, we're never truly given any time with her. She's a scavenger, like a bunch of people, wants to stay on Jakku because.... reasons and is benevolent to BB because.... well, she's supposed to. She saves him from a net from another scavenger (who doesn't care that she's making off with his catch? what?) then doesn't trade him for food because.... ? Well, even she never really says. It's probably because she's supposed to. Pretty much everything she does is based on what we, the audience, expect her to do. She is fairly static the whole flick, not really having any opinions or ideas of her own, outside of \"I need to go home\" because \"waiting.\" Even her sudden cognizant Jedi flip at the end was because it's what we expect of her. I would have liked more set-up for it (more foreshadowing for it, there was some, and I likely missed more,) and at least some explanation to why she chills out. No one (from my recollection) told her to be calm to be awesome, it's just a visual cue for us, the audience, to know what to expect. Rey shouldn't know that at all.\nFinn is more problematic, as they attempted to throw a nice stormtrooper curve-ball our way but abandoned any thought fairly instantaneously. Finn is introduced as a stormtrooper with a conscience, programmed to kill but doesn't think it's right. Finn sets free a prisoner in order to get away, and instantly starts blowing away (formerly fellow) stormtroopers without a second thought. Finn literally goes from being horrified at war with bloody fingers across his helmet to blowing away his former comrades within a few scenes, and never brings it up or talks about it. It's not just when it's civillians, Finn's against shooting the other soldiers, too, so what's the deal there? It was a fascinating concept that was dropped almost as fast as it was introduced. \nPoe was almost entirely useless to keep around, and was much more interesting as another death on Finn's hands than as a character in his own right. Poe should have either been left out, left dead, or more interestingly, combined with Finn. Make Finn either undercover and having to deal with betraying the people he's been undercover with, or at least a pilot to give him something to do in the third act.\nAnother struggle with all these characters is how incredibly bland everyone was. No one had any destinct characteristics, everyone was a quip-spouting reference-dropping hero. The quips. God's sake the jokey quips. Not only was everyone cracking wise, but everyone was the \"cool we'll figure it out\" person. Finn may have been jittery at it, but he still was the \"fly by the seat of my pants\" guy like everyone else, crowding out Solo from his own deal. If everyone's Han Solo, then even Han Solo is no longer Han Solo. It made for ridiculous, Fast and the Furious-style dialogue, further obsfucating any opportunity to develop character.\nI liked a lot of Kylo (read below,) but he had no true motivation that I could see. Kylo just seems to want to be evil for evil's sake. Does he believe in this new empire? Why? Why not? Anyone to go to such great lengths should have a fairly strong reason and belief behind it. There was a thin Darth Vader reference, but what was that, truly? Kylo's fight was weird. I would have liked both Finn and Rey at him at the same time to overwhelm him, then Finn going down being Rey's inspiration.\n\nIt was also hard to contextualize characters and all when so little context was given. We were set-up a basic \"rebels vs. empire.... only not\" idea, and left to twist from there. Nothing mattered to anything. What, really, was the empire, or whatever's, goal? What were those planets that got wiped out? Who knows, no one seems to care (I was surprised it wasn't an early flip for Rey to hear the voices of billions snuffed out.)  Even the control room seemed fairly \"whatever\" about the affair. At least Leia cared and Obi-Wan noticed, and it was a planet important to the plot in the first place (to stumble upon the empire for rational plot-written reasons, not absurd coincidence after absurd coincidence.) Did anyone care that therebels basically blew up a planet, too? Seriously, did anything actually matter? Ah, well.\nAlso, don't come at me with \"they'll say it in the next movie,\" that's ridiculous. A film should not be made exclusively to set-up a second, third, etc. movie. A film can tell a complete story while leaving room for further stories. On that logic they created a two-and-a-half hour prologue. That's gross.\n\nIn a matter of fairness, however, there were some things I enjoyed. Primarily in conceptual ideas:\nKylo wasn't amazing, but he was probably the most developed character (which isn't saying a lot.) The concept of an essentially light side Jedi trying to force himself to be dark/evil/etc. was an interesting flip.\n\nI loved that the empire, silly renaming aside (which felt like when the DC universe wants to use Nazis but not swastikas,) was truly militaristic this time. Stormtroopers wrecked house. Airstrikes were called in. Counter-lightsaber measures were in place. Military minutia existed (the \"taking your helmet off without permission\" thing was great.) It made them seem competent and interesting. I think there were more small things with them than anything else in the film.\n\nThat's most of it, really. There may be more, but I don't remember it off the top of my head.\n\nIn the long and short of it, a pseudo-tl;dr would be thus:\nThey didn't make a new Star Wars film. They made an action set-up for the next Star Wars film.\n\nOk, that's off my chest. If you legit made it this far, thanks for helping my spirit rest.", "Am I the only one who thinks TFA is the worst star wars made, even worse than the prequels?\n\nAs much as I wasn't too fond of TPM and AOTC (I think Revenge Of the Sith was done well), at least there was original worlds and cool new characters in these movies.\n\nTFA just felt patronising to watch especially as a fan of the originals, loved the nostalgia moments in the film but apart from that, what was the point of the film?\nJJ Abrams said it was to introduce star wars to a 'new generation', I don't buy that, best way to introduce them would be to give them a copy of A New Hope. This isn't set on one street, or one country, or hell even one planet. This is set in a whole Galaxy, where the possibilities are endless and the best they could come up with is a carbon copy of the first, the whole film just stinks of lazy writing, how JJ Abrams got another Job after Lost I don't know", "Saw it with friends, none of us liked it. My greatest gripe of this movie was that there was absolutely no subtlety. Not only did the overuse of comedy feel out of place, it was shoved down the audience's throat so hard that it was impossible to ignore. The same applies for the reveal of Kylo as Han's son. How many times did Han and Leia say OUR SON in a row? I get that a new cast and story will require some exposition, but I wish it was done in a semi tactful way.\n\nThis entire movie lacked soul. It felt like the product of endless focus groups, trying it's best to please everyone.  Clearly this business model was successful, because Reddit seems to be eating it up. \n\nAs a final note, was anyone else extremely confused as to the point of Maz's character? I don't get how people can be upset at the prequels' overuse of CGI but be fine with this completely useless and boring character taking up screen time. \n\nEDIT: Expected the downvotes, but I would prefer to have some more discussion.", "To be completely honest, This movie was not good. Not bad as in a piece of garbage movie but bad as in just not good enough. I felt like the actors were good but the plot points were poor.\n\nSpoilers ahead: \n\nThe first 10 minutes had me hooked. Jakku, a scavenger, the new villain etc. Then came the plot problems. They introduce us with a storm trooper who is questioning his orders and as a result decides to go free the prisoner pilot whom he's never had contact with. He goes in and out (the room) WITHOUT any trouble. Now let's go to when Rey and Finn are running on Jakku. You mean to tell me the tie-fighters are going to shoot a ship full of scrap than shoot at the Millennium Falcon? Why didn't the guys who come in to kill Han Solo just steal the Millennium Falcon? Why did Fin volunteer to save everyone and assume they would find a way to lower the shields? Also, why did Rey suddenly learn Jedi mind tricks? There's a lot more plot problems but those are my first thoughts.", "That moment when Han and Kylo Ren was awesome. The sun is still out and Kylo is standing half in the light, half in the dark (technically illuminated by the glow of his lightsaber). Then he slows hands the saber to Han, then the sun goes out and Kylo is completely in the dark. Stabs him. Beautiful. \n\nI was watching so closely for anything specifically like this because I love cheezy shit like that, and I couldn't ask for anything better.", "I know I'm late to the game, so if anyone reads this I'll be happy about it.\n\n\nI love Star Wars, especially the original trilogy, but even the prequels were fun growing up.\n\nBecause of this, it's really hard to appreciate episode VII as its own movie, without comparing it to the other episodes, but standalone I'd give it a tentative 5 out of 10. I don't think it was a bad movie, but I don't think it was good.\n\nThe dialogue is weak all over; lots of clich\u00e9s in everything anyone says. From Finn's \"You don't know me! You don't know my past!\" to that joke that soooo many movies use where a character says something reassuring, then reveals he was talking to himself, the movie was riddled with it. I know those are just two Finn lines but I've only seen the movie once and can't remember many exact lines, but I had to stop myself from rolling my eyes a lot.\n\nThe CGI was also unnecessary and not very good in a lot of parts. I'm not one of those people who hates CGI right off the bat, but currently I don't think CGI is realistic enough to use without it looking too fake for some things, and characters like Maz and Snoke had no business being entirely animated. It looked unnatural in the theater, and ten years from now it will not have aged well, unlike the costumes from the original trilogy.\n\nThe movie also had zero subtlety. [Spoilers](#s \"when the antagonist is going to kill Han, the movie basically reveals it in advance. The music effectively says 'wait for it' and the words he uses are overtly mysterious, to the point where no part of you doubts he is about to kill Han with the weapon he is holding out\")\n\nThe big thing for me though was the main character. Rey was flawless for some reason; she wasn't whiny or hotheaded or cowardly or stubborn or stupid weak or anything, and it made it almost impossible for me to think anything bad would happen to her. I've noticed this in a lot of movies, especially with superheroes. The characters are just so naturally strong and stoic and perfect that even when they've \"met their match\" I'm never scared whatsoever, because I know they'll be fine. Actually, from the moment she removes her mask at the beginning and that gentle music plays, I knew she would be a strong and compassionate fighter for good, with little to no flaws, and was not surprised in the slightest as the movie went on. Again, more of the predictability I talked about above.\n\nBecause of all this, the movie is a ham-handed, single-layered action movie with poor dialogue and unpleasant special effects used for flashiness rather than aesthetics. There were cool parts, but everything about it is predictable and has been done over and over again, thusly making it not a particularly notable movie as a standalone.\n\nAs a Star Wars movie, however, I can't even count it. I can barely count it as a misinformed fanfiction. This is what bothered me the most:\n\nThe movie completely misuses the force. The force is based on the Tao, and is the connection between and essence of everything. Only with an understanding of that connection can someone tap into the force and use it. A bit of it leaks out before training with Annie in episode 1, but it makes sense that a young boy could notice that connection enough to be able to do some minor manipulations without quite understanding more about the connection. The concept was completely ruined in this movie; [Spoiler](#s \"With no prompting from any Jedi masters, and literally no grasp of the force or her connection to the world, Rey can already control minds, is a master with a lightsaber, and has a stronger force pull than the antagonist who trained for who knows how long.\") This just isn't how the force works, fundamentally. Han even says at some point that that's not how the force works. I really think this kills all the ties with mindfulness and connection to the universe, and dumbs the force down to nothing more than whatever it was Matilda could do.\n\nThe movie also had no business including the old characters as much as it did. Their story was supposed to end when it did, and this movie should have moved on. Instead it feels like a bad fanfiction; [Spoiler](#s \"the writers divorce Han and Leia, do god knows what with Luke, and send Han back to smuggling before he is murdered. Watch the original trilogy again and tell me that after it ends, the entirety of the trilogy should have been in vain with the sith rising again immediately after, and Han dying an outlaw divorcee who never actually learned anything after all.\")\n\nIt's hard to call this the main problem because there were so many, but something that was just fundamentally awful was how painfully close it stuck to the original trilogy. Nothing substantial was new. The main character comes from a desert planet, finds a Droid with crucial info, and helps [spoiler](#s \"blow up the death star\"). There's no new enemy; the sith are just back. The movie goes exactly as expected. They stuck so close to the originals, assumingly fearing backlash, that they failed to make anything great and unique.\n\n\nOverall, I think the movie is basically just a dumbed down remake of the originals, copying the same story and premise and characters, while ignoring any old subtleties or hidden meanings. I also think that many people who appreciate the original trilogy for being more than just a few shallow Sci fi action movies will have a hard time considering episode VII canon, as it undoes a lot of what the first 6 movies did just for the sake of doing it again. I, at least for now, am not really going to consider it an official continuation even though Disney and JJ say it is, because it honestly just doesn't make sense in the star wars universe, especially since George Lucas seems to agree", "I'll be honest on first viewing this is the worst of all the Star Wars movies for me.\n\nThe new characters were pretty good but the plot and pacing is rage inducing\n\nI can understand Kylo jobbing in the fight but someone explain to me how the Falcon and probably somewhere around two to three dozen X Wings took down a planet sized battle stations defenses. In the original films it took entire resistance fleets to distract the Death Stars defense forces to score kills. The scale of this film feels far smaller than even the battle of naboo which is criminal given that there is a literal multi planet buster weapon which killed billions present. Why was the new republic not giving any aid to the resistance to counter the FiRst order after they committed genocide ", "Unpopular Opinion: This was probably the weakest Star Wars film so far. (Yes that includes the prequels)\n\nI say that because this film was so insistently unoriginal that if you were a fan in any way you have seen this movie before. Even the big \"twist\" felt like \"oh been here done that.\" The plot the characters the character arcs, are all just mashed up versions of what came before. \n\nWhen I engage with any Star Wars content I expect it to be something I have never seen before. More importantly I expect it to have something to say. (Like it or not even the prequels had something to say.) This move was void of any original voice or experiences. Just a mash up of plot and characters from the original trilogy.\n\nI highly doubt I will be purchasing a Star Wars movie ticket for a long long time.

His mission is to save millions of lives and to do that he has to sacrifice hundreds along the way.\n* When Rey said, \"You're afraid you're not as strong as Darth Vader.\" This could make sense because at one point he will have to kill his master and leave the dark side.\n* The scene with his Dad: Earlier in the movie it was said facing his dad would be a test. He had to kill him because that was the only way Snoke would ever truly trust him and believe he was on the dark side.\n* After that moment R2D2 \"wakes up\" and conveniently sets in motion the next part of the plan.\n* Maybe Han realized this and plunged the saber into himself. He died a noble death and sacrificed himself for the greater good.\n* I really want to watch the movie again and see if I can kill or help confirm this theory but maybe someone out there can help me out?

It would be like us losing track of Utah...\n", "Disney: Harrison Ford is expensive. Kill him first. ", "I had quite a few problems with this movie, mostly with the writing. \n\nWhy does Kylo Ren get less competent as the movie goes on? At the beginning, he's the strongest force-user we've seen on screen. By the end, he struggles against some guy and an un-trained Force sensitive.\n\nHow is Rey so powerful immediately? And how does she even know the mind trick is a thing? Earlier in the movie, she didn't even know the Jedi were real, and now she's using their advanced techniques?\n\nWhy does R2 wake up when he does? Why doesn't BB-8 recognize him? He clearly knows C-3PO, so what's the use of the exposition, other than the fact that the audience needs it?\n\nWhy is the First Order bad? What's their motivation? Why doesn't the Republic do anything about it? Is it so that the main characters can be the \"underdogs\" again?\n\nWhy is Captain Phasma a character? To sell toys?\n\nWhere did Maz get Luke's old lightsaber, which should be somewhere on Bespin?\n\nIf the First Order has the entire map but one piece, why can't they just go there and destroy the planets in that system? Or simply remove the sun with their weapon, killing every living thing in that system?\n\nI thought the last shot of the movie was really dumb.\n\nOverall, it was a fun movie, but there were some glaring issues (that could be forgiven, or explained in the next movie.) My biggest problem is that, for me at least, it either *didn't* feel like a Star Wars movie, or it was a rehash of the original movie.

The life of the Kray's is incredibly dense and he (Helgeland) attempted to capture many (if not all) of their interpersonal relationships, at the expense of producing a consistent tone. One minute you've got a scene powered by dramatic comedy between Ronnie and Reggie, and the next you're saddled with the tragic love story between Francis and Reggie. The movie jumped around between all these different emotional resonances from scene to scene and didn't give itself enough time to breath. A particularly glaring example is the scene where Reggie walks in to find Francis dead. He is slumped in the chair beside her bed with the somber piano playing in the background and in one cut, you're in the boisterous casino trying to catch up on Ronnie's side of things. I'm not asking to drag every emotional high out for an eternity, but give it enough time to sink in.\n\nIn a manner of speaking, it suffered in the same way **Black Mass** (2015) did.

Perhaps it was because the story is not particularly well known (at least in the US), but Helgeland did not really compound the weight of their successive actions to build toward a climax. The whole story just sort of trailed off.\n\nAlthough I understand the choice to use Browning as the voice-over/narrator for the movie, that inherently placed her relationship with Reggie as centrepiece in the story, as opposed to the relationship between him and Ronnie. Although his marriage was part (if not most) of the driving force that led Reggie to his final downfall, I think too much stress was placed on that relationship; As a result, the real meat of the story was forced to take a back seat. We weren't given a chaotic relationship between two criminal brothers so much as we were given a tortured love story, *featuring* a fraternal bond story.\n\nAnother criticism I found was likely the fault of both Helgeland and Dick Pope (cinematographer). There was very little consistency to his shots. It was an awkward shit mix of long tracking shots through clubs to erratic cuts during fight scenes, to extended un-panning takes of rooms and it just didn't blend together nicely to produce a single omnipresence. Each of these styles serves it's purpose well within the context of it's own scene (some more so than others) but didn't cut together to build a well-structured whole. It's almost as if they put a different guy behind the camera each scene. \n\nIn terms of acting, Tom Hardy did an amazing job of playing two actors. I never felt I was watching Tom Hardy (certainly not during his scenes as Reggie) and he found an incredibly balance polarization between the two very different characters. Emily Browning's disposition was too flat for my taste but still pulled her weight enough for me to not resent her presence. Perhaps a little too much glaringly shallow \"wisdom\" in the narration following her death.  \n\nThey did a very good job of capturing that ethereal 60's European feel, without it feeling over-stylized (here's looking at you Gangster Squad). The club scenes were an absolute feast for the senses.\n\n**TL;DR** There is a lot of wonderful individual elements to this movie. Some incredible scenes, camera work and great acting to immerse yourself in. However the sum of it's parts did not produce a cohesive whole. \n\n**3/5**, I still do recommend. \n\n", "I will start off by saying I enjoyed the film. \n\nTom Hardy's performance was great. The action sequences were hard hitting and gritty. \n\nI also enjoyed the soundtrack greatly. A great use of music from the time and using multiple versions of the same song and not using the famous version of the track (Marvin & Tammi instead of Nancy & Frank for 'Something Stupid') Love the use of instrumental rock tunes like Sleepwalk & Green Onions. That said I actually found that the score was weak and out of place. I feel that the score would be best used for a police drama more than a gangster flick.\n\nAs I have seen written in the comments, I also felt the plot writing was weak as it felt like they were trying to string a loose plot together with some scenes. I also felt they were trying to make a Goodfellas style film but the problem was that the execution was weak.\n\nI didn't like the Emily Browning narration, it would have been interesting to have Tom Hardy narrate and switch from Reggie to Ronnie depending on the scene.\n\nSo final words on this is that it was style over substance caused by a weak plot.\n\nA question to people who have seen both, which is better Legend or The Krays?\n\nAlso is The Krays worth watching?", "I definitely agree with most of your responses that the film's plot was scattered and almost felt like a poor TV special documentary\n\nThat being said, I honestly thought there were two people playing the Crays.... like I knew it was Hardy, but damn he is good. I hope people remember this movie for his acting and not the overall plot flop", "I am honestly disappointed in this movie. First, I want to mention that considering Emily Browning's track record, I'm always skeptical on whatever movie she's been in and I was skeptical with Legend because of her (She has been in Pompeii, The Host, Sucker Punch and The Uninvited)\n\nNow here are my thoughts: I couldn't even understand some of the stuff that Tom hardy was saying since he mumbles in his films and he couldn't even save this movie. It had bad pacing issues and it really didn't seem like a biopic of the Kray twins as the marketing made it seem to be. Why did the film shift to Emily Browning's character's point of view? And why it was focusing on her about halfway through the film? There was really no need for her to say all this philosophy/expositional bullshit while she was narrating from the grave. Whether it was relevant or not, I didn't think it was necessary nor would we care and on top of that, her acting was cringy. \n\nThe only thing I can praise about this movie was the action scenes, the humour, Taron Egerton and Paul Bettany who had a very minor role.\n\nThis really didn't seem like a biopic and the way it ended seemed rush. I felt like this project could have been handled better with a different director. I know I'm sounding a bit harsh but I was just really disappointed with this movie\n\n5/10", "Scattered plot but damn good flick. ", "I have seen this movie and I have to say Tom Hardy did a good job in portraying two different people in a same movie. Emily Browning look lovely in this movie. Taron Egerton was okay as Ronnie's entourage.  \n\nI just think this movie will be better if someone else like Scorsese directed this movie. I also think that the narrative was not really engaging and I got bored for like 5-8 minutes in the middle of the movie.", "I really wanted to like this movie.  I couldn't wait for it to finally be released.  What a letdown.  I almost left before it was over.  In a gangster movie it is often useful to show what makes them actual gangsters.  Black Mass had the same issue, it showed someone being an asshole psycho, but only casual mention of 'oh, then they were the untouchable crime lords.'\n\n\nShow the crime, make it exciting.

Hemsworth does give a good performance though. This is the kind of role Kirk Douglas would've taken back in his heyday.

He does it with humor, music, debate and love. It's a musical - it can't cross over into realism much more than it does - it exists to promote the message, not the reality. Visually, it's the strongest he's ever been.

He just seemed too Louis CK and not enough radical communist screenwriter from the Red Scare days, and that hurt a lot of the impact he could have had. Otherwise there were good parts and bad parts. The middle dragged for a bit with the prison business and the whole hack screenwriting plot. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was an odd part since he was so brief and uncharacterized, and being second billed in the credits seemed strange.

Speaking of that, it didn't really elaborate on how Trumbo decided to write The Brave One, give it to the hacks at King, and then how it became so successful at the Oscars.

If you look at the beginning and the shot of a Christmas Carol, it is pretty clear that the intention of the movie is to fit that narrative and theme. Its not a horror movie first, its a tough love Christmas movie with horror elements. Looking at the director's previous work, such as the great Trick r Treat, the message is to honor the spirit of the holidays. A dark ending doesn't necessarily mean a better one, and would have run counter to the message of the movie. The family grew closer together and discovered newfound love through each other through the experiences of that night, and unlike his grandmother Max found hope and was willing to sacrafice for his family. Why would Krampus punish him for that as it goes against the entity's nature (he's not a slasher movie monster). Him watching the family through a snowglobe and leaving them the bell, is a reminder that he'll be watching them if they follow those lessons in the future (a dark version of the naughty or nice list).

It's not something I've mentioned much here, but I'm a real sucker for 80s B-movie horror films like Gremlins or The Evil Dead, and this movie is basically one long love letter to those movies. The practical effects are insane, and are used to create some of the most horrifying creatures I've seen in a long time. It's the sort of stuff that'll haunt my nightmares, especially the Jack in the Box minion. The scene in the attic was delightfully scary and basically what I hoped I'd get out of this whole thing. Krampus himself is rarely seen, the few glimpses we do catch of it show an excellent designed with a great mix of practical effects and CGI for the movement scenes (His introduction alone was surprisingly chilling). The movie itself is incredibly reminiscent of the early Tim Burton or Sam Raimi films. \n\nThe cast is excellent with Adam Scott being as charming as ever, and Allison Tolman being another highlight. The kids aren't terrible but nothing spectacular, and they manage to just about hold their own in their big scenes near the end of the movie. The humour itself falls kinda flat and it was enough to put a smile on my face at certain points, which is more or less what I was expecting. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if I'm going to be in the minority with my love for this film. There's a number of problems (Mainly the ending and the odd decisions some of the characters make throughout the film) that I'm happy to overlook, although the general reaction on places like Reddit is that the ending kinda ruins the movie. I can see where they're coming from, and I definitely saw the ending coming a mile away, but I wasn't bothered by it at all. It added to the charm for me, if anything.\n\nI'd probably give it a 9/10.

Then it would have been up there with some of the classics. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I really wanted to see Clause vs Krampus, with Clause also being a big brute of a being so that the fight was slow and destructive with the kid trying not to get destroyed by the two fighting around him. \n\nI just wanted more of Krampus in action, the final confrontation was underwhelming, and the ending didn't really do it for me.\n\nEverything just went south for me once Adam Scott got sucked away along with everyone else in the span of 15 seconds.

I had a lot of fun the whole way through. I think it had a solid blend of the horror elements and the comedy.

There were a lot of lines in the film that had me and several other people in the theater cracking up (my personal favorite: \"Jesus was born in a barn\")\n\nIt's tone is similar to Trick r' Treat, Gremlins, and a little bit of Child's Play in my opinion.\n\nI loved the practical effects on the creatures, and the CGI on Krampus and the Gingerbread men was very top notch and believable. \n\nMy biggest issue with the movie was the lack of gore. I gave this movie a 7/10 but if it would have been on the level of something like Trick r' Treat in terms of it's deaths it would have been pushed up to an 8/10 easily. I was kinda bugged by 3 of the deaths occurring from the unseen snow burrowing creature, considering there were several other ways they could have had those characters go out. \n\n\nI've noticed a lot of people had an issue with the ending, but it didn't really bug me, I can't think of a better way to end it and it fits into the Christmas mythos. \n\n\nI would recommend this film to people that are on the fence about it, the film doesn't really do anything terribly bad.

P.S. I really liked the movie.", "In my opinion, I feel that the movie should have ended differently. I think it would have been much better, and left room for a continuation, if Omi disappeared. Just hear me out on this, we never saw what happened to her when she encountered Krampus. What if he took her permanently, he had given her the bell as a reminder of what happened as said in the movie, and she failed to prevent it from happening to her family again, so it could be assumed that it was her fault and Krampus took her as he did with her family, for good. With this in mind, Max was given the bell next after witnessing his family murdered, this time as a more hands on test, he wasn't just left with the aftermath like his grandmother, but lived through all of it, Krampus was testing him to see if he could do what she did not. Max confronted Krampus at the sleigh, where he offered himself for the return of his family. Krampus wiped away the tear, and proceeded to laugh, Picking up Max, and before dropping him, gives time for one more request, which would be, \"I just want Christmas to go back to how it was blah, blah, blah...\" and then he is dropped into the fire. \n\nWhile all of this happened in the film, I threw in my way of comprehending it all so that I could get to my wanted ending, which would be that max would wake up Christmas morning. he would go down stairs to see his family waiting, and all the dialogue would roll on as did in the movie, yet Omi would be missing, but Max would be distracted from the fact due to no one else seeming to pay it any mind. They would proceed to open presents, and Max and the family would get what they want, and after all was done would disperse out of the room to carry out the rest of their days, all except Max. This is because Max would come to find a sole, lonely box, pushed deep into the corner next to the tree and fireplace, a box composed of dark, damp cardboard, and wrapped with a maroon ribbon, one that seemed all to familiar, all to... dreamlike. max would open the box to reveal a charcoal stained, steel bell, enscribed \"Krampus\".\n\nOnly Max will carry the burden of the memories should they ever bee needed again, for that's what Omi did, as when Krampus comes again, he will claim Max, and dawn a new bell. Every family has one, and every family will lose hope, but that's why Krampus exists, and that's why we're all watched.

It was entertaining and made me laugh. \nIt wasn't scary, just entertaining and fun. I'll end up adding this to my Christmas collection. It was a breath of fresh air for during the Christmas season. ", "Krampus was a pretty tight Christmas horror movie. \n\nWhen Krampus house jumps after the sister, I was on the damn edge. \n\n\"Eat shit kid, you're getting snow globed.\"", "The first act of the film felt like a John Hughes movie (i.e. the dysfunctional families reminded me a lot of the family from the Home Alone movies). I actually kind of hoped that some of them would die (or whatever) at a certain point. The film then turned pretty dark pretty quickly and it humanized the characters making me care about them after hating them. I actually felt bad and didn't want them to die. By that point it was too late for them. I thought that was effective in the way the characters were handled. Creature effects were fun and sometimes campy (in a good way) and a few left lingering disturbed impressions (Jack-in-the-box, anyone?). I especially loved the way Krampus and the design of his sleigh.\n\nI expected the ending somewhat, but it had a good twist that was somewhat ambiguous as to the fate of the family, which was also kind of neat (IMO). It had some solid suspense scenes, but not a lot of gore (PG-13 rating). One memorable scene in particular undercut the suspense with the comedic incredulousness of what was happening (during which Adam Scott kept yelling \"are you kidding me\"). Everyone gave great performances, and even the kids were great, which is something considering kids are usually annoying in movies (and when they are \"annoying\" in this film it's deliberate). It also have very nicely framed shots and a very interesting tone. If you've seen Trick 'r Treat you're somewhat familiar with the director's style already.\n\nFinally, I would say this film is very much in line with the idea behind the director's previous film, Trick 'r Treat in it's general theme. The idea is that there is a general spirit related and associated with a holiday that's kept in tradition. When people break that tradition and spirit, they're punished. In Trick 'r Treat, it's about keeping the \"old rules\" and \"old ways\" to appease ancient demons of Halloween. In Krampus it's about keeping in mind the spirit that comes along with Christmas, the spirit of love, joy, and sacrifice. When you exemplify that spirit, you're rewarded by Santa Clause. When you kill that spirit or let it die in your heart, you're punished by Krampus and his evil minions. The deeper meaning in this film was about family, and the idea of unconditional love towards people we can generally not get along with. These people are at each other's throats in the first act, but by they end of the film they are protecting and fighting for each other.\n\nThe visual effects were very enjoyable, a few of them were very CGI (the gingerbread minions stood out) but then they came of as cartoony evil gremlin-like creatures which generally fit what the film was going for. Most everything else felt real or practical. Even when Krampus was leaping rooftop to rooftop, it didn't feel CGI to me, he had a real weight to him and the environment shook and reacted to his presence. All the other evil minions looked especially creepy and dark, and I enjoyed the evil teddy bear as it attack a character they hit it back and made a squeaky noise every time they struck it. This was definitely a cut above the usual scary movies, and although this film wasn't a slasher, it was a fun horror movie that was sometimes in the vein of Gremlins, sometimes in the vein of a John Hughes family movie gone deadly. I would definitely give it an 8/10. ", "One thing I noticed about this movie was that for the majority of it, Max takes a back seat and huddles with Grandma. Not only does he not make many choices during the film, he doesn't even witness most of the events.\n\nNormally that would bug me, but this movie was so entertaining I didn't give a shit. This was a fun adventure.", "My hypothesis:\n\nEverything that happened to the family was real. Krampus and his helpers killed them all. The boy really did die in the firepit.

I had loads of fun. I like to think that the globes are just his way of checking up on them tho", "Liked the movie quite a bit.\n\nBut did anybody else catch the Calvin & Hobbes reference when they bring up \"the noodle incident\"?

I experienced both joy/laughter and horror at the exact same time, which I can't really say I have done too much except maybe at points during *The Vist*, however even then I would say my bouts of laughter and horror alternated.  While watching *Krampus* I genuinely experienced laughter and horror simultaneously which was interesting.  I thought that was rather effective.\n\nI am still mulling over the ending.  The optimist in me hopes that the family was brought back to life and put back on earth with the bell to serve as a reminder to the family of the lesson they learned and Krampus' snow globe being the way he watches over them to make sure they maintain the Christmas spirit, however I can also see that they may be trapped in some sort of hell or purgatory now.  I can appreciate that sometimes people want endings open for interpretation but I would rather not have to think over it, I want to know!", "It wasn't awful, nor was it really that good.

I hope I don't get downvoted for this (already have twice on here because I said I wasn't a fan of it). \n\nRegardless, I thought it was just meh. The practical effects were cool and the kid actors weren't bad. But after what I thought was an interesting start and premise (pointing out the ironic differences between what the holidays are \"about\" and what they are in reality, as well as the horrible visiting family) kind of lost its steam once Krampus actually arrived.\n\nI didn't think any of the characters were likable, save for the main kid and the mom. I get that some of them were supposed to be annoying, but there's a limit, for me at least, to how far that charm will get you. \n\nThere wasn't much of a plot or plan on the behalf of the family. Things just sort of happened again and again until it ended. \n\nIt wasn't that funny, and it wasn't that scary.

Not a bad movie by any stretch, but one that I did not very much enjoy, personally. I probably would have loved it had they gone the hard rated R route with more gore and horror violence, but I cans see why they didnt go that route and thats okay. Very Good Kid's Movie, Not my cup of shit. ", "ITT: Reddit explores its identity", "Krampus.\n\nThe effects were fantastic. The horror was surprisingly good. The pacing of the movie, at least for the first half, ie, the suspense, was well executed. But in my opinion, that's where the good stopped.  I found the switches between humor and horror to be jarring. Proper comedic timing is paramount for a horror-comedy, and I feel like the director wanted to do both without making a full decision. It didn't work well. The switches left the humor underwhelming while the horror felt out of place. As far as the writing, as a whole, was both played out and predictable. Characters were mostly \"oh this guy\" and \"mother in law\". The acted exactly like you'd expect, and that predictable transparency came through in the plot as well.\n \nThis is a minor complaint, but the subtitles for the grandmother were completely sporadic. Half of her Austrian lines were ubsubbed, forcing the audience to wait for a translation from another character. Sometimes this is done for suspense, but when she, excluding a single line from Adam Scott, is the ONLY character who speaks Austrian, it feels bizarre that others understand it. If you're going to leave them unsubbed, do it with everything. Why should I understand mundane details, and not plot specific ones. ESPECIALLY when she speaks English later in the movie.\n \nI also had a problem with morality in this movie. The random killings of characters just seemed arbitrary to me. Unjust. I realize that's the backstory and lore of Krampus, but it didn't sit right with me. There were characters who didn't do anything morally wrong, and they're murdered off screen. I realize after the ending, [SPOILERS] that none of this matters, but the point stands. The ends didn't justify the means. Especially considering the fake Super Mario Bros 2 ending.\n\nTL;DR The movie was bad. Not bad enough to make fun of, but not a good film. There wasn't a single person in my group who enjoyed it.\n\nIt's better than Pixels/10", "Afterthoughts:\n\nThe movie kinda sucked. Not an enraging level of suck, but just an underwhelming level of suck.\n\nThe underwhelming comes from a whole lot of things. The script lacks high points.  It's messed up on numerous levels: suspense completely fails at every turn to come into effect, realism is gone as soon as the helper monsters arrive and where people should be losing their minds they all sleep soundly and shit like that. There's also no real plot to speak of for the characters. Why put all that family issues stuff in Max's note in the beginning as a plot device, and it's literally never followed up for free character development? I did like the ending but let's face it it was a desperate attempt to get our endorphins moving again with a surprise after the horror and comedy falls flat most of the film. And it works, I liked the little surprise at the end, as well as getting a peak at Krampus' whole crew partying down, but still... if I'm being honest I could have dozed off during the middle of the movie if the theater was warmer.\n\nI will give it points for being different. And hey on the bright side here's a case where the original is missing so much that somebody could remake it this 10/20 years and might make an even better one, for once.", "I liked everything about it except the gingerbread men and killer toys. They turned everything that was, until that point where they showed up, a dark horror into a horror comedy. They were campy as hell. The elves at least were pretty creepy. Thing is this was completely predictable if you knew anything about the myth of Krampus but even though I predicted it all it was still a good movie in my opinion. ", "I'm going to go against the grain and say this movie is pretty terrible. The entire set up to the horror element was generic Christmas family shlock with mediocre performances. The lack of blood and gore was extremely distracting and I felt like the movie would have benefited from some more gruesome death scenes. None of the set up really goes anywhere. It shows Omi sharpening her knives and generally being a bad ass with first hand experience against Krampus but then she just never does anything for the rest of the movie. I thought when she confronted Krampus something cool might happen, but no.. nothing.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the ending.

Either you will love the first half and find the second half kind of useless or you will love both halves a little differently but find the whole experience perfect. I am of the latter camp. This is definitely a film that feels like an incredible short film and very long epilogue, but that's okay. What I love is that the first half's tension was so fraught and emotional that it always made me feel uneasy during the second half. It gave me a feeling of PTSD like no film ever had, never feeling comfortable in this new expanded world from Room, which is exactly where the characters are. I love that Donoghue knew that the story of a long kidnapped and abused woman readjusting to society has plenty of built in drama. Never did the film feel the need to resort to having Old Nick come back and try to kidnap Jack or becoming a protracted court case where it looks like Nick will get away with it. The film trusts its audience and as such tells two different but equally compelling stories.\n\nOn the acting side, both Larson and Tremblay give unbelievable performances. Watching Ma try to explain to Jack the escape plan was heart-wrenching because you know that no matter how abusive it felt it was in the goal of a much greater cause. Even small roles by Macy, McCamus, and Allen give a lot of weight to the final half. Also props to Abrahamson and his DP for finding new and fantastic ways to film the same space over and over.

It is easy to hate on Robert but I get where he is coming from, even if I did not agree with him.              \n\n        \n\nI was impressed by how much the director was able to do inside the room. It felt like their own private world at times when it was just Joy and Jack, and then you remember what a prison it is when Old Nick shows up.                       \n\nThe escape scene was arguably the most tense I felt at a movie this year. Right up there with anything in Sicario. Seeing how much Joy struggled with adapting to her freedom was the best part for me. Most movies would just end with them escaping and living happily ever. ", "How nuts am I for thinking Jacob Tremblay might actually be Leo's biggest competition at the Oscars?\n\nRoom is fantastic. I really like movies that handle single locations well because it provides such a great medium for character development. This was no exception. I think Lenny Abrahamson directed it perfectly. One of my favorite moments of the film was when Joy broke the news of how and why they were in Room. The way Larson's terrified seriousness plays with Tremblay's uncertain fear is beautifully natural. When Jack says, \"I don't believe you!\" it sounds just like every little kid when they find out the Easter bunny isn't real. But Tremblay follows it and fills it with a fear much more adult than you would expect in his situation. \n\nThat theme is explored later as he acts as his mother's \"strong\". Eventually, the film lands squarely on Jack's shoulders, physically and emotionally apart from his mother for the first time ever. The last third of the movie spends so much time emphasizing that Jack isn't with his mother so it can highlight his search for a sense of self in the real world. However, it doesn't abandon the influence his mother continues to have on him in a touching tribute to mothers with adult children. Jack plays with Legos *and enjoys it* because that's what his mom told him to do. \n\nMy favorite line of the film came out of nowhere: \n\nJack: When we dream, do we go to TV?  \nJoy: No Jack, we are always here.\n\nI think that pair of lines really sums up the movie's heart and soul. Room draws several parallels to growing up in the normal, not-kidnapped world. It asks a lot of the same questions people ask themselves throughout their lives as they grow. Are we here alone? Who abandoned us here? Who took us and left us to die? Why are we here? Its metaphors are aggressive and offer just criticism of modern society. Joy endures rape for seven years and then lurches back out into a world that only wanted to watch it in HD. The dialogue I quoted above succinctly states the dull and exhilarating truth that we are always *here*, and the question is what exactly that means.\n\nThere are so many movies that I'm yet to see and I'm excited for a lot of them, but I really don't know how anything could top Room this year. It's a fulfilled, beautiful film that never gets too big for itself. The director stares down so many difficult issues and demands exact answers from a fragile pair, leading to something genuinely, humanly *broken*. Start to finish, Room is courageous and impassioned with expert timing and depth.", "Super late to the party, but one thing that I thought this movie did exceptionally well was thinking about how a character would actually react and behave once coming out of the room. The biggest example for me was that Joy continually has very heavy, adult conversations in plain view of Jack. I took this to be because, since learning to become a mother, she has always been forced to have Jack right there, and therefore doesn't see the problem with him being there. Other adults are uncomfortable with his presence and her lack of willingness to separate him from the situation but Joy doesn't even seem to notice this. He has just always been there. She learned to be a mother in the room and has taken those same habits into the real world where they don't always apply anymore.\n\nJack not knowing how to use stairs was another really well done example. That kind of thing would have been easy to overlook. The movie was very well written and very well directed", "The escape scene had my boyfriend and I extremely tense. The overdose scene was also very intense. Going back to Room after everything happened also put it into perspective. I bought the book on Amazon after watching this movie, and I am excited to see how they complement each other.", "Great movie. You can barely breathe for the first 45 minutes. Really makes the viewer think about the human condition and how one's environment alters life. Jacob Trembley should have been nominated for best actor, he's great.", "Absolutely loved the film. I really enjoyed how the film portrayed the story through Jack's perspective. The film did a really good job having us both feel like Jack does at some moments. For example, when Jack sees the sky for the first time, I actually felt like I was seeing the sky for the first time. I felt like that the sky was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and I never wanted to stop staring at it.\n\nBrie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give such fantastic performances as Joy and Jack, respectively, but I also really liked Joy's mom and Leo. It was really interesting how Joy's own father could barely look at Jack while Leo took Jack in as if he was his own grandson. \n\nOverall, the film is very touching and will make you cry either out of happiness or sadness. I highly recommend this film to any one. **A+**", "I enjoyed it but it felt a little uneven in spots. The film really rides on the performances of the two leads and they both knock it out of the park. I'm glad the 2nd half dealt with PTSD rather than some sort of drama with the kidnapper or some other invented antagonist, but I felt that Joy's storyline ends abruptly after the suicide attempt.\n\nThe nod to her line in the interview about a father being a father because of what he does rather than biology was a nice reference to the difference in how her father and stepfather acted. Most other films would have had the stepfather become an antagonist instead of a genuine good guy who steps up to his role as a father figure even though he's biologically not.", "Brie Larson is an incredible actress (go watch Short Term 12) and Jacob Tremblay delivered a staggering performance but the one that got me was Joan Allen. She was a  tender yet powerful figure, who ends up being the rock for the family. \n\nWhat a movie. It's going to stick with me for a while. Easily Top 5 of the year maybe numero uno. ", "I loved this film so much, it's my #1 of the year so far. Reading all the overwhelmingly positive comments here I'm surprised the poll is currently only at a 76%. I'm sure that will change as more people see the movie though. The acting is incredible from Tremblay and Larson. I can't remember the last time a movie made me as tense as I was during the escape sequence. I found myself tapping my feet and couldn't get myself to stop. Even though I knew going in that half the movie was in room and half was set after they escape, it is still a little bit jarring when the switch is first made. But seeing how they handle them dealing with life after room was just as interesting in its own way.    \nAlso, a fun fact, Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson made almost all of the drawings and craft projects that were in room. Also, they removed certain tiles to film from outside the space instead of just removing a whole wall, to really create the feeling for the actors of being in this confined space. I think these little efforts are what helps pull such genuine performances. Really glad to see this movie is getting the attention it deserves.", "Incredible performances by Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, and Joan Allen. With Tremblay I didn't feel like I was watching a child actor on screen which is almost always the case. He carried half the movie with what seemed like effortless ease so I'm glad that he's getting praise all round for his performance. \n\nAnd while the movie touched on sensitive topic areas, I thought the balance between that and humour told from Jack's perspective was done just right.", "So who do you think has the better chance of winning the Oscar? Brie Larson or Cate Blanchett (Carol)?\n\nI enjoyed the movie, was so great and touching. I hope Tremblay rises up now because he deserves to be", "Interesting thing I haven't seen pointed out: people have been saying that Joy was breastfeeding Jack in room, but they weren't sure. I think this can be confirmed by near the end, when he tugs on her sweater and she says, \"No, there's no more\". \n\nAnother thing: Maybe I'm a terrible person, but when Nick says \"You just keep him locked up in there all night? That's kind of messed up\" I laughed really hard at his total lack of a sense of irony. ", "I got emotionally devastated by this movie and cried multiple times for the first time in years (grown ass man).", "Tommy Wiseau was a horrible actor and all the lines seemed terribly played out. The fact that they used the same footage for multiple scenes was also very bad. I know the movie is kind of old, but seriously? They couldn't do any better?", "Room is fantastic, funny, and also impassioned. I think this is easily one of the best films the year. My heart was pumping so fast when Jack was trying to escape, that was one of the best parts in the movie for sure. Jacob Tremblay and Brie Laraon better get some awards for their prodigious performances.", "Just watched this last night and all I can say is wow, what an incredible movie.  Movies like this are exactly what I'm looking for, but rarely find these days.  Incredible deep subject matter but doesn't rely on any movie cliches that I expected.  I was so glad that Nick didn't make another appearance later in the movie, I totally thought he was going to show up when they were bring in groceries or when Jack and that other kid were playing together. Also that escape scene had a crazy affect on me while watching it, was one of the most intense things I've ever seen, had chills the entire time.  When Jack was getting pulled back by Nick and reached out the note to the guy w/ the dogs I freaking lost it.  Same as when they went back to Room at the end.  The movie did an incredible job of making Room feel like it's own world to us, then we travel to the real world alongside Jack, and when we go back to Room at the end we almost feel as Jack does because it looks so tiny compared to before.  So fucking powerful.  10/10 for me.", "I would have loved to see him blow out some candles on his 6th birthday to end the movie.  One of the better movies I have seen in a long time though!", "This was the best kid actor I've ever seen, huge accomplishment from the director to get such a performance. Wow. ", "This movie was awesome!  So much information was conveyed without words.  After the escape, all of the strangers (especially the men) seem so overwhelming and menacing!  You can also see Joy reliving the trauma at different points (like when she is laying on the bed and Jack is watching tv shows on the phone).", "My favorite 2015 film by far.  \n\nWhat I keep thinking about is how adaptable the human mind is and how \"reality\" is relative, whether in \"Room\" or \"World\".  So here we have a fascinating insider view of a child experiencing a reality that fits inside a 10' x 10' room, almost as if it were an extension of the womb, just mother and child.  Jack's emergence into World is as jarring as birth must be.\n\nFascinating film.", "Caught this movie a few weeks ago. Jesus, once I started crying **I couldn't stop.** Really powerful stuff. Even though you know Ma and Jack escape room if you've seen the trailer, I was still very tense during that sequence. I've read from quite a few sources that Brie Larson has the lock for best actress, but I honestly felt her performance, while great, was more supporting. Jacob Tremblay was very impressive for such a young actor, and I felt that the role of Jack was more lead than supporting. I also really liked how the film didn't turn into a courtroom drama. Overall the film was very sensitive and moving, would highly recommend. ", "Fucking powerful. ", "this movie is absolutely incredible", "Loved this movie especially the camera work, making the room look big at the start and small in the end and with seeing what jack saw. Breathtaking. I saw the trailer and knew most of what was going to happen, the escape and the room, but the movie had my attention every second and my heart was in a knot during the escape.\n\n\nI have a few questions that bothered me though, but not enough to not think it's a great movie.\n\n\nFirstly, the lock bothered me. Every time Old Nick opened and closed the door, you could clearly hear how many buttons he was pushing. And as there were no evidence of other locks, or the lock ever being changed, one would think seven years is enough time to crack the code, especially in a little room nowhere to go and not a lot to do? I know this seems daft and that she most probably gave up, but the absolute only plans she made to escape were killing him and pretending her son died. There's only so many combinations, that figuring that out should have been an option before risking her and jack's life? A lot of things could have gone wrong.\n\n\nSecondly, I was sad not to see the grandpa come back. It felt like unfinished business? One can only assume that he couldn't look at jack because he was a child of the kidnapper, but nothing was confirmed and when he heard she was alive, he flew immediately to her so he clearly cared for her, but because of jack he once again immediately left his daughter whom he hadn't seen in 7 years?  Did her mom have an affair and that was the reason they broke up or was it because of the missing child? A lot of lawyer talk was going on, why was the grandpa so involved with that and then disappeared? What was up with the whispering and the lawyers?\n\n \nThird, the guy who saved jack never again made an appearance? He left as soon as the cops came. Why wasn't he curious what happened to the kid and why didn't her parents thank him for saving their girl and staying with jack until the cops left? He gave a description saying it was a red truck, which led to the satellite picture?\n\n\nLastly where is Old Nick? I'm glad that he didn't go back and kill her.. but why wasn't there a search for him and his truck? They didn't mention him after the escape, which means he was never captured. I mean even if he doesn't come back for them, he has successfully captured a girl for seven years who is to say he wouldn't just kidnap another girl and just keep doing what he was doing, except next time check if the kid was really dead? Creepy to say the least. Joy doesn't know who he is but a blood sample from jack could easily identify him. \n\n\n\nI know this is a long list but if anyone could help put my mind at rest, I would appreciate it!! Thanks :)\n", "Okay we just met grandma and grandpa and I have sobbed uncontrollably three times and I'm not sure I've ever cried in a theater before", "I'm honestly wondering how many people complaining actually saw it.   I understand hating the movie...bit some of these comments make it sound like the people haven't even seen it \n\n\n\"This is so unrealistic. He would need counselling\"   \n\n\nYeah...that's why he was in it?\n\n\n", "When I see media coverage of cases like this in real life, I obviously feel bad for the victims, but I watch the news eagerly with a craving for new information; in particular the impressions of the sufferers. Its a detached and morbid curiosity that I think most of us can relate to. But after being in room with Joy and Jack and witnessing first hand their harrowing ordeal, I found myself infuriated at the behaviour of the media; crowding their garden, asking insensitive though valid questions in the interview. For all intents and purposes I felt that I had been through the trauma with them and truly felt righteous indignation on behalf of them. I was irate and protective and in future I won't be so eager to see media coverage of incidents like this.", "Finally got to to see it. My favorite movie of the year by far.  \nI was on the edge of my seat when Jack was on the truck, holly sh*t I was fearing for the worst. Him to get buried or otherwise disposed in the backyard, unable to get out from the rug, or what almost happened not being able to contact anyone and getting caught. I was almost certain Ma was going to be dead when they arrived and to see her run up to Jack, tears of joy were shed.  \nOnce outside it was nice to see him grow less afraid of the world and its people as the film progressed. The whole cast was amazing.  \nOn a side note what a fantastic performance from William H. Macy, that scene was gut wrenching.  \n\nThe ending hopefully brought Jack closure as that was the world he knew. Who are we to blame a child for wanting to go back to that horrible place.  ", "I don't know how much of a spoiler this is but...\nEveryone thought jack was a girl right? I can't tell if that was like a twist or not. I thought he was said  to be a boy to protect from old jack\nBut now I feel dumb ", "The only drawback for the film for me was how sound mixing. The soundtrack was too loud at certain key moments, especially the final scene. In moments where the music is supposed to subtly enhance the emotion of the moment, it instead overpowered it. While I was absolute floored at many points in the film, I couldn't quite feel the emotion in those moments when the music forced it on me. Thus my 9/10 rating.", "Okay. Could be a dumb question. But why didn't she try to figure out the code to the door all those years? She knows it's three digits because of the number of beeps she can hear when he unlocks it. She could have kept a list starting at 000, 001, 002, etc, hidden it under the bed or somewhere else, and worked on it during the day when she knew him to be at work. Sure, there are millions (I'm not a math person, so correct me if I am WAY off) of possible combinations, but she had SEVEN YEARS - the first two of which were childless. It's not like she didn't know what day of the week it was or when he'd be gone, because she can count around Sundays. I know that there are a lot of elements at play here but I think that's what I would have done. Thoughts?\n\nEdit - I did not know that in the book she had a pregnancy before Jack. So the first two years were not entirely childless, but she didn't have a full grown child to occupy her time.", "I just watched the movie after a cursory glance at the rotten tomatoes score and nothing else. Seriously can't stop crying. At a bar and sobbing into my beer. ", "The movie is really, really good, with neatly written characters and storyline that makes you anxious to know the rest of it during the first half.\n\nVery good acting. Really, very good.\n\nBut you know what really grinds my gears? That the first sentence of every description of the \"Room\" includes too much information.\n\nIf you don't know what the movie is about and you like strong drama films, JUST WATCH IT, don't read descriptions or reviews. My wife watched it knowing literally zero about the plot and she enjoyed it more than me. I enjoyed it, too. Duh. But I guess I'd enjoy it more not knowing whether Ma and Jack will succeed in [you know what].", "Yo just saw this film and I have to say it's one of the best films of 2015 that went under radar for most people. We all know Brie Larson is a talent powerhouse but what impressed me the most was the kid actor. Jacob Tremblay is going places man. Acting was on point. The escape scene had my heart pounding the whole time.  Brie Larson already won GG but she really deserves an Oscar for this role.  ", "That escape scene along with the cutting off arm scene in 127 hours are the two most intense scenes in film I've seen in recent memory. God damnit that was good! ", "I just saw this today. I had no idea what it was about which led to an interesting reveal as you put together the early clues: No windows, the same small space, the eery ghostish qualities of the man who came in to the room every so often. My initial thoughts were some under-ground nuclear war bunker or that she was a totally crazy agoraphobe, but it came together eventually.\n\nBut the movie was incredibly powerful. It used such a crazy and unbelievable premise to push you towards such an emotional end. I identified with Jack's emotions so much that all I wanted in the entire world of this film was for him to be happy and safe. I felt so viscerally how big, foreign, and scary the 'world' was and everytime some small trivial piece of it was the least bit positive, I was just engulfed in happiness and relief.  I found myself in tears multiple times. \n\nThe use of Jack's pov was done very well. Not overhanded or cliche, but just enough to bring the viewer into his world. All his 'damages' because of circumstance felt so real and the tension of Joy's battle with such an unimaginable horror and the love of her and Jack, a direct product of that horror, made for an amazing dramatic experience. \n\nThis film was a real treat and I hope others see it with similar eyes.  \n\n", "Just saw this movie. Very powerful and moving. Larson and Tremblay were amazing, personally I thought Tremblay stole the show. I have a younger brother and he captured that childhood spirit so well it was ridiculous. He definitely deserved an Oscar nod for his efforts. It's sad to know events like these happen in this world. When he first gets out of the blanket and sees the sky I almost teared up. A very good movie.", "Great movie. I thought the escape was a little implausible since I think he would've checked the rug to see for himself, but that's not too major of an issue. Extremely intense when Jack is trying to describe the situation to the cops. I was sure Old Nick was headed straight back to kill her or something awful like that. ", "Ever since they were in the hospital after escaping the room I thought they were going to reveal that Jack was actually a girl. Anyone else got that feeing too? I was kind of disappointed that it didn't happen. But haven't seen any discussions in that topic. \nI was sure the doctor was talking about that when he said they should address this while he was still plastic. \n\nIn my mind, Jack was a girl but Ma kept that from Old Nick so he didn't try to abuse her too. And was afraid to tell him/her. \nIs that too over the top? ", "I have a quick question: Did we ever find out what the doctor recommended to Joy in the hospital that she said was confidential information? I believe she brought it up to the mom during their fight as well. I'm sure it's supposed to be inferred but for some reason I'm blanking.", "Hello, I've been trying to find a place to ask a couple questions about the movie \"Room\" and it took me to this website.  First of all I must say that the movie was AMAZING!!!!  It's one of the movies that moved me to tears, and in not one specific scene but in multiple scenes.  Brie Larson is phenomenal as Joy.  She is my favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar.  I highly doubt I can think of anyone who could beat her even though I love Jennifer Lawrence.  Of course, she already had her glory with \"Silver Linings Playbook\" so I say it's time to give someone else a chance at the spotlight so why not Brie this time?\n\nOkay, with that out of the way, I do need to ask about a couple plot holes I found in the movie.  I should mention that I have never read the book so maybe it's better explained there.  Okay, first of all, was it ever revealed the reason Joy ended up in the shack?  I know she talks about her life to Jack before, but how did she actually end up in the shack?  Was she kidnapped by Old Nick?  Also, is Old Nick an old boyfriend or her ex-husband?  I got the idea that Joy was raped by Old Nick, and that it had to have happened after Joy had lived in the shack for quite some time.  The film starts on Jack's 5th Birthday and it is established that Joy had been in the shack for seven years.  So she had to have lived in the shack a good year before she was raped and had Jack.\n\nThe other question I have happens near the end.  After Joy is released from the hospital from her suicide attempt, she and Jack are on her bed.  Jack is seen pulling on Joy's sweater and Joy is saying, \"No Jack, mommy's empty\" or something like that (forgive me for paraphrasing).  When I saw that, I had to ask myself, \"Was Joy still breastfeeding Jack even after he turned five?\"  We know Jack is able to eat solid food because he had some of the birthday cake at the beginning of the movie and we see him eat cereal and other foods so it makes me wonder what that little moment was all about.  Actually, there was a scene earlier when they were still in the shack (can't recall if it was in a flashback or real time so I apologize for not remembering) where  Joy is holding Jack and it looks like she has him in a position where she is breastfeeding him, and with Jack's long hair, you know it was pretty recent.\n\nI honestly have not been able to find any information about this from the synopsis I have read on Wikipedia or even people's comments.  If ANYONE has any clarification on this it would be greatly appreciated!  As I said before, these points don't take me away from the movie because overall, it is a very powerful film!  I just think I can be more at ease knowing the answers of the questions I asked.  Once again, thank you for reading and I look forward to reading your responses.", "I found this film to be so compelling. Most of the time when you see a story like this brought to the screen, it either tries to cram the \"escape\" into the first fifteen minutes or the last fifteen minutes--and either way the audience is cheated the full examination of what has been endured or what will be endured. *Room* balanced it out perfectly, and even handled the shift in tone perfectly (at least IMO). What really struck me was how it managed to convey Jack's hope and joy (preserved by his mother no matter what) and then shift to the hopelessness and confusion of Ma's reality after the escape, and then back to the authentic hope they both share towards the end, all while feeling consistent and real to me. This could have been a maudlin film, it could have been an exploitative film, but it didn't fall into any of the potential pitfalls. Brie Larson has been slowly racking up a list of strong performances:  *Short Term 12*, *The Spectacular Now*, *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World*. If you haven't seen *Short Term 12* do yourself a favor and check it out, it's a great film and her performance shows a subtlety that is impressive for an actor he age. Everyone's been losing their shit over Jennifer Lawrence as a critical darling (and I like her, don't get me wrong) but Larson's been there working hard and I hope she gets recognition for this role. And, of course, Jacob Tremblay gave an amazing, heartbreaking performance. He took dialogue that felt a tad stale and on-the-nose to me and made it believable (specifically I'm thinking about the argument he has with his mother about The World and TV). ", "I just saw this film after watching snippets from last night's Oscars.  This is a modern classic, hands down.  Usually with this type of film, i.e. escape films, they focus too hard on making the escape **the** point of the movie, a 'will they won't they' device.  However, with Room, they managed to make everything, like Joy's strict diet for Jack, seem as though it was her long plan for escaping.  We knew the escape was going to happen, but this took it a step further by showing us the aftermath and recuperation of their lives.  \n\nEven the slow parts weren't slow by accident.

Was interested to see that it was a lot more grounded than that. \n\nI want to say I really enjoyed this movie, but I guess appreciated would be the better word.

This could as easily have been a run-of-the-mill dinosaur cartoon with no greater explanation. That central question was completely irrelevant as the movie did nothing innovative or clever with it. Also, what good does it do to ask that question and only show like five different dinosaurs in the entire movie? \n\nWhat I do think the movie did good was Spot himself (LOVED him) and the scene where they buried the sticks with Arlo, which actually make me get teared up.\n\nThe visual effects were breathtaking and I didn't hate the character design as much as other people did but the film just felt so...meager.", "Movie itself: decent. Not a Pixar masterpiece, but enjoyable. \n\nThe animation: holy shit, I think this may easily be the most impressive environment animation we have ever seen on the big screen. The dinosaur animation was cartoony but fine; the environment was breathtaking. There were many scenes that, if you removed the characters, I wouldn't be able to tell you if it was a real photo or not. Gorgeous and stunning. I could watch a whole film like this without characters, just the camera panning over the landscapes. I really hope Pixar reuses this technology for a future film with realistically matching characters ", "Extremely visually appealing, but very light on the story. It definitely wasn't up to Pixar's standards, and I feel they put more effort into inside out. Im disappointed in how generic this was.", "I think back to how amazed I was at the landscape watching \"Up\" and after seeing the animation on this movie, I was blown away yet again. Such a beautiful movie!\nBut yeah, a pretty straight forward story, but still very good and pretty funny. Couldn't help but draw parallels to the Hyenas and Mufasa in The Lion King, Sharks in Nemo and of course the death of a parent in most Disney stuff.", "It felt odd, pacing wise, that the adventure didn't start at the same time as Arlo's dad got washed away with Arlo being swept away at the same time. Arlo is back on the farm for all of 3-5 minutes before Spot pops back up, he falls into the river, and gets washed away anyway. The only thing I could think was it was to establish the fact that Arlos dad had died. \n\n*BUT*...\n\nWhat if we *didnt* know his dad was dead for sure? How much of a freaking punch to the gut would it have been to have the father pop up later in the movie like he did? We would've thought \"yay! Dads found! Journeys over!\" only to find out that he's been dead all along? But only realizing that he was dead *after* Arlo had decided that he couldn't just go home and leave Spot and had to go save him! That would've been up there with the BingBong scene for me. ", "I feel like this film is set at a disadvantage. Inside Out came out this year, and it's a fast paced quirky comedy that's literally about emotional manipulation. But The Good Dinosaur is a different kind of film. It's kinda slow, it doesn't have a sturdy plot structure, it's weird and meanders and it's one of the most visually focused films Pixar has ever made. I really loved it. I loved it more than Inside Out. This is, honest to god, probably my 2nd favorite pixar movie right behind Monsters Inc. \n\nThis movie has really REALLY amazing visuals, and I'm not just talking about how realistic the environments are. The inverted \"Jaws\" shot with the pterasaur beaks peaking through the clouds, the vision of Arlo's dad not leaving footprints, the older man howling and growing as he stands, the lightning in Arlo's eyes\u2026 the visuals in this film are sticking with me. This is one of my favorite movies of the year.", "Definitely not top-tier Pixar, but I feel a lot of the reviewers are being too harsh. If this film was made by any other studio it would get a lot more praise. I did go into it knowing that it wouldn't be nearly as good as the masterpiece that is Inside Out, however. Still, it was better than I expected. \n\nI can go on about the animation for several paragraphs but I will say that this is absolutely the best animated Pixar film by far. Save for the character designs, this is as photorealistic as it gets. Completely breathtaking. Arlo's family being farmers was one of the more cool and creative aspects of the film for me, and I wish we had gotten to see more of how the dinosaurs evolved in this alternate universe.\n\nI also enjoyed the humor in the film. There wasn't a lot of it, but they almost went full-stop \"Pink Elephant\" there. For what little characters there were, I liked most of them. I did feel underwhelmed about those vulture-things as villains. Pixar has had stronger villians in the past that have done more than put our hero in just physical danger.\n\n8.5/10 Simple, yet emotional and effective. I cried 3 times. The scene with Arlo and Spot communicating about their families is pure gold, easily best scene in the film. Pixar still proves that they are masterful at working with scenes with little-to-no-dialog. The film does have the disadvantage of reminding the audience of many other animated films, like The Land Before Time and the Croods, but it didn't make the film any less heartwarming for me.\n\nThe short Sanjay's Super Team was incredible. That might just be my favorite short of theirs now.", "I loved the part where they got high AF.", "I thought it was kinda mediocre. The two main problems I had were one, it felt way more aimed at kids than the whole family, and two, it didn't take advantage of the whole \"meteor misses earth\" idea. I expected something like the bug city in Bug's Life, not dinosaurs talking like people and that's about it. Also, the story was waaaaaay too standard.", "Anyone catch any easter eggs? I was too mesmerized by the amazingness of the animation to catch a single easter egg.", "I... was not expecting to cry *three* separate times. Even Inside Out only got me once.", "took my 4 year old daughter to it tonight.  She loved it.  Normally during movies she asks to leave 75% of the way through them.  Tonight she watched the entire movie with no complaints.  I was laughing so hard during some scenes and sitting in wonder during the rest.  \n", "The moment with the camouflaged dinosaur with all of the critters quite literally made me, for a just a second, consider the possibility that I had somehow been drugged. It was just so unexpected and strange and then it only got stranger.", "A cool fact about this movie is that the director, Peter Sohn, based the interaction between Spot and Arlow on his own experiences with his mother. His mother was Korean and didn't really speak English unlike him, so they never truly shared a language, but they understood each other with body language, just like Arlo and Spot. I loved that.\n\nI don't know about you guys but that scene with the stick family between Arlo and Spot ...I just lost it. I haven't cried in a movie that hard since the BingBong \"Take her to the moon for me!\" scene. \n\nAll in all I loved this movie. The message, \"You have to learn how to live with fear\" was a fantastic one. The characters were great (Sam Elliott as the T-Rex was my favorite thing), great villains, a surprising amount of death, and just amazing animation. Honestly I sort of liked it better than Inside Out.  \n\nAlso I love how they made the T-Rex characters good instead of evil, and the hallucinating scene was really animated fantastically. ", "\"You're me and more\"\n\nHoly shit, the feels on that line", "A truly beautiful movie that far surpassed my expectations of it.  I ended up crying a few different times, in fact, and it was both more peaceful and more brutal than I have come to expect from animated films.\n\nI think it has a somewhat Ghibli-esque vibe, using beats of peace and landscape frequently, giving it a very contemplative feel that I really appreciated.  I think overall the adults in the theater last night enjoyed it more than the kids.  It has its issues relating to formula (very little doesn't these days, but this will definitely harken to other animated classics a little too heavily), it's not fascinating plotwise at the baseline and I do have criticisms of the characters and some repetition, but I personally wasn't too bothered.  Pondering more on the symbolism and tragedy of it does keep me interested, so though the plot was simple I continue to examine it, heh\n\nThe preceeding short, Sanjay's Super Team, is easily the best Pixar short in my book.  It lacks the trite cutesy feel of some previous shorts; it's just gorgeous as well as speaking to issues I think many folks with culturally traditional parents can relate to.", "What I've learned is that I personally need to see Pixar movies now, rather than go off of reviews.  I thought that The Good Dinosaur was by far the best Pixar (and Disney) film since Toy Story 3.  It had soul, powerful imagery of the Tetons/Wyoming, and a very compelling storyline.\n\nI think Pixar is at its best when they don't tell stories about humans, or when the story is explicitly spelled out.  Good Dinosaur relied a lot on Wall-E's dialogue-less approach, as well as Lion King's loss of the father character.  It presented such a compelling western example, and left room for you to read into things if you wanted to.  I enjoyed how Pixar defined what a \"critter\" was by giving it those vacant, black eyes.  It was also interesting to see the evolutionary \"intelligence\" of the dinosaurs - the creativity of their farming and herding aside, I was particularly taken with how Butch (for example) recognizes that his family could eat Arlo, but doesn't (and instead has a conversation).  You are left to decide for yourself if a dinosaur is dangerous; you can't just look at their teeth here and decide what their intention might be.  Even the way that the dinosaurs moved was interesting - the T. Rex's lower body moving like a horse, and their upper body positioned like a rider.\n\nThe film had a lot of adult elements.  I feel The Good Dinosaur was a lot more accessible to older age groups or adults, while Inside Out was more cutesy, fun, and linear.  As I mentioned previously, for me, Pixar's films are the most enrapturing when they are not about humans.  The emotiveness that the company brings to non-humans is what I think is their strongest asset.  I could say the same for Spot in The Good Dinosaur as well - his dog-like traits were non-human, and was creative and interesting.  It made me think of the presentation of Boo in Monster's Inc: a human, but that isn't really the important part.  \n\nThough I believe Pixar is at its best when the human element is repressed or absent, my trust in Pixar to deliver a powerful film has been enforced by The Good Dinosaur, and despite its production problems, was delivered as another classic in their already vast repertoire.", "So in the end...did they all starve to death? \n\nThey had big trouble getting enough food together to survive the winter they said, and with Arlo gone that would have been even harder, Momma looked very ragged. When Arlo came back there was actually one more mouth to feed.\n\nThere should have been a montage showing Arlo teaching his family some of the stuff he learned on his journey - like where to find berries, and maybe interacting with Spot and his new family which let's face it are basically next door so I don't get why it was such a tearful goodbye. ", "After some time thinking on this movie, I have to say that it's a mixed bag, but ultimately brings more to the (Thanksgiving) table than it's taking off. \n\nStrengths:\n\n* The CG landscapes. Wow! The environments of this film look so photorealistic, I was questioning whether the entire film was just CG characters superimposed over environments that were filmed on location. Moreover, the environment's effects on how a character looks is second-to-none. When characters are wet from the rain, they look wet from the rain. When Arlo's knees are battered and bruised, they look battered and bruised. The environment is basically a character in this film and the Pixar animation team did an excellent job making you really feel the environment's presence throughout the film.\n\n* The character arc for Arlo and his relationship with Spot was very well done IMO. The turning points in their relationship and growing empathy towards each other make sense throughout the film. You can pick out specific points in which Arlo hates Spot, Arlo is on the fence about him but keeps him around as a utility, and when Arlo genuinely cares for him. \n\n* Sense of adventure. While I believe The Good Dinosaur is fairly derivative (more in that in a bit), I think it does do a great job conveying Arlo's journey back home and paralleling that with his personal growth. The incredibly crafted environments (and their variety) also help convey this sweeping sense of adventure. Furthermore, the film does a great job putting the audience in a state of fear, comfort, warmth, suspense, or awe when it wants to. \n\n* The supporting characters. I thought the character types were very interesting and made for some genuine surprise. Thunderclap was pretty menacing IMO and I couldn't help but laugh when the T-Rexes with overbite were portrayed as hillbillies/country folk.\n\n* Dreamcrusher. This joke deserves an entire point to itself.\n\n* The family circle scene. This was heartbreaking. The moment Spot knocks over the sticks and buries them under sand says so much to the audience (even to kids) without saying anything at all. Director Peter Sohn mentioned in the vignette before the film that there were certain moments in film that he didn't need to translate for his Korean mother at all. Moments that were so strong visually that they transcend the language barrier. This moment in The Good Dinosaur was one of those.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* Clich\u00e9s. The dream sequence with Arlo's not-really-alive father felt kind of cheap. It surprised me that Henry never came back from being swept up in the flood while Arlo, his younger, weaker, and less courageous son did. The moment in which Arlo's mother mistakes Arlo for Henry was both super-clich\u00e9 and extremely (unintentionally) comical. When it was done in The Lion King, it made sense because grown-up Simba actually does bear semblance to Mufasa. When it's done in The Good Dinosaur, we're meant to believe that Arlo's mom confuses an incredibly lanky spaghetti-legged dinosaur for a thick-limbed physically-imposing dinosaur who's at least a few feet taller. I understand the intent of this scene, but it comes off as silly when you think about it. \n\n* Treading familiar ground. Pixar's strongest films manage to be original and imaginative (think WALL-E, Finding Nemo, Toy Story, etc.). I was hoping that even though The Good Dinosaur basically has the same premise as The Land Before Time, that it would do something different with it. It's still the same basic story with the twist being that Arlo and Spot have to split up. When The Incredibles took the premise from Fantastic Four, they set it in a specific time period, blended in elements from Watchmen, and created a cast of well-rounded or memorable characters to make it feel like a fresh story. While The Good Dinosaur isn't the most unoriginal film I've ever sense, it does feel like one of the most unoriginal Pixar films I've ever seen. It feels very predictable in a few areas and I think it's due to the kinds of high-profile animated features it's taking inspiration from (Land Before Time, Lion King, etc.). \n\n* The message. Originally when I watched this, I thought this was a strong suit, but after really meditating on it, it's kind of disturbing. Despite spending the entire film taking care of Spot and both of them proving their loyalty/love for each other, Arlo gives him away to a group of random strangers. This would be acceptable if this was Spot's original family, but they aren't (the facial features and eye shape from that family to Spot are different). Either party would be adopting Spot into their family, but I just watched 60 or so minutes of Arlo basically becoming a bigger brother to Spot! And Arlo just gives Spot to a group of random strangers that he just met under the basis that they bear more of a physical resemblance to each other. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it seems like a weird message to send to kids that no matter what kind of connection you have with another person, certain people belong with their own kind... you can kind of see where I'm going here and why this might not be the best message to send to impressionable children.\n\nIf I were to rate it right now, I'd say it's about a 7.4/10. Very good movie, phenomally rendered environments, top-notch animation, great emotional core, good sense of adventure, but ultimately derivative and sends a bit of a strange message to children. I think it succeeds in all the places it needs to despite not being another A+ Pixar outing.", "Really strongly disliked it. I took my kids to see it opening night and they were not engaged by it at all, far too slowly paced for the attention spans of kindergarteners and below. Was therefore a mess to try to get them to sit still in the theater.\n\nThe story is very weak and I found several components of it offensive. I felt no connection to anyone and thought Arlo was really annoying. I didn't like Spot or humans in general acting like dogs. I didn't think any of it was cute, really.\n\nThe real disappointing thing here is there were many really promising characters that didn't really do anything, just fizzled out. I think I liked *everyone* more than Arlo and Spot. I thought Arlo's dad was cool. I thought the T-Rexes were cool. The crazeballs triceratops was funny and cool but disappeared immediately instead of tagging along to make the adventure amusing instead of ridiculously dull and tedious (I get that the tedium may have been part of the intent to convey a long journey home, but I don't find it pleasant). I thought the reavers or whatever they were called were cool. But I don't think they did anything substantial or meaningful with them.\n\nNone of the big emotional scenes clicked with me throughout the whole movie. Arlo's dad's death just didn't click as meaning anything other than doom for the already-struggling family farm. The T-Rex's big horror story was flat, not scary at all, and then they just say \"Bye kid, see ya later!\". Spot finding a human family was far too drawn out and not really congruent with the rest of the film. The bird cult was cool but they went overboard on the cult thing. \n\nYou don't even really have the excuse \"it's a kid's film\" because kids aren't fascinated with it. By the time they'll be able to appreciate TGD for its story content or the technical quality of the animation (which btw didn't really strike me as anything *particularly* special), they'd rather watch better movies.\n\n2/10 from me. Very disappointing.", "This was more a showcase of Pixar/Disney's technology than anything else. The sets were beautiful. We are truly at the boundary of animation and actual photography.\n\nIt was a cute story. I feel bad that this movie is sold as a kid's movie since it really doesn't deliver on the physical gags or fart jokes, IMO (\"I don't want to watch the rest,\" said the kid next to me). It's a Pixar film. It's not their best, but it has \"their mark\" (watch the movie).\n\nWhen I first saw the trailer I thought the cartoony characters were out of place from the sets. Now I kind of get what they were going for. They contrast their characters with the could-be-live-action backgrounds. It's a *beautiful* movie, visually, and a good movie, story-wise.  ", "This movie is extremely polarizing. Some people loved it, although uniformly saying not as good as Inside Out, but still up there while others say it was terrible.\n\nI think it's because the movie didn't really set the expectation of the movie goer.  Some people want a developed plot, others want to see stunning visuals, others just want to laugh.\n\nI found this movie to be remarkable I'm a sense that it was not original coming of age film, and it did seem strikingly similar to other past films, but it really did it well. Their absurd adventures along the way were so surprising, I never thought I would see those types of scenes in a. Disney/Pixar children's movie.  Some jokes were unapologetically adult in humor without disguising it as a funny kids joke.  That I appreciated a ton.\n\nPlus it constantly switched or broke traditional roles. Dad pushing son to overcome fear by pushing him past his limitations actually hurts him.  Parents are not always right. The human is the pet and Arlo is the master. The pterodactyls were guised as the dinosaur coast guard, yet they were vicious, while the T-rex were friendly and herders. \n\nThe constant juxtapositioning was refreshing to me and made me think about what prejudices I have.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this movie and I think it offers a lot more for people to think about when you pay attention to what the movie wants to convey.", "It was fine. A little too thematically similar to Lion King for me. The production troubles showed. Easily the weakest aspect is the story.\n\nI've read about the animation being beautiful, and I'm not sure if I'm on that same page. It's not ugly, but it's not the same majesty of creation you get from Nemo or Wall-E.\n\n7/10\n", "This movie honestly felt like Pixar just worked on a bunch of new tech for a few years (R&D) and then thought they could tell a simple journey story where the antagonist is the environment. Almost like the tech came first and then they sort of crammed a story into it.\n\nThe story just didn't feel well thought out. The asteroid misses earth and then over millions of years the dinosaurs evolve into farmers and ranchers and are smarter than humans? The whole \"what if dinosaurs didn't go extinct\" could have been left out. It's a super interesting idea, but here it felt rather tacked on. This whole build up was just to give the character a reason to get home which felt wasted. As soon as Arlo leaves the farm who cares about the dinos have evolved bit. The dinos could have been humans or lions or any other animal and the story wouldn't have changed a bit. This sort of helped explain Spot and his family, but again it just didn't quite fit.\n\nI love me some man VS nature stories and this movie had a lot of intense scenes. The nature, as other's have pointed out, was gorgeous to look at. It was beautiful in parts and threatening in others and it really played into the main characters emotions. Pixar did a wonderful job conveying this side of the story and I'd honestly see it again just to see that beautiful scenery. ", "Really wanted to love this one but I thought it was just OK. It didn't really feel like a Pixar film, felt quite Disney-lite throughout.\n\nThe environmental effects were AMAZING, but I thought they clashed with the more surreal character designs.", "[well, that went dark quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4LQ_Qe-k5I)", "I liked the movie, but not the ending. I don't buy that some random human family the kid never knew was somehow better than him being adopted by the dinosaur family...", "Disclaimer: I absolutely LOVE Disney/Pixar, think all of Pixar's movies range from \"good\" to \"amazing\" and consider Inside Out to be one of the best movies in Pixar's lineup.\n\nI just saw The Good Dinosaur last night and actually fell asleep a couple times.  The animation was absolutely beautiful, but the rest was pretty meh.  I didn't really care about Arlo conquering his fears, I didn't like how the dad's death was a straight rip off of Mufasa's death in Lion King (but with waaaay less emotion...I didn't like the dad at all and running off into the storm was stupid in the first place, so didn't feel much anything when he died), and I thought it was dumb that Spot just got randomly picked up by some random family just because they're humans (who crawl and grunt...but magically start to walk/hold hands/act like humans once they're together).  There were a couple funny gags here and there (twitchy dinosaur and his animal buddies) but overall I just felt it was extremely mediocre, the first Pixar film I've ever felt that way about.", "I had a feeling from the trailer that it was going to make me cry. Turns out it did.\n\nThe story overall is pretty simple, and the visuals are some of the best that I've seen from Pixar, but the movie itself faltered in some places (villains, in particular).\n\n", "I didn't understand the ending. Why did Arlow make Spot leave so he could go live with people he doesn't know just because they're the same species? Why is that good for anyone", "Has anyone else talked about the sheer amount if killing and violence for a kids movie? The bug getting full on decapitated complete with blood squirt, the critter getting eaten, the \"drowning him in my own blood\" line, the tearing through the pterodactyl's wing, Arlo drowning several pterodactyls. Like, holy shit.", "The good dinosaur completely missed the mark for me.  Most of the focus and a good chunk of the adversity in the movie comes from the environment itself.  For example:\n\n* Arlo is trying to reach some fruit standing on a rock.  Oh look he falls.\n* Arlo is trying to cross a big gap to reach some fruit.  Oh look he forms a cartoonish Flintstones bridge with his body.\n* Arlo's foot is trapped by a big stone.\n* Arlo's trapped at the bottom of a big cliff (after being pushed around by water).\n* Water is coming that will kill Arlo's dad.\n* Arlo's trying to swim the first time (floating down river).\n* Arlo's trying to swim the second time (pushed in by spot).\n* Arlo's trying to swim the third time (rescuing spot).\n\nThe physicality of his struggles might be interesting to a young child, but feels like a made for TV movie (or maybe just a TV show).  This is made worse by the sharp contrast between Arlo and the environment; or perhaps just Arlo's design.  The gummy cartoonish look lets us know that nothing too bad will happen.  He gets some bruises that only seem to impact him when it matters to that particular scene, otherwise he is running around fine.\n\nSpeaking of the character designs, there was a huge missed opportunity.  Too many characters had the exact same silhouettes -- will anyone remember any of the bird dinosaurs?  Could you even tell them apart unless they paused the action and let you know which one was the leader?   What about the Velociraptors?  Were the 3, 4, or 5 of them?  Could you tell them apart?   Will anyone remember ANY of these antagonists in 1 year's time?  Are any of them the least bit sympathetic / heroes of their own story?  \n\nThe one exception to this is the T-Rexs, they are the true stars of this movie.  They are somewhat distinct, with Butch's facial scaring and the daughter's tail.  \n\nThese scenes are also the only potentially humorous ones (outside of Spot pooping, I guess).  Did anyone laugh at \"re-elevation\"?  That sort of word play misses the mark for kids (who don't know revelation or elevation) and is just terrible.  They even had to explain it, and it still wasn't funny.  Same thing with the animals on a Triceratops.\n\nI enjoy a good Western, but this one takes all the style and none of the substance.  There were occasional touches that shows someone at Pixar still has an eye for detail (e.g. T-Rex's running like a rider on a horse), but this attention to detail was not applied to the overarching story or setting.\n\nFor example, they go to great lengths to show how Arlo's family could be dinosaurs.  They show you how they plant the crops.  How they water them.  How they shuck the corn.  Then they show you the chicken pen, and you see it's put together with twine and sticks.  Put together in such a fashion that Arlo's dad (or any of the family) would not have been able to construct it.  Much less fashion twine (or the rope they use to catch Spot initially).  Does this detail matter?  No, not on it's own.  But even Cars, one of Pixar's worst movies, took the situation of the character's seriously -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yusZ__hr7x4 \n\nInside Out had some pacing issues but at least it had an element of creativity and unpredictability.  The Forgettable Dinosaur follows the Disney formula to a D.  Maybe a D minus.\n\n", "The animation, from start to finish, was genuinely on another level to anything I've ever seen before. This might be the most technically accomplished film of the year.\n\nHowever, despite that, there was something rather disappointing about the film. The delay and complete rejig obviously caused problems and there's a sense that there are about three or four different films battling for breathing room. There were obviously too many cooks in the kitchen.\n\nThat said, there were moments of true Pixar charm that elevated the film to being a solid movie, even if it was mostly unremarkable. Certainly not even close to Inside Out.", "So this one was alright. Super simple. Basically a western movie with dinosaurs instead of people. The environment was just stunning. They definitely captured nature perfectly. I felt like I was in Yellowstone and Teton National Park. I guess I guest expected more from a Pixar movie. Not many laughs but the Arlo/Spot relationship was cute. \nAnd of course the obvious Disney life adversity thing, killing off a parent like they always have to do. \nIt just felt like to me a super sized short. The whole thing could have a 15 min short and we would have come away with the same thing. Doubt I'll watch it ever again. It gets a B- from me. ", "This movie is all over the place and rarely is that place what makes a good movie.  Yes, the backgrounds were GORGEOUS but the animation style clashes with them in a really unsettling way.  This is a Hero's Journey style movie but, if you remember, the mother tells the main character that he has to pick up the slack of his dead father or they will die in the winter.  Arlo almost immediately disappears only to roll up on the cusp of winter.  One more mouth to feed, the movie tells you they're all going to die.\n\nWhy the useless characters?  Why did the triceratops feature so heavily in the marketing only to be on screen for 5 minutes in an OMG SO RANDOM pseudo cameo that could have been skipped completely.\n\nAs with so many movies it falls apart almost completely in the 3rd act.", "I thought it was very good. Was it Pixar's best? No. But a decent Pixar movie, almost every time (Cars 2 as the exception) is going to be a very good movie overall.\n\n7.5/10 for me. Story fell flat at times, and some scenes seemed, well, off (like the psychadelic trip scene), but it was overall a very good movie.\n\nOne slight warning is if you have kids who are emotionally sensitive. My daughter (6) was a sobbing mess at the end.", "While the director's intro was touching and all that, I hated seeing a director explain to me what the movie means to him before I even get to see it. What he's trying to say should be felt through the movie - all I could think about while watching the thing was him pulling the strings behind the curtain. Kind of spoiled the experience a bit.", "Visually it was absolutely beautiful. You could take almost any frame of this movie and hang it on your wall and it would look gorgeous.\n\nStorywise, it had a few problems here and there. I felt like the beginning was a little rushed, and Arlo's fearfulness could have used a bit more development. Also, I felt like some of the supporting characters were really underused (especially Arlo's brother and sister). The T-rexes and the Pterodactyls were really entertaining, though. Some aspects were predictable, particularly the stuff involving Arlo's father (The old \"Disney movie parents must die\" rule at work).\n\nThe dynamic between Arlo and Spot was really well done, though. I honestly wasn't expecting the initial dislike Arlo had towards him at the beginning, and I think that really helped with their development.\n\nOverall, it had problems, but I still really enjoyed it. Not Pixar's best, but I would happily watch it again.", "I think I've only seen two or so of the trailers, so I didn't expect this to be more-or-less a Wild West movie with dinosaurs. The fact that all the ones in the movie were native to what would be North America is a nice touch (the rustlers might actually be Deinonychus or Utahraptors, especially considering the size, rather than Velociraptors, which were from Mongolia). Even the way Butch and his kids galloped like a cowboy on a horse was a really neat tidbit.\n\nYeah, the story's pretty basic, but simplicity isn't always a bad thing.

I can't help but compare it to Inside Out, where I couldn't care about the movie as a whole because I had a hard time relating to a lot of the characters, but it was excellent story and adventure.  It's wasn't hard for me to related to the characters in The Good Dinosaur, but there's a lot to be desired from the character development and the story.

At the end, Spot just finds a new family-- it's just that easy? Some scenes were pretty cool, like when the evil dudes were dipping in and out of the storm clouds. But for the most part, it looked like a nature documentary with weird CG characters placed in it to me. Oh, also, the part where Spot and Arlo ate the rotten fruit and they started to trip out.

I loved the redneck/country T Rexes, I thought they were absolutely hilarious and the whole western theme was pretty cool. I also like the design of the T Rexes and how the dad T Rex was voiced by Sam Elliot. Sometimes the cartoon art style of the dinosaurs looked weird with the photo realistic backgrounds but it didn't bother me to much. It still looked gorgeous. The mountain and forest landscapes reminded me of environments in Skyrm. I also enjoyed Arlo and his interaction's with his family in the beginning. Not the best Pixar movie and the trailer made it seem more funny and kind of like Ice Age when its not too much of a comedy but more of a coming of age story.

", "I loved how they introduced each opponent with his record and accomplishments. ", "The movie was incredible. It managed to appeal to the longstanding Rocky fans as well as it's own movie telling it's own story. It's a worthy installment to the Rocky saga, but bridges the gap and sets the franchise up to go in a new direction.\n\n\nI read it in another review, the movie managed to pick the right choice every single time in how they could have handled \n \nThey managed to make their own movie and style, while showing respect and fan service to the Rocky franchise. None of it seems forced or contrived, it's done in a way that allows this movie to feel honest. There's A LOT of interesting story being thrown out there. You could think that there's too many heavy thematic moments and ideas being thrown around.. but they handle it all really well. You have the coming of age story of Adonis, his struggles accepting his name and his father, the father/son relationship with Rocky, his relationship with Bianca, and then the boxing story of him finally getting a chance to prove what he can do. And it almost all works.\n \nThere's a few moments where it's a little heavy-handed.. but it's a  unavoidable. It's a boxing movie, sometimes the boxing is life metaphors are going to jab you in the face and stun you (BUT THATS LIFE AND THATS WHERE WINNING IS DONE). However, it doesn't hurt the movie.. it's a staple of the genre and franchise, so those moments are handled genuinely.\n \nI read a review asking for a little less Rocky and I wouldn't have been too mad at that, but only because Adonis and Bianca were great characters and you wanted to see more of them. But if this is the movie that bridges that gap between the two franchises, you needed Rocky to have the role he did.. because he still had story left to tell. Stallone really was excellent.. and he played this version of Rocky really well. I almost like older Rocky better than young Rock. You can tell he loves this character and really puts his weight and sincerity behind it.\n \nMichael B. Jordan is a phenomenal actor. He could portray the anger and frustration just as easily as he could be vulnerable and guarded. But credit to him and Coogler that it was never blatantly obvious when they were playing the \"BUT I NEVER KNEW MY DADDY!!\" card.. there were more subtle than that. We saw a little bit of that Creed arrogance here and there, but I imagine we'll really see that in the next movie(s).\n \nSoundtrack was great too, the cinematography was well done.. the fight in the middle that was shot as a single take and it was brilliant. Just can't say enough positive things about it. This is how you handle a modern take on an older property. It's someone who took an existing franchise and wanted to do something different and nailed it.\n\nAnd overall, there were a lot of moments where I just found myself smiling ear to ear. Whether it was a training montage, a reinvented classic Rocky moment (climbing the stars, running in the streets with the motor bikes, etc.), a reference to a previous Rocky movie, an awesome kick of the soundtrack, I was just wildly entertained throughout the movie.

Also, when he mentions his son has moved to Vancouver; in standard Rocky fashion he still says nothing negative. The scene is played so well by Sly as you can hear the pain in his voice.

I liked that it didn't play on the cliche of I need to get out of the \"hood\" and make it better for myself story. Instead, Adonis was coming from a place of wealth and comfortability. He had a great job and a great person who took care of him. He had \"the life,\" but he gave it all away to do what he loves. A lot of young people, including myself want to be successful, but I think for the wrong reasons, we want the fancy cars, the big house, and just stacks and stacks of benjamins. Adonis had it, and I think it's good for a younger audience to see that even thought you have what people would assume a successful person would have, he had it all except the most important thing, happiness. It took courage to get out of his life to go do something that in its essence is crazy. He gave up everything to pursue what ignited his soul and at the end it all paid off, not with just the experience of fighting the number one fighter of the world but also finding another thing that makes us all happy, love.

One of the best scenes not only in the movie, but any movie this year.  ", "The last fight, When Adonis says \"to prove I'm not a mistake\" \n\nThat line KILLED me. It was so perfect. It felt like we were all waiting for that line, but didn't even know we were waiting for it until he said it. Just a perfect line. \n\nWhat a great movie. ", "Saw this film Tuesday night, and I did comment on a Stallone post on this sub a bit about both MBJ's and Sly's performances, so I won't go into that too much.\n\nWhat I did think was amazing about this film though was the overwhelming similarities it had with the first Rocky but how different in tone and pacing it was. Rocky is a slow, slow, slowwwww burn of a film. It truly is. I think Creed has maybe 3 training montages in it? The pace of the film is much faster, but that isn't a bad thing. I think it helps give the movie its own identity.\n\nAnother aspect of this film that makes it so that it isn't just a cheap imitation of the first Rocky is that Adonis is such a different character in a few ways compared to Rocky. Rocky did talk a lot, true, especially around Adrian, but he did so in a way to make jokes and in a sort of self deprecating way. Rocky is a character who is very outwardly... pessimistic I guess would be the word, about himself. He doesn't have confidence and builds it throughout the film.\n\nAdonis on the other hand is very confident, cocky to a point and has a chip on his shoulder. He's very outwardly confident in himself, but at the same time it kinda comes out that he's kinda putting up an act and does have his doubts about himself living up to the Creed name.\n\nSo, Rocky and Adonis can connect on that level but still be different enough so that it doesn't feel like they were just going through the motions.\n\nAlso, from a technical standpoint this film is just a joy to watch. The first 2 fights of this film are shot as if they're one take (obviously they weren't but you know). Although, I think there might have been 1 cut in the first fight? I can't quite remember. But the 2nd fight was one of the best boxing scenes I've ever seen. I was captivated the entire time watching it.\n\nSome more minor things:\n\nPretty much everyone does a good acting job in this film (save for B. Jordan and Sly who are nothing short of amazing). Tessa Thompson as Bianca was really good as was Phylicia Rashad as Apollo's widow.\n\nThe music was fantastic as well. Hard to fail with a soundtrack that has The Roots, Nas, and 2Pac though.\n\nIf there was one thing that bothered me a bit and the main reason why I would rank this one slightly below the original Rocky as a film is that the \"bad guy\" (aka the main boxer at the end) seemed a bit underdeveloped compared to Apollo in the first film.\n\nYou really feel like you know Apollo in that first movie, where his head as at, where his motivations are, etc.\n\n(Slight spoilers ahead)\n\nWith the light heavyweight champ, \"Pretty\" Ricky Conlan we really only get 2 bits of info: He is a hothead who punches his initial opponent during the press conference and he's going to jail for gun possession in Britain. That's kinda it... the rest is just that he's a dick. And not a \"fun\" dick like Apollo was, just kind of an asshole until the end.\n\nBut that's the only real problem I have with this film.\n\nEDIT: Oh and not like he needs the attention as I'm sure after this & Fruitvale Station he'll be getting plenty of offers, but of course Ryan Coogler's directing is superb. I'm really, really excited for what he has lined up next!!!", "I truly loved the subtle nods to the original. The best example of this was the final scene where they climb the museum steps together - not to train, but to overcome Rocky's illness.\n\nAlso, I teared up when Adonis' motivations are revealed in the final round, \"I have to prove that I'm not a mistake.\" The line felt so real and heartbreaking.

And I absolutely loved the original score and soundtrack.", "What can I say, a true love letter to the Rocky franchise, harkens back to the original film, with the story revolving less around the big fight, but more around the characters and the relationships, particularly the father-son relationship Adonis and Rocky cultivate. This film was excellent in my opinion. What did I like?\n\nFirst, the character of Adonis. I felt Adonis was amazing and Michael B. Jordan was great in the role. I saw this movie with my best friend, an avid Rocky fan himself, and we were surprised to see that Jordan does in fact somewhat resemble Carl Weathers. I was glad to see that Adonis wasn't stereotypical, rather than the usual young black man raised by the streets and whatnot you get in most films, Adonis is already living comfortably with a good job when he's introduced as an adult, with the shabby apartment from the trailers coming from a move to Philly. I also like how they didn't do the typical \"Bastard son hates the father\" trope you see either, Adonis refuses the name of Creed not out of hatred for Apollo, but in fear of dishonoring the name, as well as the hope of being his own man, rather than his father's shadow. \n\nThe supporting cast was also great, Stallone brought that old Rocky charm we all love, now playing the lovable old mentor. Rocky himself also manages to defy tropes, when, instead of the bitter old cynic we'd expect, we see a man, sad, yet, stable, having grown to accept the loss of his loved ones and living life as best he could. Rather than being a cold curmudgeon, Rocky stands by Adonis as support and a friend, endlessly understanding. \n\nI also loved Bianca, played by Tessa Thompson, yet another character that defies stereotypes, rather than the angry black woman we've come to expect, Bianca is an understanding, yet stern, love interest for Adonis. She is supportive of him to the end and manages to be a three dimensional character, rather than flat eye-candy. \n\nIf any character was somewhat flat, I'd say Ricky Conlan, played by Tony Bellow, but, what we do see of him shows a complex character, fighting not for fame or glory, but to support his family, and ultimately being a good sport upon winning the final match, congratulating Adonis and telling him that he is the future of boxing. \n\nAll in all, this film was excellent, and, in my humble opinion, May breath new life into the Rocky franchise.", "As some one who has never seen any Rocky films, is this film still a good watch?", "[that epic last round soundtrack](https://youtu.be/1uOoNa5OwiU)\n", "The cloud joke was the funniest joke in this movie imo", "Pretty Rickys entrance scene was sick as fuck ", "This is a really great movie. The only gripe I have with it was it felt a bit rushed, especially in the beginning. The beginning just felt more like snippets of scenes that should've been expanded on. I don't typically want to compare even though it's a part of the series, but I feel like the previous Rocky movies did a good job of expanding on the subplots and kept a good pace. With the first 2 films effectively tracking the timeline of Rocky, his relationship with Adrian and even his opponent at an effective pace. \n\nOther than that one gripe, I loved this film. My three favorite moments were the gym encounter between Adonis and Danny \"Stuntman\" Wheeler. The dude looked like a legit badass with little to no role in the film. The other two were the jail cell scene with Rocky and a tie between the cemetary scene and the actual championship bout. Stallone was my favorite performance in the film.\n\nEdit: Me and my buddies were dying of laughter coming up with an awful and lame cashcow Creed franchise.\n\nCreed 2 - vs. Robo Ivan Drago\n\n\nCreed 3 - vs. The rapper he punched at the concert\n\n\nCreed 4 - vs. Zombie Apollo\n\n\nCreed 5 - Rocky finds the fountain of youth and challenges Adonis", "Swole as", "Wow.

Half the audience in my showing was cheering and fist pumping in their seats in reaction to every punch. It was like they were there at the fights. ", "Here are a few thoughts from a die-hard Rocky fan:\n\n* What is great about both this and Rocky Balboa is that they both found the most plausible way to present an implausible plot. In Rocky Balboa, it's ridiculous to think that a 55 year old boxer would have any kind of chance against a 30 year old World Heavyweight Champion, but right in the second round, the guy breaks his hand. Suddenly it's a level playing field. In Creed, it's absurd to think that a young kid with only 1 officially sanctioned fight under his belt would get a shot at the champion, but they play up how the champ is headed to jail, needs one last huge payday, and how they will only give him the match if he uses Creed as his name anyway. Really smart storytelling in both movies that could have been embarrassing if done incorrectly.\n\n* Stallone seals the Oscar nomination with the \"when I break\" speech in the locker room.\n\n* When the re-mixed Rocky theme FINALLY kicks in full blast at the last round, holy shit, here come the chills.\n\n* I give the film a ton of credit, because when you're making a film in the Rocky franchise, it can be so easy to fall on crutches, and this avoids ALL of them except for the final round. No first-he-sucks-now-he's-a-little-better-now-\"you're-gonna-kill-him!\" training montage with Gonna Fly Now. No raw eggs. No Conlan dropping his shoulders just like Apollo Creed once Adonis gets knocked down hard.

But I was seriously welling up in this movie. Stallone brought me to tears a couple times, and the scene where Michael B. Jordan running in he streets with the bikes really got to me. I was also surprised that Donnie didnt win at the end, but i thought it worked really well. I got goosebumps and emotional as well when Phylicia Rashad sent him the Creed trunks and the letter saying be your own person or whatever. Tessa Thompson is  great actress and should be more stuff.

Performances across the board were great.  Also some top-notch cinematography.  The fights are so well shot, in particular the two that were extended takes.   I also love the sense of place in this movie, Philadelphia just felt so real and gritty,  clearly made by people who understand the area past and present.  I have to say I got teary-eyed quite a few times, as someone who absolutely loves the first movie and enjoys the rest (minus 5), this film really hit home.  Also I wanted to note on an interesting parallel between creed and his love interest, Bianca.  She at one point mentions the due to her hearing loss she will continue to do what she loves until she can't anymore, A theme also shared with Rocky himself.  Well this goes deeper as it can also be connected to boxing and sports in general.  Anyone can only Play a sport, or fight in this case, as long as their body lets them.  The idea of father time permeates this movie, how it has an effect on us physically, mentally, and emotionally, and how things from your past define your future whether you like it or not. We must embrace our heritage and our past while paving a new way. \n\nGreat flick 9.5/10", "I had pretty high expectations, and this exceeded them. As everybody's already said, Stallone's performance and the one-shot fight were awesome. I love how the big fan service follows Adonis' arc. He only does the running and gets the shorts once the fact that he's Creed's son gets out. \"Gonna Fly Now\" and the Rocky Steps only come in once he's proven himself.", "Stallone reminds people he is more than just Rocky & Rambo. Creed is easily one of the best movies of the year. ", "Good movie. I agree that Conlan was underdeveloped as a character, but the movie was more about Creed and Rocky, which is probably why they also glossed over the announcement of the winner. Similar to the first Rocky where they wanted to prove something to themselves, rather than have a huge focus on winning the belt. I loved the effort they put in to create hype for the final fight with those elaborate entrances, etc. As well as the direction and camera angles really helped make it feel like a big fight.\n\nI also loved the scene where Adonis guessed how many fingers the doctor was holding up before the final round. His eye was messed up, I was waiting for him to start shouting for Stich to cut him.\n\n", "This is the best movie of 2015 so far. Everything about this film is absolutely fantastic. Loved every minute of it. I have never seen a Rocky film, but my father has. He holds the first Rocky movie very dear to his heart. I took him with me to see this movie. . . And it's by far is favorite Rocky movie. Go see it, period.  ", "Holy shit the fight cinematography. Throughout that fight against Leo in one take I couldn't stop grinning like an idiot.", "Saw it today.  Just a wonderful film and a worthy entry into the Rocky legacy.  The acting from the leads were really great, with a particular nod to Sly.  While MJ was really great, I couldn't help but be mesmerized whenever Rocky was on the screen.  I think he gave some of his best stuff here in a role that has been so iconic for him over the many years, just impressive.  Man, that line where they're talking about his cancer and he was saying that if he could put all those good memories and feelings in a bowl and have just one more day with his wife, but he can't...really moving stuff.\n\nThe film really felt alive and it picked right up in the Rocky universe without skipping a beat.  If they end the franchise here, they will have done it proud.  If they come up with some more movies of this caliber, I'd happily go see them.", "::looks up:: \"Wh-what cloud?\"", "I thought it was funny that the name he was using instead of Adonis Creed, he was going by the name Don Johnson.", "The only thing I don't quite understand about the movie, is why they kept referring to Apollo as the greatest boxer in history? Wasn't Rocky's accomplishments more impressive? ", "Can I just point out that the stats of the fighters on screen every time a new one entered the fight was incredibly cheesy and video-game-like, but it was one of the things I loved most about the movie? ", "Those final fight entrances felt like I was watching a PPV WWE fight. Amazing.", "Creed. \n\nI'm at a loss of words for this movie. \nExcellent writing, cinematography and original score. It has just the right amount of callbacks to the older films to be a Rocky sequel, but not too many. This isn't just another Rocky film, this is a film that can, and will, stand on its own. I expect full Oscar nominations for this movie, especially for Stallone, who shows his full acting chops here. \n\nThis is without a doubt in my mind the current undisputed king of the year, I like it as much as, possibly more than Mad Max: Fury Road. \n\n9.5 out of 10", "Really enjoyed Creed. It feels kind of like a remake because it hits almost all the same plot points that Rocky did but it is done so well that I did not mind. The cast was great and I love how Coogler handled the fight scenes. It put you right in it without using the Raging Bull POV style. I also like how it flipped the Rocky theme of proving you are worth something into identity. Trying to carve a name of your own when you are in the shadow of greatness, even if you have no connection to that greatness. Rocky has always been someone that needed people so to me it worked that Adonis gave him something to fight for as well.                \n\nSome superficial things I really liked was the fight cards that would pop up when a new fighter was introduced. The bikers riding along Creed as he trained, Conlan's intro was so dope too.             \n\nMy favorite part of course was the final round. Rocky's speech about how he never thanked Apollo for being there so now he wanted to thank Adonis for doing the same. \"I love ya kid now go kick his ass\" then the Rocky theme hits. It is completely earned unlike the cheap way the score was used in Jurassic World. Give it a solid 8. Just a fun movie. ", "In my opinion, the last scene of rocky climbing the steps with Donnie rivals the last scene of the original rocky, \"Adrian!\" yells and all. When he made it to the top of the stairs, there were tears rolling down my cheeks. Incredible film, my favorite of the year so far. (Fingers crossed for Episode VII.) ", "The real time one-shot fight scene was insane.  I loved it.  \n\nIt was shot so tightly you could feel it, like you were in there with him.  Once inside, you truly feel just how fast three minutes is, plus the one minute rest break that barely lasts a second.  He was trying to get technical advice from Rocky, and \"HEY SECONDS OUT\" before they could really strategize.  Perfect.  ", "This movie was amazing.  It had me all teary-eyed in some scenes and pumped up in others.  Michael B Jordan was perfect in this movie and so was Stallone.

Robin (rockys son who 'fled to Canada for violent crimes) visits cancerous father with pregnant girlfriend from Vancouver. He's jealous of Creed being like a son to Rocky.

Creed and Robin fight, Creed wins.  After making up, Robins gangster friends become Creeds friends, Movie ends with Robin going to jail for murder (what he fled for). \n\nCreed 3. Creeds wife pregnant.  They adopted Robins son.  Robin gets killed in jail by suspicious russian inmate. Creed opens note from Rocky after death of Robin. It says there's a fighter in Russia that was biologically engineered (cloned + enhanced) using Drago's DNA after Creed's dads' fight - so the kid is same age as Creed and technically drago's son/clone.  Creed looks in to it, and turns out this crazy Russian kid is plowing everyone.  The same secret Russian company that was steroiding drago also created the hybrid clone, has been doing bad things, including human engineering, and had killed a couple people that knew of what they were doing, including Robin. But no one can prove it, so Creed goes to Russia with Robins gangster friends. They get information about the company and escape back to USA. Russians abduct both Creed's pregnant wife and his dad's wife and threaten to kill if Creed doesn't fight drago's son. Creed fights and kills the engineered clone son of Drago with a knockout.

To be continued", "I have never seen a Rocky movie before. I don't give a shit about boxing. I fucking LOVED every second of this movie. The performances were Oscar worthy, the script was sharp, the directing was captivating. It also did something really great for a franchise film. It allowed you to actually care about the characters on the strength of this film, not having to rely on a previous attachment to the characters to get you to care. This movie well and truly earns every emotional beat and left me in tears. The best cinematic experience I've had all year. ", "I watched as a person that has never rewatch a rocky movie, I loved it. I knew a little bit about the characters, and the song, but that's it. \n\nI  didn't expect the movie to be funny, but it was very funny surprisingly\n\nI especially liked the (SPOILERS) bit at the end in the second or third round where creed gets his first big hits in and they're just ragging on each other\n", "Rocky is such a loveable character.

Fantastic. 47 year old here who has seen all of the Rocky movies (that'd be I, II, III, IV, and \"Balboa\") many times over. \n\nIt's a solid next installment in the franchise. As many reviewers have said... it's respectful to the source material, while still managing to carve out its own identity.\n\nQuick question.. there was a quote that Rocky made to Adonis. It was about how when you're fighting, you're only fighting yourself. Your opponent is just in the way. Does anybody remember that quote as it was said?", "Damn I loved it! I live in Philadelphia and I love the original Rocky movies, but I always felt they capture a different time in Philadelphia that I can't completely connect to. This movie touched on the old Philadelphia like in Rocky, but embraced what the city is today like the original Rocky movies did. From the kids on dirt bikes, going to Johnny Brendas, to training under the El. It captures what the city is now very well. I could have done without the \"jawn\" scene though, because that came across like it was trying too hard. \n\nThe first fight had some awesome cinematography, and I loved that it was all one shot. The music in this was great too, and the payoff when they finally played the Rocky scene was great. I might go see it a second time.", "Expected it to be so bad it was good. Instead it was just superb. Genuinely moving, realistic characters, only a few absurd cartoony bits, and who knew Andre Ward and Tony Bellew can act?\n\nTessa Thompson is my new crush, and I'm really pleased that Wallace is ok.", "HOLY SHIT! THis film should get nominated for best sound mixing. The crowd chanting during Creed's entrance at the final fight sounded so authentic, felt like I was actually there!", "Great movie. I was skeptical and not really sold based on the trailer. But the reviews were great...so I went. It's good. Totally captures some kind magic and drama that the first movie had. Also - the opponents were scary. Every time he fought I had that oh shit feeling. ", "Pretty Ricky Conlin is acted by Tony Bellew, a professional boxer who's last loss came at the hands of a guy named Adonis Stevenson", "Loved it. I got chills a few times.\n\nDefinitely the best-filmed boxing of the entire series. That second fight with a tracking shot was really impressive.\n\nI would have liked to see, or at least hear about, Rocky talking to his son after his diagnosis. Did he never tell him? Did Rob not notice him looking sick on TV?\n\nI was a little disappointed in the opposing fighter's name. \"Pretty\" Jimmy Conlan or something like that? Not memorable. C'mon, this is the franchise that gave us Ivan Drago, Clubber Lang, Apollo Creed. Hell, the first guy Rocky fought was Spider Rico...now that's a fighter's name! Conlan isn't even the level of Tommy Gunn or Mason \"The Line\" Dixon.\n\nI though the love interest was alright, though I found myself wondering if that part had originally been intended for an actual singer to do, like Beyonce. There was a Barbershop 3 trailer before the movie, so I found myself wondering if Nicki Minaj could have pulled it off.\n\nStallone has well deserved Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor. It's often forgotten that was nominated for a Lead Actor Oscar for the original Rocky.  If Stallone actually wins an Oscar for playing Rocky, I imagine his acceptance speech will set a world record for grown men crying simultaneously. \n\nMichael B. Jordan should be thrilled that this, and not Fant4stic, will be the main movie that he's known for this year. ", "The running through the street homage scene gave me goosebumps. I love how they incorporated the rocky statue as well. The movie was a perfect love letter to the originals without being a straight copy of them. Easily one of my favorites this year.", "My friends and I were joking about a teaser for Creed II and it goes something like this.\n\nThere's a fight going on between two boxers in a ring but you only hear sounds and see their feet. Suddenly one drops to the floor. It's Pretty Ricky Conlan! The camera pans up and shows: Ivan Drago, unaged since Rocky IV due to his superior genetics and cyborg therapy. He is holding a list of some of the best boxers in the world and is crosses out Conlan. The next one is Adonis. The Soviet National Anthem plays in the background.

I mean compare him to other Rocky opponents like Apollo, Mr. T, and Drago...", "Cinematography was absolutely amazing. It was easily my favorite aspect of the movie. It felt like I was playing Fight Night, and I wouldnt doubt it if they took some cinematic cues from the game. The walk-throughs before each fight where you follow Creed from the locker room to the ring was just wow. Again, very Fight Night-ish. Then add the on screen visual of the fighter's record and credentials...\n\nThe actual fight scenes were great, probably the best ever done for a boxing movie. \n\nI thought there were some cheesy parts. Training in the hospital and the motorcycle charge to Rockys apartment were a little over the top for me, but it's a Rocky movie I suppose. \n\nOverall solid movie. 8/10 would watch again and recommend.

", "Just watched this last night. I'd heard it was good obviously and heard Sly was good too, but I couldn't believe what I was watching. Not only was the best film I'd seen in a long time, but it just kept getting better and better.\n\n\n\n\nStallone took a massive risk this one. You always hear about certain films he has got the script for, he tears it up and rewrites it to make it 'more Stallone'. With Creed, he handed the character over to Coogler and trusted him with it. He made himself vulnerable in a way I've never seen from him before (even more so than Copland).\n\n\n Even with the absolutely fantastic script and story, it means nothing if the actors don't bring it and Sly certainly brought it. I genuinely can't remember a better performance in a film, which is something I'd never thought I'd say about Sly. Yes, Mark Rylance did a fantastic job in Bridge of Spies, but for me it's no where near the level of Stallone in Creed, robbed of the Oscar.\n\n\n\nEveryone else was great too. Perfectly casted, perfectly acted, perfection. Easily one of my favourite films I've ever seen", "Was about to cry but realized that I was with my SO. This movie was worth the wait and I'm probably going to see it a few more times. ", "The part where he jogs and gets encircled by motorbikes was weird as hell.

It was just like any other rocky movie.\nFelt rocky getting cancer was a bit clich\u00e9d, but they handled it superbly. Overall the film drew parallels with the first and second rocky with creed's career and emotional journey. \nThe fights were brilliantly shit and choreographed. He really took bloody good punches.\nThe training montage music was catchy but I just kept humming gonna fly now.\nThe moment with the original music in the last round, opened up the tao for waterworks. Hoped for yo bianca/rocky, I did it!\nWept with nostalgic joy and satisfaction of a great film.\nSly better get an Oscar consideration for supporting role.", "People were getting into both of those fights at the theatre I was in. I was so amped, I saw people fucking shadowboxing in the theatre lol. Great experience to see in a full show.", "There were a lot of scenes that stood out to me but my personal favorite was the dirt bike scene. That scream to the cut of the music with just Jhene Aiko singing gave me chills. Also the soundtrack was amazing. Finally in the last fight when Donnie cut Conlan...it instantly reminded me of the infamous Rocky 4 \"He's cut\" and I got super hype. \n\nEDIT: Can't forget the \"Not a mistake\" pre 12th round speech and then Conlan's only knockdown in the 12th. I can see Conlan/Donnie being the next Rocky/Apollo team. I can't remember who the Number 2 fighter was who fucked up Donnie in the gym but he needs to be the next villian in Creed 2.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm a HUGE fan of PTI so seeing Kornheiser and Wilbon debate about Creed had me so giddy.", "The fight scenes were directed so well.

Phenomenal.", "Directed, filmed, and acted amazingly... I am a huge fan of the original Rocky movies (except 5 of course) and i teared up a few times... also I am a born and raised Philadelphian resident so it hit me really hard... the scenes of philly got me goin, and the run up 9th st through the italian market with the kids on the bikes got me really fired up.", "Quite possibly one of the best films in the past few years. This not only lives up to the hype and expectations set out by previous Rocky films, but it stands on its own two feet in a universe that's 3-4 decades old. Great contribution to the franchise. Michael B Jordan needed this win - after the failure of Fantastic Four especially. He's got a lot of talent, heart, and charm and it's been wasted on shitty films.\n\nThe opening sequence? Fantastic. Chills.\n\nThe directing of the first fight scene? Amazing. You don't see anyone but Creed and his opponent, but the quick camera action worked extremely well.\n\nThe best part: the story. Loved the fact that the biggest antagonist was Creed himself. It wasn't Wheeler, or Conlan; it was forgiving his father and accepting his name. The movie didn't rely on a cheesy win by the protagonist or anything, but coming to an understanding. Far better than what I was expecting.\n\nSoundtrack was phenemonal - but such a shame they didn't play \"Last Breath\" by Future - so many opporuntiies to use it, but loved how they used the Rocky theem throuhgout the film. ", "- The \"it's kind of a secret\" line when Adonis asked about the third Apollo/Rocky fight was a hysterical reference to the Rocky 3 freeze frame ending.\n- Still finding words to explain the single-shot fight scene. I could have watched that for another hour.\n- Sly's acting was top top notch. The way he fought back tears in the scenes following his prognosis were incredibly real. The jail scene with Adonis is the new Good Will Hunting \"it's not your fault\" scene. I do agree it would have been good to do at least one more shot at Adrian's grave at some point. \n- I can count on one hand how many scenes drew me in as much as the the flashback moment when it looked like he was going to get knocked out. You could feel every conceivable emotion in that moment.\n- The motorcycle training scene? HYYYYPE!\n- Two random picky things, both music related 1 - It would have been incredible if Adonis walked out to Bianca's music. I understand her music wasnt much made for a boxing intro and doing so would have had to add more story line, though. Perhaps in the future? 2 - The Rocky theme should have been more prominent in the final scene. When it broke into the classic chorus moment at the end of the fight they drew the volume down for the scene and I feel they lost what would have been an amazing emotional crescendo. Picky as hell, but just glib reaction.\n\nI am hoping this leads to this sort of becoming a sister series to Rocky. The Rocky series alongside the Creed series. They reinvigorated this level of story for this generation and I am shocked at how well they pulled it off. ", "I know I'll get shit but I think this is my favorite sports movie ever!

A \"talk\" between Rocky and the guy who was running Mick's... the guy who obviously outed Adonis as a Creed. I was disappointed to not see any followup there. I'm sure it would have made for some good drama.  \n\n2. Some sort of interaction between Marianne (Apollo's widow) and Rocky. Clearly, she knew that Rocky was training Adonis. Does she blame Rocky for Apollo's death (for not throwing in the towel)? A phone call or something... but boy, can you imagine if she'd shown up in Philly and slapped Rocky in the face or something? That scene would have been intense. \n\nJust seemed like a couple of opportunities for some really good dramatic scenes that were completely lost :( ", "The soundtrack for this film was so good", "I have watched this movie 10 times and cried every single one of them. I find myself routing for adonis in the last fight even though I know what is going to happen. This movie is incredibly good, one of the best I have ever watched.", "I teared up.   Several times.  And I'm a guy .   Anyone else?", "Saw it as my annual \"Thanksgiving Movie\" and I am soooo happy that I did! First, I have to admit that I am not a Rocky fan. Not because I saw them and didn't enjoy them, just because I haven't seen them all. I vaguely recall watching the first film, but I was pretty young and most of the plot didn't interest me at the time. So my perspective is as someone who 1) isn't a huge Rocky fan but 2) similarly, doesn't know much about the Rocky universe. \n\n**Positives/Strengths**: \n\n1) This could have been a super cliche film, but I *really* think they avoided that label! The plot was fun, fresh, and always progressing. From the backstory of Adonis, the introduction of Bianca, the relationship between Rocky-Adonis, the relationship between Adonis and his adoptive mother, *and* Adonis' motivation of just not wanting to be a mistake (cue waterworks)--so many things were just done well.  \n\n2) There wasn't ever a moment where the story stalled out--it just kept pressing on with more and more energy. Plus, the ending could not have been more satisfying for me. It was a great end to an already solid story. There really were not \"cheap shots,\" and I think we just saw the birth of another solid character in the Rocky franchise. \n\n3) Another strength is cinematography of the fight scenes! They were shot soooo well! Combine it with (what I thought) was a pretty damn good soundtrack, they were just so satisfying to watch. I too had people cheering in the audience during the last fight, and it just felt right. \n\n4) And the final BIG strength I felt they delivered on was Bianca as a character. An experimental-alternative musician that has progressive deafness??? I know this may annoy some people for me to highlight, but do you know how rare it is for movies to positively portray individuals *with* disabilities *without* the heavy doses of melodrama surrounding the condition??? Oh, and the character *is also a person of color*?!? It just doesn't happen, and it happened in a fucking boxing movie!!! :D And you know what the best thing was? It just felt natural. \n\n**Cons**: \n\n1) I really wanted a little more Bianca. The *one* cliche they did kinda indulge was how they introduced Bianca. The ol' \"it's okay for her to be a horrible neighbor because she's pretty\" trick. There was a bit too sudden of a shift from \"inconsiderate neighbor who is playing her music too loud\" to \"girl Adonis is totally cool with\" for my tastes, but I think the hilarious \"good luck bro\" line from the random dude on the stairs helped salvage that lame shift. \n\n2) Very little insight to the background of any of the opponents Adonis faced. Given what they had to accomplish in the film, I think that can be forgiven, but from what I understand of the franchise--this is a pretty big departure from the old Rocky films. \n\n\n**Overall**: I'd definitely give this a solid 8.5/10. I was entertained throughout, it was beautifully shot, and the three main actors were fabulous. I just hope we get to see more of Adonis!!! ", "What a badass movie. If they make a sequel(s), then I hope that Adonis slowly grows into a major loudmouth shit talker, like Apollo. It'd be a fun way to further differentiate the character from the quiet and humble Rocky. ", "God damn that was an amazing movie. It had just enough nostalgia without it outshining what was a great story about a man troubled with his legacy. Michael B. Jordan is legit.

As for Sylvester Stallone, I personally think that he had one of his best dramatic performances of his career and in the Rocky series in general. I think that he is worthy of an oscar nomination for best supporting actor.  I only thing I was disappointed about was the rival Ricky Connely. I wasn't really disappointed, the actor who played him was very good, it is just that he wasn't as memorable as Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, or my favorite Ivan Drago. I'm not gonna spoil the final fight but the audience and I felt like we were at the arena.

I think they missed an opportunity to have Rocky go back to the graveyard to talk to Adrian after he found out he had cancer. Or maybe they did think about or maybe even possibly filmed a scene but dropped it because they thought it took away from the flow? I could hear people around me crying in a couple scenes. Imagine the tears flowing if he did go back.", "I held it together for the whole goddamn movie, and then that epilogue on the steps happened. Sniff. ", "Loved the movie. Saw it last night with my husband. There were a lot of excellent moments in the film.\n\nAnd I really want to see the actor that played Conlan in more movies. The way he just *grinned* when Adonis tagged him with a jab intimidated me far more than his fight intro (although that was amazing in its own right).", "I saw this movie last night and was impressed.  Of course the story was highly romanticized but the acting was pretty good, and the film did very small, detailed things to invoke the original Rocky films which I could appreciate.  I loved the cuts to the early morning, cold steel that represents gritty Philadelphia that we saw in the first films.  It really makes you appreciate the hard work they put into training, nobody wants to be up that early!  Also loved the original soundtrack themes a bit modernized with edm beats.  This worked really well for me.  It seemed like they took many things that worked from the originals and just modernized them.  This was especially clear in the climatic run sequence in which Rocky would usually finish his training by galloping up the Philadelphia stairs.  Instead, Adonis runs through the same streets in the same grey hoodie, but ends by rallying the street bikers around him.  Very simple, cool touch.  ", "I don't really have anything much to add to the discussion, just want to say that I think it is a worthy addition to the Rocky franchise. I'm not certain if it is quite worthy of the 93% on RT, but it is still a great movie in my opinion.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was how out of shape Conlan looked in comparison to Creed.

The acting was completely solid all around, with particular kudos to Mark Ruffalo (and his outburst at the end). The editing was so tight - tension and score were both on point. \n\nI'm basically telling all my friends to watch this movie. It's just drama well done.

With, I believe, the most perfectly balanced script. There were no bad acting notes. But I have to give special mention to Liev Schreiber, his understated performance was so great, he could have easily screwed up such a straight-forward role like his (as many often do) but he played it so earnestly, it was refreshing.\n\nI've also read other critiques in this thread, and I can't say I disagree with many of them. Someone said it seemed more like a HBO movie. Someone else said it'd work better as a documentary. The film really is presented very matter-of-fact. \n\nHowever, what most astounded me is that this film was primarily and almost exclusively, an investigative journalism story; you have to remember the original subject matter. With such a heavy (and by-God is it heavy) underlying subject, to be as subdued as well as it was throughout, is masterful. This could have easily fallen off the rails as melodramatic, but you really feel the emotional payoffs in the third act. (Rezendes leaving Garabedian's office, Robby & Rezendes walking into Spotlight the morning the story broke, and the coda) Also, the way this story was shot and told, managed to create a visual love letter to Boston. You can feel the city itself be a character. Setting is crucial to the story, and you also feel the city itself changing throughout. \n\nThe film is great no doubt about it. *How great* is up to the individual. As for myself, it resets the bar for what an investigative journalism drama should be. It checks absolutely every box. Unforgettable? Definitely. Legendary? Maybe just shy. 9/10 for me", "Favorite scene was the one where Keaton's character has the sit down with the BC High School guys and he asks the one dude what sport he played in high school. Really reinforced how haphazard this whole life traumatizing experience could be. ", "Just got out of the film. It's a 2+ hour pure journalism movie with no action scenes to speak of, but the time flew by. I had actually forgot about the opening scene, now that I think of it, it was very odd.\n\nWhile it's a movie I probably won't watch again, it's definitely a movie that warrants repeated viewings to keep all the names straight. I appreciated the fact that the reporters used their lingo and the movie doesn't hold the audiences hand, or wait for you to catch up. While I would sometimes lose track of who was who, I never felt like I missed anything.\n\nI liked how all the characters accepted some degree of blame, and acknowledged that in reality, it's difficult to uncover these things. In a movie as heavy-handed as this, it would've been easy to show the journalists as the blameless crusaders taking on the corrupt lawyers, cops, and priests. Some parties share more of the guilt than the others, but I was glad the film avoided the good guys vs. bad guys feel.\n\nI think one of the most profound scenes was when Sacha confronted one of the former priests at his house. A lot of films that feature a child molester usually play them up to be as creepy as possible, but this priest being so matter-of-fact about it, and being so quick to admit that similar things had been done to him really made you grasp the depth of the problem. \n\nAnd on a lighter note, I'm glad the traditional Boston accent was toned down. It seems like whenever a movie is set in Boston the entire cast doubles-down on their thickest Boston accent, so much so that it borders on parody.", "Saw this movie last night, and I really thought it was a masterclass in subtlety. The subject matter was much more powerful because the movie didn't pull any big stunts in cinematography, music or performances. The people in the movie feel real, and that enforces the whole message.\n\nGreat film.", "The ONLY negative thing I can say about the movie is when Stanley Tucci says there are no Armenians in Boston. There's a large Armenian population in Watertown and in Boston in general. BUT this is seriously the best film I've seen all year. A+", "I just saw this movie this afternoon and man, what a great movie. It was riveting and the cast was just excellent. While most people will probably be all about Mark Ruffalo's performance, and with good reason because it was excellent, I think my favorite performance was Michael Keaton. It's not a big flashy role but he was just amazing as Walter \"Robby\" Robinson. He was the glue in that cast.", "Was I the only person who thought/felt that Ruffalos character was one of the victims too? The way that he was more engaged the whole investigation than everyone else. The way he looked at those kids in the end at the church. I felt they were trying too convey that he was one of the victims but couldn't bring himself to admit it. Especially when he was explaining why he left the church when he was younger. ", "Brilliant film. 10/10. Terrific ensemble cast with amazing performances all around, especially by Keaton and Ruffalo. Fantastic job by Tom McCarthy, who wrote a fantastic, powerful script.\n\nAs a side note, I found the journalistic work fascinating. I work for a broadcast news network, and I couldn't stop noticing the stark contrasts of how the job was done 15 years ago and how it's done today. I mean, the advantages that we have today (computers, cell phones, SOCIAL MEDIA) make our job so much easier than it used to be. I know the movie showed how hard they worked, and how dedicated they were to the story, but I cannot understate just how hard they must have worked on this story. Countless hours of painstakingly tedious work poring over thousands of pages, knocking on hundreds of doors, etc. Really remarkable, inspiring work by these guys.", "Isn't nice when the current frontrunner for Best Picture is a film you'd actually want to see win? This phenomenal film from Tom McCarthy is more than just another example of how the director is one of the best working (well when he's not making a film with Adam Sandler at least) and a testament to an incredible news team, but a reminder that individual people can sometimes be more influential than even the biggest systems. This film respects it's audience. It never panders, never overstates, never bludgeons you over the head with obvious symbolism, and most importantly it always remembers that what matters most isn't the acclaim, it's the story and it's the victims. Two of the films best moments come at the end. When you are expecting this big celebratory moment, both times the characters remember that the job for those who defend the victims and expose the truth is never over. \n\nSeriously, a phenomenal film that deserves the many accolades it will receive.", "Fortunately, I was able to see this film early through my university, with a Q&A with Robby Robinson immediately afterwards. I've been a huge fan of McCarthy's other work (haven't seen the Cobbler), and I wasn't disappointed by this film.\n\nThe Q&A session afterwards not only helped me better appreciate the true story, but also the skill that went into the acting and writing of the film's characters. I was absolutely shocked at how well Michael Keaton captured Robinson's mannerisms and speech. It was as if the character had leapt right off the screen and begun answering our questions.\n\nAll in all, one of my favorite movies of the year. Great performances, smart direction, and one hell of a script. On a more personal note, as a practicing Catholic, this film's subject matter meant a lot to me as well. I think it was handled in a very real and honest way, and McCarthy didn't hold back in depicting the horror of these abuses. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.", "Just watched it last night.  Only a few movies sit with you until the next day, this was one of them.  The list at the end was absolutely haunting.  ", "Top notch cast and directing. Especially mark ruffalo was great. I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. I don't know how historically accurate the movie was but it was a really dark and sad story.", "Saw this with my non-Massachusetts native wife a few weeks ago (I grew up here); she went into the movie knowing the broadstrokes but was completely taken aback by the size of the scandal.  Those end credits/list of cities really takes your breath away", "As my husband described it: \"that was an unpleasantly well done movie.\"", "Having been in junior high when the timeline of this movie was happening, I can say it was extremely sad but educational to watch. I had no idea what was truly going on or how serious this issue was and still is- the movie was incredibly captivating. Wonderful performances by all the actors. I heard Mark Ruffalo studied his role so much that the real Michael was so impressed.\n\nThe last kicker of the film was during the credits when I saw my city listed. I am no longer naive to this but I was speechless. Really hit home. \n\n", "Excellent flick! It's that rare combination of story, direction, and acting where every aspects nails it to the top possible degree.\n\nMultiple standout performances. Mark Ruffalo has the most to display, and Michael Keaton delivers what I felt was a far stronger performance (and easily more understated) than Birdman, and off to the side is this brilliant, subtle Liev Schrieber role.\n\nThe pacing is perfect. Never lets up, but never rushes, and it doesn't stick around too long. \n\nIt'll be in the Best Picture race, for sure. Not sure if it will win, but man right now it's my favs pick.\n\n10/10", "While watching the movie I felt the death of investigative journalism as technology continues to stomp on print media and fast paced delivery of news prevents these long-term research groups prior to going to press.

I guess I'm gullible, but I was totally going for the portrayal of Bradlee being the one who was totally unenthusiastic about the investigation and was probably the one who buried the past investigations.  They were all culpable.....", "We must fight the downvoters!!\n\nBut seriously. Great film. I thought it was a great touch that just about every serious discussion about or with the victims in outside scenes had a church in the background of the shot. ", "Phenomenal film. I was aware to some extent about this story, but never knew how pervasive this was throughout the church. Very troubling, but I'm glad this kind of reporting exists to shine a light on stories people want kept in dark.

Perfection on so many levels. Tom McCarthy directs the film with the perfect amount of balance, as it straddles the line of thriller and drama. The film never loses focus, there's never any cheesy or silly subplot, this is simply all about the story at hand. The Church covering up for priests, and a team of 4 journalists digging to find out why. Mark Ruffalo gives an Oscar worthy performance, won't be surprised if we see him hoisting the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The rest of the cast was beautifully selected as Keaton follows up his Academy Award nomination from last year with another powerful performance leading the Spotlight team.\n\nRachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, and others round out a phenomenal ensemble. Spotlight is one of those films that tackles an uncomfortable topic, but does so in unwavering fashion. There is no pandering to the religious crowd, there is no easing up on the matter of separation of church and state. You're immersed in the process of these writers and their passion to uncover the truth.\n\nTo the skeptics of the Catholic Church and or religion, this film will only strengthen your stance. You'll question how it's even possible that people are brainwashed by an organization that claims to stand for Good and God, yet also conduct business like Tony Soprano and the mafia.\n\nExpect to see Spotlight in contention for Best Picture, along with Best Supporting Actor and possibly a Screenplay and Director award. A brilliant film on all fronts.", "Why is this entire thread getting downvoted?", "I just finished watching it tonight.  I wish I could adequately gather my thoughts but I am speechless at the moment, engrossed in reading more about this case. Absolutely fantastic film- 10/10", "This really was a riveting watch. Managed to stay completely engrossing throughout without much need for overly dramatic scenes, arguments or conflict. Script and dialogue were great, very natural. The acting, the people came across as real, the reporters came across as genuine in their work and intention with the cast appearing to go for authenticity instead of the false charisma/bravado you so often see in biographical films.\n\nI do love a grim subject, as bad as that sounds. \n\n", "Great film. *Perfectly* paced, until maybe the very end when there's no satisfaction; but that's intentional and the natural of real life. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack, and noticed during the credits it was by Howard Shore. It matched the tone of the movie perfectly. As a Bostonian, this film made me see my hometown in a new light, as less of a cosmopolitan city than a corrupt small town scaled up.\n\n\nOverall, a movie of balance: newsroom excitement, but not to the point of cliche; playing up the horror of what happened, but not to the point of being maudlin (for example, the journalists kept it professional at all times when interviewing people and working). Really hit the target all around.", "Super late to the party, but I kinda just want to get my opinions out.\n\nI *liked* the movie, but that's almost all I can say about it. Many people have been saying that it's a very subtle movie, and I agree. Unfortunately, it may just be *too* subtle. I don't really know what they could've done to fix this, but the whole time I was watching I didn't really feel anything. I've known about the scandal since it broke, and while I was just as disgusted with the people responsible, this movie didn't really do much to make me feel that again. The only exception is the scene where Ruffalo's character leaves Tucci's character's office and sees the kids about to be interviewed, realizing that this is still going on and it's not just these middle-aged guys in coffee shops telling stories from 20 years ago.\n\nI can't really speculate as to why the emotional response to this film is so strong, but I also can't help but feel that it's sort of a \"justice boner\" for lack of a better word. For the past 15 years, the Catholic Church has been paying for these horrible crimes, and I feel like a lot of people just really get gratification from seeing them get knocked down a peg. I'm not Catholic myself, so I don't want to seem like I'm trying to run interference on their behalf, I just can't really feel what everyone else is feeling about this movie.\n\nSo yeah, very well-crafted movie that did almost nothing for me. It's a film that does everything perfectly, it's jus that the sum of those parts isn't much for me", "I was surprised to learn John Slattery's character is the son of Jason Robard's character in All the President's Men. \n\nI really liked this movie, but not sure if it has rewatchability.", " Caught this last week. Excellent movie, best of the year thus far. Really is a rollercoaster of emotions. ", "Hey R/Movies! Had a pretty strong reaction to this one. Did a big write up. Pardon the more journal-y bits, this is part of a series I write somewhere else.\n\nNotes from Spotlight\n\n\nWe set off to watch Spotlight in our living room. We logged in on an Xbox One, my Xbox One, my \u201ccongrats on breaking up with your girlfriend\u201d gift from about a year ago.\n\nSpotlight is a story familiar to us, having all grown up in the Northeast. Half of us from Boston, it was nice to see the old familiar places. As a world, Spotlight pulls no punches and sprinkles no glamour. The people and city felt authentically mundane, everything from the awkward office jokes to the suburban paranoia was pitch perfect. The story meanders through bits that another Director might have punched up with suspense, but Spotlight makes a point of working through the tragedy of the victims of the church in a direct and thoughtful way. They conduct the details of decades worth of names and numbers to get the truth. At the same time, the film allows it\u2019s characters to be flawed and average, with crackles of brilliant when they work together. They drink Harpoon and eat great pizza. They get a job done.\n\nMy friends are like that too.\n\nNow, it wasn\u2019t even five minutes after the movie finished, and we\u2019re talking before the credits roll here, when the jokes started. The casual \u201csuck my dick\u201d impersonations of the Priests we had just watch get taken down in the film.\n\nTo set the stage further, we have four 25 year old men, watching a movie where a group of journalists (6 guys and 1 Rachel McAdams) take down the Boston Diocese of the Catholic Church (about 200-ish men).\n\nThree groups of people are in play- two of them are fictional movie factions based on real people, and one group is the very real audience watching the dramatized reality unfold. Concentric circles of judgement, working like this:\n\nAs so many things have, this starts with the Catholic Church. An organized religion, fearful of losing their priestly flock, places strict rules to suppress the sexual desires of their clergy. Then they ignore the consequences, out of agape, divine love. Some of the clergy, repressed and divinely ordained, abuse their power over the innocent. They let their eros bleed into their agape, and then everywhere else.\n\nThe journalists, some raised in the faith, slowly come to the truth after years of neglect. They don\u2019t bust the culprit, but stunningly bust the system. No love here, just duty. A few books get written, a movie gets made. Artists enamored with the gray logic of journalism, enchanted with the downfall of a system of power, well they get to making art. They love the parable.\n\nAn audience of yuppies watches this art, having lived through the chronicle of its inspiration. They all know a priest, they all know someone who\u2019s been effected. As most people do, they deal with sexual stigma through humor.\n\nThere is love across the circles, and yet the sharks of the sexual repression circle around them all.\n\n\u2013\n\nThe priest in my New Hampshire hometown was convicted of pedophilia. I wasn\u2019t too close with him, but he was always kind. He was kind in a Buddha way. No one saw it coming. After Spotlight, my thoughts swam to him, as I sat passively and let the language linger in the room. Keep in mind, we are all liberal minded generally nice folks\u2026who just occasional pretend to hump, molest, and verbally abuse each other. It\u2019s a method of ball-busting known by every group of guys I\u2019ve been a part of since college, and yet somehow it escapes the skewer or satire of popular culture.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m drawing too many circles around this. It\u2019s an unfair comparison really. A writer staying quiet while a bunch of guys mock pedophiles (and their own heterosexuality) is very different from a journalist ignoring documented child molestation. I believe that the pang of guilt is of the same breed, just at a different magnitude.\n\nI fear my sexuality, and I hate the language of rape and faux hetero-bravado through repressed homoeroticism that creeps into my friend groups. I\u2019ve repressed my discomfort so much that I puke out sentences like that. College educated, yet utterly unsure of itself.\n\nThis strange culture is in my video games, my living room, my cereal. I don\u2019t have an easy answer other than silence, observation, and yes- my participation.\n\nSpotlight doesn\u2019t let anyone be the hero with a solution, but allows the media to follow their own blistered rules of research. When the ugly truth rears its head and the Boston Globe asks itself why they didn\u2019t report on the allegations earlier, one journalist offers the excuse that they needed \u201cTeam Spotlight.\u201d They did not.\n\nIt\u2019s the same way I am quietly letting the language of abuse become part of my daily life, until the pressure is too great and I have no choice but to expose our hideousness to my friends. All the while taking on a victim role that I have no right to assume, while participating in the joke enough to be a part of the problem I can\u2019t stand.\n\nThe problem is best seen as a drunk snake sucking on its own tail, occasionally gagging, then letting up to remind everyone there are still fangs.\n\nAnother analogy to avoid the spotlight.\n", "Great movie all around.  Substance, good pacing, impeccable acting, and interesting characters.  We all know the topic matter but it unfolds in such a way where you feel like you are uncovering it again because the scope is a real slap in the face. The actors really portray the stress and anguish they must have felt covering up something so vile.  Realizing so many people around the fucking world were complicate in covering it up, protecting rapists, and turning a blind eye.  See this.  ", "Just saw the film. It didn't hit me, the scope of what they did, and what they were researching until the end. City after city.

I completely agree about the film staying focused and I was so happy there were no overly dramatic Oscar bait scenes. It all felt real - an immersive cinematic experience.

I may have been too young to remember the scandal (3rd grade) but being raised in a large Catholic family where we were all altar boys and going to Catholic school k-12th grade, I only heard off color jokes about molestation, no one ever really discussed the severity of this problem.

Perhaps could not have been acheived without the grim subject matter, but the crescendo at the conclusion, where you saw each character so bursting with raw emotion at what can only be called the power of 5 or 6 individuals to change he course of history just brought me to tears.", "I honestly didn't think this film justified its existence as a movie. Part of it might be that I had seen Concussion the day before, and the two movies are very conceptually similar in terms of plot. But it makes very few attempts to utilize the power of film. Like someone else mentioned, it would make a great documentary. The subject matter is clearly interesting and important, but why was it made into a feature film? Most of the main cast showed little emotional investment in the events they were reporting on. I can understand the need to make a neutral or straightforward recollection of events, but I was probably just expecting too much from the movie. I understand that many were afraid that if it went in a different direction, the film would reek of cookie-cutter melodramatic elements (see Concussion), but it didn't have to go that far, and there is a middle ground that respects the film instead of just dressing it up. The parts I enjoyed the most tended to be the testimony from the victims themselves, which presented a clearer portrayal and connection to the emotional heart of the story. I really enjoyed Liev Schreiber's performance, as well as Neal Huff's, which set me up for thinking there would be other characters I would enjoy, but in my case, I was wrong. And I was really looking forward to watching this because of all the high ratings. :(", "Saw this a few weeks ago and even though I was impressed, I'm honestly shocked by the overwhelming praise it's received. I think it might be because it's a very difficult film to dislike, but for me it also felt like a difficult film to love.\n\nIt is a very good procedural that tells an important story with respect and confidence. But a masterpiece it is not. The only performance that left a real impression on me was Ruffalo. Every choice he made, every line he spoke, it felt like a real person. McAdams comes close but the script really doesn't give her enough. Others (such as Keaton and Schrieber) were competent but lacked nuance or characterization, kind of like they were going through a really good table read. The script streamlines complicated real-life events excellently but doesn't put enough focus on what seems to be the film's key moral dilemma (why didn't we do something sooner? Were we trying to be good Catholics?). \n\nThere were moments where I was really wondering if it would have made a better documentary. There wasn't much drama or style and the characters, even though they felt realistic, also felt realistically normal and plain.\nSpotlight is a competent, good movie, but I struggle with seeing how it could be anyone's favorite of the year. Put this film up against something like Anomalisa, Steve Jobs, or Carol and it just crumbles. \n\nAlso, quick side note: I really liked how realistic the clothes and makeup were in this movie. Everyone's suits fit them but weren't perfectly tailored and some people just didn't look good in some scenes. McAdams had really terrible pants and cheap makeup on the whole time and it actually made me believe the world of them movie more.", "2 years ago I had to choose if I wanted to declare as a Communications Studies major or a Journalism major.

But for all its merits, it had a number of scenes that just felt downright shoddy. The most notable one I can recall off the top of my head is the interview that Rachel MacAdams' character conducts in the playground. You have this amazing shot of them standing in a playground, surrounded by children, against the background of a church, and instead of letting that geography and the scary closeness of the playground and the church sink in, you have the interviewee say, \"I'm sorry, I knew I was going to cry, I knew this was going to happen. And of COURSE there's a church right behind me.\" I mean, I rarely care all that much about exposition or unrealistic dialogue to post about it online, but the majority of the film did such a good job at building the environment these characters inhabit, that scenes like that one felt distractingly bad and lazy.\n\nIn terms of what I loved about it, I think my favorite aspect is the way in which the city of Boston unravels over the course of the film. You actually see these characters walk, drive, or take cabs to different offices and government buildings. You follow them as they make their way around the city, so when one of them walks out of his house, and jogs to the address of a child rapist in a disturbingly short amount of time, you can feel the shock of your neighborhood and your community suddenly feeling tainted and extremely dangerous. The last few scenes of the film probably go the farthest in terms of showing just how interconnected these neighborhoods really are, and you see a number of the interviewees like Patrick going about their lives as the camera follows the main characters taking a cab back to their offices. All in all, if it weren't for some of those other jarring scenes, this would be one of my favorite films of the year, but I'd definitely love to see more films about investigative journalism that relay the *feel* of the journalistic process as well as this one does.", "This was a totally engrossing film which kept me closely tuned in throughout!

It instead focused on the how of the story and kept it interesting. There was no needless exposition, side points of the plot were either loosely implied or not covered at all. Mark Ruffalo's character was a prime example of this. Instead of creating some side story bullshit involving his love life we are give a few details here and there that allow us to piece it together instead. \n\nI really, really enjoyed this movie.

Overall, I thought the comedy was strong with very few rough patches, considering I was fucking crying of laughter during a few points in the movie. And by a few points, I mean any scene with Mr. Green. I loved his representation as the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future in a completely realistic, veteran stoner way of thinking. Hands down the best Christmas comedy performance since Will Ferrell in Elf imo. I loved the tribute paid to the many Christmas classics like Home Alone, Die Hard, and The Grinch; those tributes put a smile on my face each time. The cameos were strong and slightly over the top sometimes, but I found myself laughing at each character. It felt natural to connect to Ethan (stuck in the past) as character, it felt hard to connect to Chris (stuck in the present) as a character (but I think that's because most people don't know someone who's a famous athlete so of course his character is hard to relate to) and despite all the critics I think Seth Rogan really helped carry the movie just because I knew Isaac (stuck in the future) was tripping balls for its entirety (Seth Rogan's specialty). In the end I'm a sucker for love and felt natural chemistry between all of the characters, but in particularly Ethan and Diana. The oh-so uncommon love story felt natural and real while being interwoven between the facets of dirty comedy and really made the movie come together for me. I don't believe in ratings when it comes to comedies, its either worth a watch or it isn't, and this Christmas rom-com is worth every penny if you enjoy a good laugh. I walked out of theater happier, that's a movie success in my opinion.\n\ntl;dr smoke this and enjoy", "I don't think I've ever laughed harder at a dick joke in my entire life ", "That cameo though.\n\nSaw it coming, but I didn't see it coming like that.", "Dope dick homey.", "I like this movie because I like comedy Film", "This movie was more laugh out loud than 'The Interview' (Interview was hilarious but it just felt weird).

I bet if 100 people were asked the names of the members of 451 they wouldn't be able to name them all. \n\nThe love-triangle ending was also a bit rushed in the film. Basically for those that missed it (I've seen some people wondering why she didn't end up with Gale), Coin used Gale's military tactic for the bombing of the refugee children including medic Prim. Even though Gale would never use that tactic for that purpose, only during a warzone, his tactic killed Katniss' sister.\n\nThe happily ever after pissed me off too, first of all, in the book she is badly burned because of the bombs, and she hasn't got kids yet, she says maybe in 5, 10, 15 years, not 5 minutes!", "Aww man, the first person to die out of that group is the black guy", "Wow, I had a lot of fun with this film. It's the best of the series and balanced tension with action quite well. \n\nWhat made it so bittersweet for myself wasn't that the series came to an end, but this is may be one of the last series my sister and I watch together because of my impending graduation and our lives ahead. \n\nWe were hyped for every Harry Potter film, and then The Hunger Games. Kinda sad, but I'm happy to have shared it with the best sibling in the world. \n\nQuestion for anyone who understands sign language: What did Polloux say to Katniss before her and Gale's march towards the Capital?", "29 year old man reporting here. Favorite scene was the avox doing his sign language to Katniss to say goodbye. Couldn't they have Margery Tyrell translate for the crowd or put subtitles? What did he say? Also, the kiss between Haymitch and Effie was weird as fuck. ", "At the end of the day if you enjoyed the previous movies, you'll like this, if not, it won't be your cup of tea. \n\n\n\nEdit: This was a blanket statement, obviously what applied to me isn't going to apply to everyone, with that in mind if you absolutely hated 1, 2, and 3 the same will probably be true here too", "First thing I have to say is that Josh Hutcherson absolutely killed his role as Peeta, not only in this film but in the whole series. He really showed his range in this final film  and was a perfect fit in such a demanding role. The way he transitioned from normal to insane to a recovering torture victim is just mind blowing to me. I look forward to seeing more movies with him, dude has serious talent. \n\nI was kind of put off by the sewer scene. No where in any of the previous movies did we have any information about I Am Legend type zombies and all of a sudden they come out of no where. The scene, however, was well done. It's where my interest in the movie peaked, but I felt it was reaching. \n\nThe last 30 minutes of the movie was so rushed. I felt lost and confused through most of it. One second Katniss is getting blown away, then she's recovering with severe burns, then she's fully healed and meeting with the new president. That right there is at least 6 months of time gone. Only then are they deciding who the interim president is and what to do with Snow... Then at the end Peeta and Katniss are just living in isolation. It was just weird. I wish I would've seen more weakness and PTSD from Katniss and Peeta at the end instead of the hamfisted \"I'm coping\" lines from Katniss", "As someone who is a HUGE fan of the books and the movies...\n\nI am very sad to see it all end.  Fuck!  What a wild ride.  \n\nI thought most of the pivotal scenes were handled really well...the part in the film where Katniss and Gale go off on their own into the Capitol city circle or whatever with the refugees until the very end was the same exact way it was in my head, they killed it.  \n\nIt was terribly sad and heartbreaking.  I was full on was choking back sobs when Katniss gets back to 12 and she is transitioning to life without Prim, and let me tell you...I'm not really a cryer.  The Buttercup scene had the same effect on me as it did in the book.  That's when I lost it.  I thought the ending was beautiful.  Overall, it was a great finale to my favorite series.  I don't know what else to say at the moment as I just got back and am still processing it all.  Thank you Francis Lawrence for bringing this series to life so beautifully and so true to the books.  Thank you Suzanne Collins for creating this story that has effected me on so many levels.  \n\nAnd before I get a smartass comment about me being a 16 year old girl...I am a 24 year old man.  ", "Why didn't the makeup tiger lady just disguise Katniss and Gale when they were trying to get into the mansion. She could have changed their faces.", "Katniss is great with a bow and arrow but can't throw a cup at a cat", "Did anyone else catch how at the victor house when it was raining Katniss and Peeta were sitting in the same position as they were atop the training center in the Hunger Games? ", "Katniss and co. needed to hire a Witcher to take care of those nekkers in the sewers...\n\nEdit: Changed from The Capitol as this makes more sense", "I think I'm in the minority in favoring MJ Part 1 over Part 2.  I thought part 1 had some beautiful scenes, although they could have been a little stricter with the editing (why do we need to see Gale and Katniss hunting outside of district 13?  Boring.)  However, I loved how they showed the rebels fighting in various districts (the scene in District 8 with the loggers, the scene of the dam being blown up, etc).  Katniss's PTSD and mourning/worry for Peeta grabbed me right in the feels as well.  As for Part 2, I love Peeta and Katniss together, so I was excited to see their scenes and that they ended up together.  I wish at the end they had her do a voice over with what she says in the book about Peeta, though.  It would have been much more powerful with the voice over than how they did it.  This is the quote:\n\n\u201cPeeta and I grow back together. There are still moments when he clutches the back of a chair and hangs on until the flashbacks are over. I wake screaming from nightmares of mutts and lost children. But his arms are there to comfort me. And eventually his lips. On the night I feel that thing again, the hunger that overtook me on the beach, I know this would have happened anyway. That what I need to survive is not Gale's fire, kindled with rage and hatred. I have plenty of fire myself. What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again. And only Peeta can give me that. So after, when he whispers, \"You love me. Real or not real?\" I tell him, \"Real.\u201d\n", "Just got out of the theater. My initial reaction is fantastic. I really don't have anything to gripe about immediately and I have so much to love. The writing was sooooo much better than Part 1. I was really impressed with the writing, tone, and acting performances all around. J Law is in great form. Josh Hutcherson was an incredibly pleasant surprise. The movie didn't hold back and pushed the envelope exactly when it needed to. \n\nI was particularly pleased with the slow burn, natural reparation of Katniss and Peeta's love. I read the book and was fine with how it played out there, but I was nervous that it wouldn't translate to the screen well. They really churned it out. Like butter. \n\nThe cinematography was great. There were two shots with Katniss in her assassin's cloak that I particularly loved: one, when she is leaving Tigris's and hesitates at the door; two, when the camera swings back behind her to frame her in the lower left when the parachute bombs are falling. The sewer scenes were beautifully shot as well.\n\nEverything felt impactful. It felt focused. It was a great action movie with commendable dramatic technique. My first grade says it's at least as good as Catching Fire, but I think the production values are even higher for Mockingjay Part 2. I am very satisfied. \n\nKatniss's closing line was beautifully delivered, as well. Great scene to wrap it all up. ", "As someone who didn't read the books, did they do a better job explaining the mutts? The movie didn't really seem to treat them as anything shocking, they were just kind of like \"Oh, sewer mutants, of course. We really should have seen that coming\".", "I'll preface this by saying that I don't usually cry during movies and I didn't cry during this one--but I haven't been so close to crying during a film in an incredibly long time.\n\nWhat truly did it for me was Katniss approaching the mansion, and as she does so, the speakers go on and say that the children need to be passed forward. And then all these little children are pulled from their parents, and JNH's score in the background is heartbreaking, and then the parachutes fall and you hear the cries of all these hopeful children--\n\nThat was a stand out moment for me, obviously.\n\nThere's so much more to talk about. Let's start with the epilogue--so simple, so why did I never even think of it?! I used to spend a lot of time trying to figure out ways for them to keep that final line in there and I ended up thinking up a complicated one of Katniss writing a letter to Haymitch and her narrating it as she writes it. But this was obviously so much better. And then you can see Katniss's hair is starting to turn gray, too. So much detail! And then that little hug between Peeta and the eldest child is heartwarming. And the final shot is Katniss looking on...cue Deep in the Meadow. Loved it. The Buttercup scene was heartwrenching, too. Jen's acting here was superb (as usual).\n\nI've heard some complaints about Coin's execution being a) too short and b) too expected. I can understand why it would feel too short to some (it's literally exactly that in the book), and I can understand why it was too obvious for some. Yes, you can kind of see how Katniss will handle the situation, and I think the reason most of us were so surprised while reading the book was because we didn't have the visuals to catch on (\"I vote yes for Prim\"). I liked the execution scene and thought they did it well.\n\nI noticed that Katniss never shoots a random Capitol lady. We know they shot the scene so hopefully it will be on the Blu-ray and maybe part of an extended edition?\n\nStand out performances: DONALD SUTHERLAND. He is a genius. His laugh when Coin was shot is perfect and terrifying. Josh did a fabulous job, as usual, but I could really feel Peeta's pain this time around. Jena Malone is fearless as Johanna! I'm glad we got to see more of her this time around. And finally, Jennifer Lawrence just owned this. I have nothing more to say about that.\n\nI need to see the film again, but its safe to say that it is my favorite of the four.", "Someone explain why the fuck Tony the Tiger shows up half way through?", "What was with that oil trap? Peeta shoved the guy in it and suddenly he was strung up on some sort of wires. Did the oil do that, or was there another trap that they had stepped over and Peeta happened to push him onto it?", "\"Did you have a nightmare? I have nightmares too.\"\n\nThat line came off really creepy, because Katniss' nightmares are *way* worse than a baby's. It undercuts the beautiful, snarky last line about \"worse games to play\".\n\nA lot of lines were lifted from the book and, while I appreciate them, they needed to feel more natural. Peeta's motivational in Tigris' hideout sounded like a voiceover for a generic trailer instead of a natural, heartbroken ramble that his still-unstable character should've given.\n\nThis is a great series but it needs to occasionally step back and take a wide shot - books *tell* while movies *show*. I want to *feel* Katniss' grief and emotion with Buttercup; for example, let me see her alone in the kitchen, huddled and despairing and grieving at everything she's lost, and then have the cat slowly move into the frame and curl up beside her, reminding her that not everything is lost - J Law is excellent at showing Katniss' detachment and scarring from the games, but we lose the inner dialogue and the conflict that makes her human.  I *want* to grieve over the deaths.\n\nAnd in this film, by itself, Prim and Finnick get very little development.  Prim gets maybe three scenes?  And they're establishing shots, not character building.  Without the heart-to-heart from the Part 1, we would know nothing about Prim.  It's been years since the audience has seen the first film and felt Katniss' overwhelming desire to save her sister.  We need a reminder, a callback, a symbol to invoke nostalgia and sorrow over this little girl - maybe have the sunlight glint off a mockingjay pin on Prim before the bombs go off and, as the camera pans out from unconscious Katniss, have Katniss' voice repeat the line from the beginning about \"as long as you wear this, nothing bad can happen to you\".  The same goes with Finnick - he's an awesome guy that gets very little development in Part 2.  Maybe I'll feel something more when watching all the movies in a row, but by itself, this film presents Finnick as a very static character.\n\nThe directors did an excellent job with transforming the themes of each film, but they need to be tied together better to build a strong emotional connection.\n\nEdit: AND there's no mockingjay pin at the end of the credits!\n\nEdit 2: added some thoughts", "Finnick Odair's last stand was one of the greatest scenes in the series. The moment he shouted, \"KATNISS!!!\", it kept echoing in my head throughout the rest of the movie. ", "Just got out, I loved it overall. \n\nThe \"big scene\" at the end was done so well, I didnt read any of the books but I just loved the way it happened. Tigress scared the shit out of me; none of the other mutants did. Natalie Dormer looked fine as F throughout. Katniss drooled all over that cat. The baby at the end was too damned chubby and adorable. I really enjoyed the color tones of the movie throughout.", "I really liked it, until the last 5 minutes.\n\nIf there's one thing I hate in movies, its when they do \"x years later\" parts at the end. Where apparently they went back to dressing like they're amish, had some kids and live in the shire.\n\nThat, and prime death just felt tossed in.  Like you'd think it would have been a much bigger deal.", "Re-title it to Hunger Games: Almost Everyone is Dead. ", "It was a bit jarring how PSH disappeared almost completely for the second half of the film, but I thought the movie was much better than Part 1 and better than the book. ", "Overall I think this this is a case where the movie was more powerful than the book. Suzanne Collins wrote the book to try and deliver that \"shock value\" of \"this is war\" to her audience, but she was so limited by her medium. Hunger Games isn't LoTR, it's geared towards young adults, and the style of writing reflects that. While that makes for a more digestible book, it also removes a lot of the literary nuances of world building, narration, and description that other narrative sagas are able to use successfully to draw the reader in emotionally. Her message was too ambitious for her medium. \n\nBut not too ambitious for the silver screen however! All the little nuances mentioned before lend themselves easily to a visual and auditory medium. The music, the shock value of actually seeing people die, the suspense building of the sewer scene, the last conversation between Katniss and Snow, the capitol scene. Every single part of it played to make Collin's original message resound louder and more powerful. That's why movies like Saving Private Ryan and Hurt Locker are so successful...the medium they're in naturally lends itself to that kind of message.\n\nIn conclusion, a very surprisingly good wrap up to a decent adaptation. Bonus points for sticking really close to source material", "I feel that this was much better than the book- the trouble with *Mockingjay* is that the ending of the book felt horribly, terribly rushed. It was a bit of a mess, and splitting the book into two separate films was for the best.\n\nIt's not just for the sake of telling the story well, but in communicating themes; it felt like the ideas from the book were better communicated by this movie. Would Katniss trade one dictator for another? Would she let the cycle repeat with a new figurehead? Nope. While I don't know if the plot twist at the end was as effective for folks who haven't read the book, I feel that the scene was well executed (no pun intended)- particularly Snow's dreadful last laughter. On the whole, I was pleased with *Mockingjay Part II*.", "Before I start, I'm an advocate for The Hunger Games in general. For as much as everyone likes to lump it in with other young adult fiction that panders to teenage girls, I think The Hunger Games stands on it's own merits. For one, Katniss isn't special, she knows it, and so does everyone who has the trouble of working with her. She's a capable girl who found herself in a situation where she could exploit what she knew about the capital to survive thanks to the help of a great supporting team. She became a symbol for the rebellion, but was a tool to those who ran the revolution. The series is all about media and propaganda, and Katniss is right in the middle of it because of circumstance. Even the love triangle kind of plays on that trope, she's not in love with the doe eyed new boy, she's putting on a show for the masses, giving them what they want. Ultimately, she understands him more and more, and starts to want to be like him in an idealistic way, just as he wanted to be brave and strong like her straight from the get go (is that character development?). I haven't seen the Divergent movies or read the books, but I've had the displeasure of seeing their trailers before each of the Hunger Games showings. Whereas that movie seems to play on the idea that the introverted girl is special and the secret group of people will find her and turn her into someone who can fight and take care of herself and eventually lead, The Hunger Games flips that. Katniss has to pretend to be that person.\n\nOn to the movie, I thought it was solid. I think it should've ended a scene early (with Katniss joining Peta in... bread), or had that scene as an after credits.\n\nThe shots were all very dynamic. For whatever reason, I noticed a lot of close ups. I feel like the movie would have been stronger had this been done less frequently. I loved Snow's laugh at the end, but I would have been happier if they showed it from Katniss's perspective, then he would be charged by the crowds. While I felt the sewer action was all good, it was, in my opinion, too long. Once they were at the ladder, it seemed like the mutts kept jumping on them and they weren't moving anywhere. \n\nRegarding the love triangle, I felt like Gale was the biggest tool, where he wasn't in the previous 3 films. His biggest concern was how he wasn't getting enough love from Katniss. For a character with so much focus on the war, someone willing to build manipulative weapons for massive damage, it seemed backwards. Peta's infatuation was just that though, so it had it's place, and Katniss (for the first movie and a half) was always putting on a show, and thereafter didn't know how to feel about their relationship. I thought it was nice that they settled down and were able to be comfortable for each other, if disappointingly conventional.\n\nThe film touches on themes of PTSD (carried over from Part 1), the killing of few to save many (rules of war), and the quenching of revenge or retribution. To my surprise, I actually think these get addressed too. Katniss talks about how she copes with her nightmares. Through the bombing of all the kids followed by her complete rejection of Gale, his ideology, about how the rules of war should be thrown out the window, is shown very very negatively. \n\nAlmost all of my other big complaints come down to the films being split into two parts. The slow, quiet moments are great, but I feel like there's plenty of dialogue that kind of goes without saying and would have been cut in order to make a tighter movie. All the cuts from the Capital news proclaiming that Katniss was dead didn't need to be there (although the cannon firing when they show their names was a great touch). I thought both parts were solid, but I think they would have been much stronger as one telling. Both films try to have a beginning, middle, and end, but ultimately I think both films feel much smaller than if they had been combined.\n\nTLDR: I like The Hunger Games books and movies in general, this was a pretty solid entry. It would have been much stronger had it not been two parts. There were a few choices I disagreed with, but I was engaged the whole time. Nothing too groundbreaking, but it's a satisfying enough conclusion to a solid enough franchise. ", "I wish they hadn't continued with the epilogue. It would've been really nice to end the movie on the last word.", "Did anyone have a favorite death? They completely fucked up my favorite death from the book. In the book, Messalla gets caught in a ray of light and is frozen in place. Then the unit watches as his skin slowly melts away.\n\nIn the movie, there's a flash and he falls apart like jenga blocks in half a second. That was very disappointing. :\\", "Movie was a 8/10. It took a while for it to get going, but when it did, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. What I didn't like was how blatantly obvious they made it that Katniss was going to shoot Coin instead. That was so surprising when reading the books. The epilogue was fine. Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Should have really ended with Katniss and Peeta in the bed together. Would have been way more fitting. Like I said. Movie is slow as balls at points, but when things get going it's great. Solid conclusion in my opinion.", "So captain phasma was it in for like 45 seconds, as was t-bag, and even Remy Danton had a tiny role. \n\nWasted actors. ", "I love dystopian young adult films, so I really enjoyed all of this but the ending (note that I haven't read the book). I enjoyed it all the way through Effie Trinket telling Katniss that it was her job to take care of herself now - that moment was so, so cruel to me. After Katniss had been used, and used, and used again as a tool of propaganda on so many levels, and *now* she had her life back (after it had been torn apart) was awful and wonderful. But most everything past that felt like the kind of propaganda the ruling powers *would've* sold to the public about Katniss Everdeen, post-war. In fact, it felt like it was meant to soothe the movie audience as well, glossing over the horror of Katniss' post-war life and mental health after all that had been done to her (and all that she'd been forced to choose).  \n\nStill, it was a beautiful movie - my favourite shot was probably President Coin falling after being shot, dressed in almost surreally-structured, cool grey fabrics. Just absolutely lovely. The movie made me miss Phillip Seymour Hoffman as well - he should have filled much more screentime, which would've benefitted the movie as well.", "Its been a while since I read Mockingjay, and in that time I blocked Finnick's death out of my memory. He was my favorite character in the books, and the movie too. Watching Finnick die was like getting stabbed in the heart a second time. All the pain that I had forgotten of when he died in the books just came rushing back. Safe to say, I was pissed. RIP Finnick...sniffle.", "The reason why everyone hates it so much??\n\nThe main message revolving media and entertainment, how we live for blood and guts, how we're all so brainless.. Guess what? The reactions prove that message!\n\nYou wanted a big finale? You don't care for Katniss' tragic emotional trauma at the end? How she was a hero, then completely CRACKED at her sister's death, screaming in depression at her cat?? You don't  give a fuck, do you?? No. You just want more explosions. More CGI.\n\nFuck off. This movie deserves at least an 8/10. Book readers have NO reason to be disappointed. If you didn't like the book, then sure. But if you liked the book and you expected a \"big finale,\" you need to get mentally evaluated. I LOVED the movie because I read a sad, depressing book about the consequences of war. So did you! But guess what? Somehow you thought the movie based on that book would be the Battle of Hogwarts 2.0! How idiotic..", "If they faithfully followed the story, then I'm not surprised the movie is dark and depressing. When I finished the book I was impressed that the author was willing to go to there. It made total sense and not hollywood at all. ", "Anyone else think the jump scares were a bit cheap? Good movie and a great ending to the series overall though for fans of the franchise.", "I read the book but it's been a while and don't remember a lot of it. I was confused by her reasoning for rejecting Gale. Did Gale actually know about the bombs? Or did Katniss just assume that he knew about them?", "[UNMARKED SPOILERS FOR MOCKINGJAY (PT 2) FOLLOW]\n\nTo: President Snow\n\n**FOR YOUR EYES ONLY**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you again for choosing Panem Risk Itemization Chartered Kollective. We are honoured to be selected this year as the Capitols\u2019 Chief External Auditor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on key government initiatives based on our audit.\n\nIn our opinion, while the government has outdone itself again in maintaining law and order, there is much room for improvement. Our key findings are as follows:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[A] INEFFICIENT EMPLOYMENT OF MUTTS**\n\nWe note that spending on Mutts has tripled this year as the Biological Institute pursued creating numerous new strains to \u201ccater to all eventualities\u201d. However, we caution that not enough is being done to ensure that Mutts are environmentally-friendly. The high collateral damage caused by Mutts raises serious questions as to their economic efficiency.\n\nIn particular, we observed how the new Lizard-Mutt strains show high propensities for unchecked-breeding when released, and we question the Institute\u2019s ability to recall this strain once it has been deployed, if at all. Based on our simulations, there is an 85% chance that they will breed uncontrollably if ever let loose in their natural habitats, for example, in the Panem Interconnected Sewer System. \n\nThis in turn leads to a 98% probability that once they exhaust natural food reserves in the sewers, they will venture further to hunt in order to sustain their explosive growth. In all likelihood, they may even crawl up connected pipelines to hunt. \n\nIn other words, within 2 weeks of the Lizard-Mutt\u2019s deployment, no citizen in Panem will be able to take a shit in peace again. We strongly advise against the deployment of the Lizard-Mutt strain under any circumstances.\n\nOf note as well are the vast sums expensed on non-viable strains. At this juncture, there is no basis to believe that the Hamster-Mutt or the Chihuahua-Mutt strains will ever develop into valuable military assets.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[B] EXCESSES IN PODS INCORPORATED SPECIALIZED SERVICES**\n\nThere is no denying the contributions Pods Incorporated Specialized Services have brought to Panem. They are integral not only to the Hunger Games, but to the defence of our fair city. Nevertheless, as a government-linked statutory board, more is to be desired of Pods Incorporated and the manner in which they manage their operations. \n\nAt the outset, and despite warnings from previous years, Pods Incorporated have not relented in their deployment of Pods across Panem. At last count, the average Pod-Density in Panem is 120 Pods / square kilometre. This clearly exceeds the international standard of 30 Pods Every Combined Kilometre (Except Rectangularly). \n\nIn other words, we are concerned that the continual employment of Pods no longer serves any discernible military objective, but are instead directed towards driving up profit margins for the company. Further, our audit has revealed that while quantity is not in question, quality certain is. \n\nAfter all, our 15 year-old interns / non-contract employees were able to outwit 70% of the Pods we encountered in our audit, owing to a combination of incomplete implementation (Pods measuring less than 200 metres, which is much more than the average 15 year-old can run), poor concealment (covers were not installed on the Ceiling Death Rays), and substandard maintenance (locations of Pods given away by a very telling arrangement of dead bodies around killzones).\n\nA case in point is the Black Tarpool Pod, the budget for which alone invited great scrutiny. We stress again that the huge containers required to store the quick-drying tar is a dead giveaway for the Pod\u2019s location, and that clean-up is essentially impossible. This Pod is far better employed repairing Panem\u2019s severely damaged road network system.\n\nOf note as well is the woefully inadequate IT security system installed by Pods Incorporated. There is a 95% risk that a hostile force may easily hack the mainframe and download records of all installed Pods. We theorize that an enemy combatant could waltz through our city with a complete 3D map of all Pods, if IT security is not urgently improved.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[C] PLACEMENT OF NEW TOWN SQUARE**\n\nWe applaud the reallocation of funds to better the Capitol\u2019s public infrastructure, in particular the siting of the new Town Square. Boasting a seating capacity of over 10,000, with unparalleled visual and auditory innovations to allow even the farthest citizen to participate meaningfully, this new Town Square is undeniably the pinnacle of modern design sensibilities and aesthetics.\n\nIt is therefore entirely regrettable that the Town Square has also been gazetted as the new Public Execution Ground.\n\nOur audit of the Town Square plans reveal arrangements for you, President Snow, to preside from the raised dais as public executions of rebel leaders (especially the accused Mocking Jay, may she put on too much weight to fly) take place below.\n\nThe complex computer simulations and ballistics diagnostics we ran only confirmed what my five year-old son pointed out, when he tagged along on Bring Your Kids To Work Day \u2013 it is a Bad Idea for you, President Snow, to stand in the line of fire as the planned executions are carried out.\n\nThe risk is so high that in a number of run-throughs, our crash-test dummy taking your intended place on the dais could even be penetrated by a humble arrow fired by hand from the executioner\u2019s starting point. The risk only amplifies when live bullets are used. \n\nWe emphasise that the New Town Square presents a going concern in our audit. As things stand, the risk of you being improperly penetrated against your will during a live execution is unacceptable.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[D] CONCLUSION**\n\nOn a final note, we highlight that we have also reviewed the directives for \u201cGetting Rid of Ineffective Military Commanders, in War-Time (Vol. 1)\u201d. We strongly caution against the use of poison additives during a dinner course where you, President Snow, will also be attending. There is no accounting for service standards these days, and therefore no guarantee that the service staff will ensure that the poison will end up on the intended plate.\n\nFurthermore, it is socially frowned-upon and frankly, quite rude to poison any of your Commanders in service. This also increases litigation risks based on claims that you are trying to dismiss active military staff without payment of the customary pensions upon discharge. \n\nWe will let you have the full report in due course. Thank you once again for choosing Panem Risk Itemization Chartered Kollective. \n\nMay the Odds be ever in your favour.\n \n", "1) kind of an unpopular opinion: but as a huge fan of the books I actually like the fact that it was 2 movies.

Just the way the music lined up so well.", "Really, really wish they had just rolled credits after Katniss crawls into bed with Peeta. That was one of the most authentic and emotional scenes in any of the film and it was immediately followed by what I thought was the WORST scene in any of the movies. Other than that, though, it was a pretty entertaining action film.", "I would say any problems the movie had were issues the book had as well. Namely being that everything Katniss did in this was for nothing,  they wander around and get killed off just to stumble across the rebels' final attack. They really should have had her assassination mission be a success to give meaning to the deaths like Peeta said. Instead they achieve nothing, get banished basically when Katniss kills Coin (one last speech to the people about never letting tyranny reign again would have done wonders) and it's all just a pitiful affair. \n\nI still enjoyed it, I just think the protagonists should have played a more active role in things and achieved something. The only achievement is killing Coin and not many people in the new Panem understand why she did it and will view Katniss as a murderous Psycho. \n\nI'm awful and wish the film would have ended with Peeta and Katniss in bed with Peeta having a nightmare and Katniss holding him, shaking herself. Really drive home that these are broken people. And depress the audience even more. ", "I went in not expecting much and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it (haven't read the books). It was bleak and jarringly violent, and did not glorify war/revolution, which is something Hollywood seems to lean towards. Of course there are plenty of movies that don't do this, but it seems like those are usually targeted at adults; I did not expect it from a movie adapted from a YA book. \n\nI'm seeing a lot of criticism for Jennifer Lawrence and her seemingly wooden acting, but I thought it fit perfectly in that it showed how she is just a relatively normal girl who did something rash in a moment of fear (volunteer for Prim), and has to suffer the unexpected consequences of being dragged through a revolution as a poster girl - she's constantly in a daze and is probably losing her mind from trying to process so many emotions at once. Her breakdown at the end is when the floodgates finally open and all of her confused emotions come spilling out because she has lost the one person she was trying to protect from the beginning. I also wanna add that I thought her acting was amazing in that scene - the body-wracking sobs, the 110% full-on ugly crying - the most emotion we've seen out of Katniss.\n\nSome comments also say the reveal of the cat at the end was a bad decision for that scene, but I saw it as showing how traumatized Katniss is; an innocent cat sets her on edge and probably conjures up the worst expectations in her mind as she approaches the kitchen.", "Im going to have nightmares about Finnick's death. Holy shit. ", "Ah man, that sewer battle was INTENSE. Great to see Katniss use her bow and arrow again, makes it seem like all of her training was building up to this fight. Now that I think of it, all of the action sequences were really well done. It was aware of its spatial limitations, and was chaotic enough to feel unsettling but yet easy to understand.", "What happened the guy who disintegrated after he got hit by the light in the subway? It looked like he got turned into bullets. \n\nAbout that scene, I really liked how the group had to keep moving in order to survive. They could process these death only much, much later. ", "I haven't seen it yet. My only question is, did they stick true to the books at the end with Prim and the Presidents? \n\nEdit: if they did, then I definitely will be going to the movie. ", "As a reader of the books, I really enjoyed this movie. At first I was completely opposed to it being split into 2 parts, but...wow. They made it work. If it had been 1 movie, it would not have done justice to the \"before\" and \"after\", or giving way to the absolute resolution of the series. \n\nAlso, thay sewer scene - phew. I vividly remember reading the book so fast that when I realized Finnick had died, I had to go back and make sure what I read was right - and being completely heart-broken! It may be much, but I felt that twinge and dread in my heart when that scene was coming up.\nPretty solid ending for a series.  ", "Really enjoyed it. It was my favorite book out of the three. Jennifer Lawrence is fucking phenomenal.", "I thought it was the weakest of the four, although I know I'm in the minority who really liked part 1. \n\nThe bombing move at the end was completely transparent. No one would believe that cold, calculating Snow would do something that stupid. He had nothing to gain by bombing children and first responders. I didn't read the books, so I'm not sure if that's an issue with the film or the source material. \n\nI do like that they gave Katniss a compelling reason to not choose Gale. Interesting choice to have Gale and Peeta address the love triangle directly in that basement conversation, but not necessarily bad. \n\nI agree with those who were saying Coin was a caricature of a villain at the end. Once again, a completely transparent move that killed my suspension of disbelief.", "What about that Asian baby at the end. The baby katniss was holding.

Then he'll assume Katniss is dead after seeing one explosion and not looking at other security footage.", "Damn, Gale got a cold sendoff. More so than the books", "There are some really fucked up moments (in a good way), I'm surprised they got away with what they did in a PG-13 movie though.", "Just saw part 2 and did not read the books. Thoughts as they come to mind:\n\nI believe part one was better. I think the scene where the power goes out in the Capitol; the moment you realize \"oh this is really happening...the \"perfect\" life as we know it is about to change\"... And that realization in Snow; that was very powerful to me. (And other intense moments like this). Part one created such a momentum, that I wouldn't have minded sitting there for another hour or two for the films to conclude and give us the finale we were waiting for.\n\nWhat part two delivered though, in a good way, was something different than we would expect from typical Hollywood. I think there is genius in the story. I felt a little underwhelmed though, not to witness the revolution happen, after all we've been through. Of course that bloodthirst is part of the point that is made; at which point do we become the enemy?\n\n I was really confused about Prim. I thought Katniss was hallucinating or something. \n\nThere should be a lesson with Tigris - I see people really shocked and disturbed by the character. It should be a lesson in not judging others because they are different (appearance, orientation, race, religion) she afterall was a good person and aided our Heros in the film, as so many people protect and serve daily in our real world. ", "Well. It was far better than Part 1.\n\nHad a lot of slower moments. Any twists coming were actually pretty obvious. I am mostly sad that Finnick died. He was the best.\n\nI also wish we had more Tucci. He got only one scene!\n\n", "I thought they did a great job with the CG Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Sure, the following scene with Haymitch reading the letter was forced because of the last minute rewrite, but overall, they handled the situation well. **RIP Phil**", "SPOILERS\nJust to add: I just rewatched The Hunger Games (the first one), and I was surprised on how they bookended a lot of stuff. Like Gale and Katniss talking about not having children in HG, and in MJ2 it was Peeta and Katniss looking over their children. Also got reminded of the bread thing they were talking about in MJ2.\n\nYou get to appreciate the series more if you look at it in totality rather than the parts.", "Both Mockingjay films ended being like the book: disappointing. I think there were problems with the main source, but the film could have done better overall.\n\nI liked it though. The sets and action secuences were outstanding, and I loved everything that happened in the sewers. It was the brightest point of the book for me (ironically), and the adaptation was good. The most awful parts were undoubtely the slow pacing, editing and cut parts.\n\n7/10. Farewell Catnip.", "I don't much like the Mockingjay book, so by extension I'm not a huge fan of this movie's plot. \n\nWith that out of the way, my biggest problem with this movie is the same as Part One: it just doesn't need to be this long. After the bomb scene at the end the movie there's like 30 minutes of resolution. That's ridiculous.\n\nThere were some very good scenes, the aforementioned bomb scene is very well done, although the civilians caught in the crossfire between the Loyalists and Rebels felt a bit like cannon fodder. That's a horrific situation and aside from the little girl screaming, I felt like their plight was thrown to the side.\n\nThe sewer scene was pretty damn frightening and helpless. I really enjoyed it, and it scared most the people in the theatre. However, the scene was very dark, so I had no idea who was getting attacked at what time.\n\nMy last problem with the film was the unceremonious deaths of most the characters. Finnick probably had the most drawn out death, but the film goes straight to another action scene right after. Then the cameraman died so quickly that I literally blinked and missed his death. Prim's death just wasn't very impactful. Most people that I went with forgot that she did medical stuff because they only referenced it in part one. It was weird, all of the sudden Prim was there and then she died. Coin's death was weird in the book and in the movie, I'm pretty sure her death live on air would cause a lot more chaos.\n\nOverall, movie has its ups and its downs. I probably would not go see it in theatres unless you're anxious about the end of Katniss' story. I don't think I'll ever see it again, and I'm okay with that.", "I have read the entire series and now I have finished watching the  final film with my friend who has not read the books so I will use her as a reference point.\n\nFirst of all I give this film a 6.8 or 7/10. If they had combined part 1 and part 2 into a more streamlined film it would probably be a 8-8.5 for me.\n\nPROS\n\n- Jennifer Lawrence continued to capture Katniss perfectly, for better or for worse. \n- Visuals on point\n- Acting in general on point, but I feel like there were many times where there was a lack of emotion due to odd directorial choices, lack of score supporting key moments, and poorly adapted dialogue.\n- Katniss and Prim's cat scene was done beautifully, that was the kind of shit I was expecting more of in this film.\n- The underground tunnel scenes and Finnick's bad ass exit.\n- Katniss and Snow's interaction\n- Katniss' execution of President Coin and their prior round table meeting.\n- Donald Sutherland amazing as always.\n- Julianne Moore Philip Seymour Hoffman did great with what they had.\n- The actual final epilogue scene and Katniss' last line. \n\n\nCONS\n\n- Pacing was garbage because they decided to split the book into two films instead of just having one three hour film.\n- Lack of focus AKA they spent more time on the squad sitting in a building than on Katniss' reaction to Prim's death.\n- Katniss and Gale's conversation was done poorly, even my friend didn't understand why she told Gale to leave. They had one 5 second scene explaining how Gale was behind that style of bombing early in the film.\n- Gwendoline Christie essentially having one 30-second scene despite being interviewed multiple times for the film. What a waste of talent and dumb misdirection.\n- The ending was really rushed in a few places and then dragged out in others (once again the pacing was off overall). They should have focused more on Prim/Gale/Snow/Coin and then stuck to the actual book ending. It would have been much more impactful and quicker.\n- The scene where they take refuge in the stylist's place was not adapted well and didn't fit in the film like how it did in the book.\n- I disliked the score except for that one sad song that was introduced earlier in the series. Could they really not make anything unique for the final film?!\n- Splitting the book into two movies, shame. \n\nMy friend enjoyed the film but she was definitely confused at some crucial points and I had to explain to her the details of Coin's betrayal, Snow's involvement, her break off with Gale, and why Prim was even there. She also agreed that the pacing was a prominent issue.\n", "That last scene with Gale was a lot more harsh than in the books. I really felt bad for the guy.", "Finnick was so brave but still so sad.:(", "I really loved the ending of series. They did a great job bringing it to life. I didn't even mind the Trinket and Haymitch thing.", "Anyone know what was up with that oil trap thing? ", "I loved all the Peeta and Katniss scenes. I was a little disappointed about how far they strayed from the book at times but overall it was a great movie and I saw it with an amazing person which helped too. :)", "Catching Fire is the strongest entry of this series, but I feel like Mockingjay 2 was worth it PURELY for the sewer scene. \n\nThe sewer scene was exactly as I imagined it in the book, and the death there was as well, and it was incredible to see that. I remember reading it at a kid and being scared for days after and to see it on screen was both really weird and so great! Prim deserved better though. I am disappointed that Girl In Yellow Coat had shots that made us feel more for her than Prim. \n\nThe could have shown it as Prim yelling for Katniss to go and run away, and Katniss running towards her sister, the second blast coming and then Katniss waking up in the hospital. That would have brought the WHOLE trilogy full circle, because what started with Katniss volunteering for Prim, ended with Prim trying to protect Katniss. THAT alone would have made up for every lackluster talk-y lead up scene there.", "The scene with Tigress was amazingly ridiculous ", "I really disliked this movie. Apart from the vast array of cinema cliches, there was really no character I could sympethize with. Katniss was basicaly being irrational and selfish half the movie, and in the end 90% of her actions didnt matter in the slightest. Prim dying didnt hit me emotionally at all. All the sudden she popped into the frame and \"oh shes dead now.\" Honestly Finick was the one character I felt anything for, and his last stand was pretty badass.  \n  \nMaybe the book focused more on the political, vicious cycle idea, but that was basically crammed into the last 5% of the movie.", "This movie really disappointed me. It had some great, intense, emotional moments, but there were such long stretches of plodding dialogue, and it was always the same thing: two people talking about something Very Serious while sitting down. ", "I was disappointed. The climax was so great, the final scenes were so satisfying, everything was so perfect. But the filler scenes and the (for the most part) isolation of the squad from the rest of the people killed my hype. So when the character-payoff started happening at the end, I felt so detached that I couldn't enjoy what was happening. It didn't feel like a finale. I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that the community/inspirational aspect of it was left behind in Part 1.\n\nThe movie-split thing can be done well (like \"Deathly Hallows\" where there was enough material for Part 1 and the non-stop relentless action/plot/big moments of Part 2 essentially made it a perfect movie), but it has to be done carefully. And studios need to stop being scared of shorter cuts. Yes, WE KNOW you are just doing this to take more money. But do us a favor and own up to it and just release the 80-100 minute cuts that we all know these films should be.", "For being an elite military team, Squad 451 has some terrible military tactics.  When they are walking they are in zero formation what so ever and no one is at the low/high ready. Compare their movements to some great ones in the squad from Alien. I also fee that Finnick's death could have been prevented with some simple covering and having one person go up the ladder and the rest cover them. Instead of everyone freaking out and leaving him to die. ", "I have to get these things off my chest:\n\n1. Why THE FUCK wasn't Katniss' face covered when she was wearing that stupid robe? I get the idea of her still having her classic character look or whatever, but by the time she's climbing on top of a tank and so exposed, there's only so much suspension of disbelief...to have her go unrecognized like that dramatically lowered the stakes.\n2. What the fuck was that smoke after Prim's death.\n3. I don't think Francis Lawrence likes to let moments sit...there was so much important shit that just got glazed over - IE Prim\n4. The score needed to calm down, lol.\n5. Coin's death was HORRIBLY handled...any element of surprise was just thrown to the wind.\n6. The mother character just vanished.\n7. Epilogue had Katniss in a sundress...what??\n8. MOST IMPORTANT- Why was the closing image we were left with Katniss smiling and holding a baby? Thematically, that just felt so easy and honestly inappropriate for the tone of the series.\n\nThe production design was great for the most part, however. The writing, not so much. It's sad to see it end, though, and I feel sad it ended this way. It didn't feel like a good or satisfying way to send off this important series. Everything just kind of got wrapped up and tossed away. \n\nThere were such good moments in the END of it (Peeta and her sitting by the rain, Katniss hugging Peeta in the sunshine) that it should have just capped off there. It services the movie much better than tacking on that weird epilogue. That was...so...ugh.\n\nBUT I will say one of the most powerful parts of the movie is Katniss shoving through all the Capitol people to get to the mansion - and the people are screaming and lifting their children up to try and save them - that was a moment when it was clear how much things had actually gone to shit.", "What was the ropes pulling the guy up during the oil scene?

Amazing action scenes. Very tense at times, and they let the gravity of their decisions way on them.

The only movies I have left feeling more satisfied this year are Inside Out and Fury Road. I can breakdown the highlights into 4 main points:\n\n* The acting is just great all round. Woody, PSH, even Liam Hemsworth did really well in his last scene. Jen and Josh were both fantastic, paritcularly Lawrence in the scene with the cat, and - of course - Donald Sutherland is a master-class in villainy.\n* I loved the story. I love the idea that Plutarch was playing Coin, Coin was playing Snow, and Snow was trying to play Katniss. Plutarch gets his way in the end, which is actually a poisitive outcome, but I found it really refreshing that Mockingjay addressed the political scheming that comes with the horrors of war. Katniss was the main character, but her life was never really her own until after the war has ended.\n* I am continually impressed by how amazing the setting of the Hunger Games looks. The Capitol felt very real, concrete and crumbling, as do most parts of the series. I put this on Francis Lawrence's great direction, whilst other YA series like Divergent are just ugly CG messes.\n* Finally the sewer scene. There were no scenes I did not like; Katniss talking down the man in D2, the black liquid scene, Katniss  face to face with Snow... but the sewer scene had my heart pounding. I have not been that tense in the theatre in a long time, even though I read the books. The design of the Mutts was terrifying, they vastly improved Finnick's death, and the build up to the action was edge-of-your-seat stuff.\n\nI had a few small complaints. The soundtrack was reused to often, and the amazing \"Hanging Tree\" from part 1 was not used enough. The last line worked better in Katniss' head like the books, and the ending was slow, but I found myself appreciating every scene, so I can't complain. I was worried the cast was too large, but even when the forgettable characters died I felt bad, like when the building came down on the sisters (I audibly gave an \"oh shit\"), or with Pollux crying after his brother's death. Part 2 just did so well at taking parts I liked from the book and doing them justice, and taking what I didn't like or found too rushed, and improving upon it. I don't understand the complaints about the 2-movie split either, seeing as the parts added to 1 improved it greatly (seeing the Capitol raid), and 2 was pretty much straight off the page with minimal added.\n\nBrutal view of war, heartwrenching dialogue, refreshing climax, great acting, intense action, wonderful visuals, satisfying conclusion.\n\n**9/10**\n\n**4>2>3>1**", "Okay, for everyone who was upset by Prim's death, try and explain to me what her character was.\n\nExactly.\n\nShe wasn't a character, she was a prop.

I read the books, so it was hard for me to see some REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS LEFT OUT.\n\nMy main gripes **(MANY SPOILERS AHEAD)**:\n\n* In the final book, Katniss REALLY struggles with this shit she went through in the first two books.  In the movie, Katniss virtually shows 0 emotion until she goes back to her victor's house in district 12 near the end and sees Buttercup.\n\n* Peeta, on the other hand, was VERY well done this movie.  You could really feel his struggle throughout the entire thing.  We really needed more of that from Katniss.\n\n* They left some REALLY important shit out of the ending.  Like-massively important to wrapping up this story.  It was so rushed.  They could have really cut some stuff from the first movie, moved some of Part II into Part I, and added some more of the ending of the book back into Part II.  \n\n* Katniss is supposed to NEED Peeta, which is a large part of why she chooses him over Gale.  Throughout the movie, I never really felt like she NEEDED him, despite it being VERY apparent that he needed her.  \n\n* I DID like the pods/traps/muts/etc.  I thought that was all VERY well done.  Those things were exactly what I hoped they would be.  \n\n* Moore's Coin was MUCH better in this movie than Part I-and they set her up to be a villain VERY well.  \n\n* Why was the baby at the end so chubby?  I mean-was this the best child they could find to play a young infant?  I'm not #fatshaming-I just don't think that baby looked like the product of the two actors playing Katniss and Peeta (the older child, however, did).  \n\nMy biggest complaint is mainly the rushed ending.  It was just too abridged to make a whole lot of sense.\n\nI didn't have HUGE expectations for this-I wasn't TOO impressed with Part I (though I liked it overall), so I sort of lowered what I expected from this one.

Many of the deaths just felt unfulfilling, and simply made me feel like \"aw man they killed him off before he could really be utilized this movie\" ([spoilers](#s\"Boggs, Jackson, Finnick\")) and [spoilers](#s(\"bringing in Prim out of nowhere just for her to die\") , and while I understand the intended idea, that in wars the loss of loved ones is devastating and unexpected, many of the deaths felt oddly placed.\n\nAdditionally, I also felt that Katniss's character did not actually affect much of the overarching plot (maybe that's what they were intending, that war's are not actually won by individuals), but it seemed that much of the film was Katniss and co. running around on an important mission to kill Snow that ended up not being important to the actual outcome of the war.\nWhile there were many highlights, I personally walked out of the theater feeling uncomfortably unfulfilled by the conclusion to this story of characters I had become so invested in, and considering I had walked in with high expectations", "Before I start my rant, I want to say my issue is, bottom line, that this is part two at all. Cut some from part 1, a bit from part 2, smooth the edges, and this would probably have been better than Catching Fire. But the decision was made to split the movie into two parts, a medium where it just does not work that way. \n\nBoth films needed a beginning, a middle, and an end. With a bit of a change to the plot to accommodate that structure, it could have worked. But I'm judging it as a film on its own, as they chose to release it, and not half of a whole. This movie isn't LOTR, it suffers the way the Hobbit did. When Twilight, of all things, seems like a stunning example of splitting the plot of one book up (film one, characters established, conflict appears, conflict is resolved, film two,characters established, conflict appears, conflict is resolved), you know something is wrong. In MJ2, everything just starts and then goes on rocketing towards the ending as fast as possible. We don't get to establish the characters, though they are in very different places now, the conflict is there, nothing different from before, and the whole thing is just a climax to part 1. Judging it as a film on its own right, it is just a mess.\n\nSplitting Mockingjay was so much worse of an idea in execution than I could have imagined. I like the movies much more than the books, in all honesty, for the changes they make. If something went wrong with the Mockingjays, it was staying too close to the material. \n\nI want to point out that my problem with it wasn't the action, plot, or acting, it's that the movie does not stand on its own. Of course, being a series you need the previous films to understand the plot, but The Hunger Games had its own plot that was introduced and resolved by the end, just leaving an opening for more. Ditto Catching Fire, the best of the four. Mockingjay starts a plot, grinds to a complete stop for a year, then jerks ahead at top speed. \n\nI felt nothing for the characters that die, because they are either introduced abruptly and die before you get to know them, or they do so little in this film before their death that you forget why they matter in the first place. The major death at the end would have worked better if she had done something, anything, in this film. Like, say, everything she'd done in the previous film. And so many characters (Effie, Haymitch, Annie, Prim, Johanna, Cressida, Enobaria, and most understandably Plutarch) feel like cameos than having a purpose (Johanna was REALLY shoehorned in, when imagine if she were there instead of the twins whose names are, well, who the fuck knows). \n\nToo many characters get introduced and thrown away without giving us a reason to care. The propo crew from part one work fine, but Jackson, the twins, and the guy Peeta kills are there and gone too fast for them to feel like they matter. Only Jackson stuck with me. To be fair, this is a complaint I have with the book as well.\n\nUltimately, it feels incomplete. It doesn't have a beginning or middle, it's the climax to another movie. It spends as little time as possible with the rest of the books plot before diving right into the climax. I can't see myself watching it again, at least not without MJ1 immediately before. And it's most likely meant to be seen that way. But this is film, not television, and a year has passed between the release of the first and the second, not a week. It should be able to stand by itself, not require another movie to make its plot coherent. \n\nWatching this, all I could think was \"wow, Breaking Dawn was handled  so much better\" and I felt filthy for thinking that. I'm ashamed I gave them my money opening weekend, because this part one and two bullshit has to be stopped.", "I've decided I hate this series for a few reasons, but mainly it is the leads:\n\n1) Catnip Everclear. All this series ever has ever been and seems to constantly always be is Catnip as a puppet for either evil Donald Sutherland or evil yellow-eyed Julianne Moore. Even when she finally goes out to do something on her own she's still doing the bidding of some faceless adult. And the war has to take a back-seat to this series' themes of endless media manipulation and reality show double-think, to the point that I still don't know if Catnip is acting or not when she loves Peeta. Does even she know?\n\nWhich is weird because Jennifer Lawrence is *horrendous* in this series. I know she can act better than this (American Hustle), but she is blank-faced and summoning her inner Kristin Stewart from the Twilight movies this entire time. What emotion is Lawrence trying to bring to Catnip in every scene? Is that sadness? Is that annoyance? Is that mildly constipation? I have no idea. The scene where she kissed the lesser Hemsworth was the most awkward thing in the world, not only because the dialog was wretched and she somehow missed his lips, but because I don't know what her character was feeling, if anything. Catnip gets to open up once during this movie and it's screaming at a cat. Her final romance validation with Peeta is the most aesexual act of snuggling up to him in bed, and not even kissing. Are you capable of sexual thoughts? Are you capable of anything?\n\n2) Peeta. Peeta is a fucking load and they should have left him to die back in movie one. He has never helped the plot progress and Catnip has been dragging his stupid ineffective ass for four movies now, never worse than here where an exciting war has to take a backseat to babysitting Peeta. Feed him to the Rage Zombies and move on. (Also the Capitol has Rage Zombies? Why didn't they use them earlier?) I fucking hate this kid, and there are some many more likable characters out there. How about that awesome dude with a spear? Or Rampart star, Woody Harrelson? Or the corpse of Academy-Award Winning Act, Philip Seymour Hoffman? Anything is more useful than this loser.\n\nAlso not nearly enough Stanley Tucci. Desperately lacking in the Stanley Tucci department.\n\nAlso was there a lion woman or did I dream that?", "I just got out of it and it was not a bad movie but definitely not a great one.  I'm gonna assume this is mostly because of the book it's based on not being that good.  Some of the scenes were pretty intense especially in the sewers.  The build up being all for nothing was also disappointing.  I'd give it a 7/10.", "So the whole point of the series was 'protect Prim' from page one.. And then she died in a smokey/bad cgi 3 second scene.", "- Overall the movie was okay. The action scenes were great and Jennifer Lawrence was cute. I would have liked to see more of the rebellion fighting the Citadel, and less of Katniss trying to decide whether she loved Peeta or Gale. The overall politics could have been great as well, if it were only fleshed out more.\n- The \"Left 4 Dead\" sewer scene was pretty entertaining. Most of the deaths were pretty entertaining actually. I liked all the traps.\n- It's interesting how they framed the movie. There were tons of anti-government elements, but that was definitely not the focus of the movie. The movie definitely focused entirely on Katniss and her relationships. Throughout most of the movie, the audience doesn't really get to see what the rebel army is doing. Everything is viewed only from Katniss' perspective. All the successes and failures are only in relation to Katniss, so much that you don't really get the sense that the rebel army is winning the war until near the end of the movie. And by that point, Katniss' contribution to the war effort is very questionable. Her goal was to get to the Capital to kill Snow...but did that really help anyone? Katniss' goal was that of revenge, and could be said to be separate from the entire Capital/Rebel war. When the Rebels win at the end, it's so anti-climactic that for a couple minutes you're left wondering if they had won at all, and what the final moments of battle were like. You never see the end of the final battle because Katniss blacks out\n- Peeta/Katniss relationship started off interesting but became boring near the end. Peeta's final line of the movie was very bleh.\n- Like the end of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it felt like this movie ended multiple times. I'm not sure \"drawn out\" is the right term, but by the time the movie ends for real I had lost all emotional attachment to the movie", "As a huge fan of the books, I'm really disappointed in how this film handles the PTSD aspects. The theme of recovery after trauma is the central point of the third book. After [spoiler](/s \"Prim dies\"), Katniss is meant to suffer a complete mental and physical breakdown. Instead, she was just wandering around like nothing had happened. It cheapened her decision to [spoiler](/s \"choose Peeta in the end. If she hasn't hit a low point, how can he help her recover?\"). Also, I feel like JLaw just phoned in her performance. Josh Hutcherson stole the show away from her. ", "This movie has such a anti war tone, I cant believe Fox news isnt  boicoting it", "I'm just glad it's over. Felt like I was taken hostage and was obligated to watch them till the end.", "Did anyone else get the impression James Newton Howard totally phoned it in with the score? Especially compared to the prior films in this series, the score in this one just felt lazy and generic to me. ", "This series gets a lot of shit for the teenage girl pandering and Battle Royale ripoff, but I enjoyed this series a lot. I enjoyed the last movie a lot and yes, people hate the Lawrence circlejerk but I thought she did an incredible job with the emotional aspects of this series. Despite the writing and pacing flaws of the series, it was a good movie.", "Holy fuck was seeing Phillip Seymour Hoffman again really depressing. Movie was ok, but the cgi addition of PSH at the end left a bad taste in my mouth. RIP PSH you were probably the greatest actor I've ever seen and probably the first person in entertainment I have felt as a real loss since he died at his peak not quite a bit after like Mochael Jackson.", "I really loved the books, so much so that I read all three in two days when I first read them.\n\nCatching Fire was probably one of my all-time favorite movies.\n\n\nI can't begin to describe how bored I was during this movie.  There was one cool scene, the climax, and the rest was a snooze fest.  It was offensively bad, to me.\n\nYou could have distilled this movie down to 30-40 minutes, tacked it onto Part 1, and you would have had one real good movie. Instead, you have Part 1, which had all the coolest parts of plot with no resolution, and this movie which drew the series to an end and needed to justify itself by throwing an hour and 45 minutes of boring non-sense before the ending.\n\n\nThis movie was real bad.  I can't believe how they ended this series \u2014 it was legit incredible and it just whimpered out.", "Had to run out of the cinema right after she killed coin, because the last bus that took me home was arriving, could anyone tell me what happened after that?", "Did anyone else agree with President Coin towards the end? As soon as [spoilers](#s \"the parachute bombs dropped over the crowd of children\") I thought \"damn that's a good strategy.\" Then it's \"revealed\" what *really* happened and we're supposed to flip sides. I dunno, I just thought she was a great pragmatist, up until she suggests a new hunger games.\n\nThat being said, the action scenes were well-done, but the script could've used some doctoring. It's really about thirty minutes too long.", "That baby is Asian. Done. I'm out.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in all seriousness, I really enjoyed the way the film was shot and the cinematography was really nice. The underground \"game\" was really intense. Felt like it was a zombie horror flick. The bombing was well done. Not the way I had imagined, but was to the point. \n\nIt seems that I have forgotten most of what was written in the book because I thought the movie was pretty close to the book and fellow friends of mine said \"Hell no!!!\". So ima have to reread it real quick soon. I really enjoyed small bits like Effie and Haymitch (was amusing to see), when Coin was giving that bullshit farewell speech for Katniss on TV and Plutarch is just giving the \" this bitch\" side glance at Coin when she gives that fake cry, and definitely when Katniss shot Coin (was so damn satisfying).\n\n", "It's not the worst in the series, but certainly not the best either ", "The movie felt long to me. I think if it were trimmed by 30 minutes or something it would be stronger to me. \n\nI really hated the jump scares, especially when they all felt like they were all within the same 30 minutes or so. By jump scares, I mean the machine gun ambush, the land mine, and the mutt attack. \n\nFelt like Katniss wasn't portrayed as well in this movie as opposed to the other three movies. A lot of her scenes seemed to lack emotion when it felt like there should, for example the final scene with Gail. There were some good outliers where you can see Katniss's emotions (the train survivor scene comes to mind) but overall Katniss felt robotic almost to me. Maybe that was on purpose, but if it was it feels wrong.\n\nIn contrast, Peeta was portrayed very well. Everything Peeta stood out to me as being really great.", "Just like the previous movie I felt like this one seemed a lot darker than the first two films. The oil(?) scene where the guy gets strung up in the air was disturbing, as well as the sewer chase with the mutts. \n\n It dragged on a bit for me at the end but I understand that they needed to wrap everything up. I had never noticed until now how much I enjoyed the soundtrack, the music complimented a lot of the scenes really well.   ", "That sure was an emotional sendoff. I really loved that these movies don't pull their punches. They've shown that war is brutal and a terrible thing no matter what side you're on. \n\nI'm continually baffled by the mainstream success of these movies. I guess the love triangle stuff has a big YA appeal but these least few movies have really been about Katniss struggling with PTSD. They never feel like action movies at all. They don't revel in the action even though there are action scenes. For the most part the Mockingjay parts 1 and 2 have been really quiet and slow, feeling almost like indie films. \n\nThis movie ranks just below Catching Fire for me, which is the still the strongest of the bunch, but it was a fitting finale to the series. A very somber and sobering ending. ", "I thought this was the best one in the series.\n", "(MAJOR SPOILERS) Probably my main gripe with the film is that instead of the ending focusing on putting an end to tyranny and oppression by killing Coin instead of Snow. It seems to gloss over it and goes back to Peeta and Katniss and their love story making for quite a disappointing ending IMO. Peeta was done very well in this movie rather than just another of Katniss' love interests and the sewer scene was especially exciting. But all the buildup in the middle just seems to all be thrown away by the end of the film.", "I'm not a big Hunger Games person, at all, and only saw this because I went with friends.. but here are a couple things that really stood out to me and were reasons why I didn't like this.\n\n1.  Katniss and Gale know they are going to try and split from the group once they get to the captiol.  They know they are going to be in the middle of a warzone and are going to try and infiltrate the most guarded place in the whole captiol.. so they bring a Bow and arrow and crossbow.. ok.. this really screwed them over later on.\n\n2.  When the get t othe two pillars with giant machine guns they trigger it and then just walk out infront of it to film some propaganda without knowing if they is reserve ammo and it might go off again.. killing them, not only this but they continually say, \"We don't know where the new pods/traps are planted so keep a look out\" but as soon as they trigger this trap they let their guard down which results in 4 of their squad being wiped out almost simultaneously.\n\n3.  After they trigger the oil trap they hold up in the apartment, but when of their members is too injured to move on they just leave them.. instead of maybe boosting them up the next floor so they aren't so trapped on the destroyed staircase, or bring them with them across the courtyard to the nice new cozy loft with shag rugs, couches, and television.  Especially since they say.. \"The Peacekeepers know we are here, they'll be coming any second.\"  They pretty much knew they were going to leave them to be killed and didn't give two shits.  Would it really havev been that hard to carry the injured girl to a safer location.. clearly the peacekeepers didn't realize that the entire squad changed location across the courtyard.\n\n3.  When In the sewers they got their shit fucked up, because dumbass katniss brings nothing but a bow and arrow and doesn't even bring a backup weapon, sure she kills a few of them with the exploding arrows but ultimately she ended up needing to just be resuced.. as she always does.. by everyone else that brought way more practical weapons and ends up getting the best character killed because he had to throw his trident thing to save her.. again.. not only that but after Finn come sin and saves all their asses they just leave him while Pollux has been sitting at the top the entire time and Katniss and Gale basically say F U to Finn as they climb up the ladder and as Finn screams out in agony while being devoured for Katniss because they just left him behind she just gives him the finger and blows him up, gg team.\n\n4.  And now Gale and Katniss are refugees who just got a clean break to make a run for the Capitol building as refugees close in behind and instead of staying undercover as refugees Gale decides to pick up a weapon and blow their cover so he can do absolutely nothing and get captured near instantly, smooth move Gale..\n\nSo ya those are just some things that stick out in my mind and reasons why I didn't like this movie.", "The pacing was so really awful, some scenes dragged on far too long and it felt like they were doing so to justify needing to split it into two separate films. Action was decent, acting was the level you have come to expect. Overall fair enough. 7/10", "Disclaimer: On mobile, forgive my grammar.\n\nI enjoyed the film overall, but I was disappointed due to some of the issues that the Mockingjay story has (in book and movie form.) Namely the end, as someone said before me, makes no sense. I don't understand why Katniss suddenly ends up with Peeta or why she has two kids. Wasn't the whole point that she never wanted to have kids *because* of the life she and her peers had suffered? Adding children to the epilogue makes her character much more standard, and it detracts from that unique female that Katniss portrays throughout the rest of the film. It says \"Hey, here's Katniss and she lives a happy life with her family, just like many other women.\"\n\nAlso, I don't understand the ending with Gale. Gale and Katniss have known each other for their whole lives, and have always protected their families first. Family is priority. Hell, Katniss gives up her own life by volunteering for her sister in the original *The Hunger Games*. Gale continues to protect Katniss' family throughout the entire series, and then at the very end he vanishes, just because he could not protect Prim until the end? In the movie someone literally says \"Who, Gale? Oh he's just a leader in District 2 now.\" I'm not saying that Katniss had to have ended up with Gale instead of Peeta, but there should have at least been a rational conclusion after all the build up with the love triangle.\n\nI suppose these might be critiques more so of the book than the film, but I think they are reasonable nonetheless. I love the plot and the characters of this series, but I felt like they didn't have justifiable conclusions.

And then all these little children are pulled from their parents, and JNH's score in the background is heartbreaking, and then the parachutes fall and you hear the cries of all these hopeful children--\n\nThat was a stand out moment for me, obviously.\n\nThere's so much more to talk about. Let's start with the epilogue--so simple, so why did I never even think of it?! I used to spend a lot of time trying to figure out ways for them to keep that final line in there and I ended up thinking up a complicated one of Katniss writing a letter to Haymitch and her narrating it as she writes it. But this was obviously so much better. And then you can see Katniss's hair is starting to turn gray, too. So much detail! And then that little hug between Peeta and the eldest child is heartwarming. And the final shot is Katniss looking on...cue Deep in the Meadow. Loved it. The Buttercup scene was heartwrenching, too. Jen's acting here was superb (as usual).\n\nI've heard some complaints about Coin's execution being a) too short and b) too expected. I can understand why it would feel too short to some (it's literally exactly that in the book), and I can understand why it was too obvious for some. Yes, you can kind of see how Katniss will handle the situation, and I think the reason most of us were so surprised while reading the book was because we didn't have the visuals to catch on (\"I vote yes for Prim\"). I liked the execution scene and thought they did it well.\n\nI noticed that Katniss never shoots a random Capitol lady. We know they shot the scene so hopefully it will be on the Blu-ray and maybe part of an extended edition?\n\nStand out performances: DONALD SUTHERLAND. He is a genius. His laugh when Coin was shot is perfect and terrifying. Josh did a fabulous job, as usual, but I could really feel Peeta's pain this time around. Jena Malone is fearless as Johanna!

Opening night may have been a mistake.", "A little late, but I caught a showing last night. Lovely little movie - it was preying pretty viciously on nostalgia, but I'm okay with that. For people who are already fond of the Peanuts, this is absolutely in step with the tone and intent of the original series. Things move along a bit quicker to keep audiences involved for ~90min and they did subtly work in a pop song, but none of that strays too far from what you would expect out of a Peanuts movie, and it all works quite well together. There's almost no need to go over what the movie did right, because it just nailed all points already in place - the characters are memorable, the animation and use of child actors kept everything feeling hones, and it was just cute, friendly, and funny. It's an optimistic setting with a wishy-washy loser as a main character, and the adventures all spin outward from that, which I don't think that will ever stop being entertaining and relevant.\n\nI suppose I really only have two issues. One is that the message in the ending came on way too thick for me, and ended up feeling a bit ham-handed. Knowing the Peanuts, I'm sure there was a more subtle way for them to bring that all across. The other is that the movie is very heavy on Charlie Brown and Snoopy after the introductory scenes; while I understand that there needs to be a through-line for a movie, I would've liked for them to take a bit more time showing us interactions between the supporting cast - all of the classic bits were there (Schroder/Lucy, Sally/Linus, Patty/Marcie, etc.), but they only spend a brief moment or two on each.\n\nIt's still everything I was optimistic for - it looks and feels like the Peanuts, it's something that I think even a lot of new fans can appreciate in its earnestness and warmth. It wasn't a fast, constant-laughter ride, but I smiled through the whole thing, and it's hard to fault it for that. Well worth the price of admission; looking forward to catching it again on DVD or at the $2 theater.\n\nOne more thing to note: The two previews and Ice Age short before our showing all had some form of semi-subtle \"balls\" joke in them. The closest thing I believe the Peanuts had to strong language or an innuendo was Snoopy and a poodle making goo-goo eyes at each other.\n\n*EDIT: Used a word that wasn't a word.*", "The animation was beautiful, the story was heartwarming, the characters were just like I remembered and best of all, NO POP SONGS", "Such a cute film.

And, boy, am I glad I did; what a wonderful movie!\n\nI was impressed with how well the filmmakers handled Charlie Brown's story and Snoopy's novel subplot. Even though the story detoured into Snoopy's fantasy world for minutes at a time, I never felt like Charlie's story was diminished by its presence or overshadowed in terms of humor. Considering the relative subject matter of the two plots, I thought the movie did a good job of breaking the subplot into chapters and neatly interweaving it with the main plot. Having the kids serve as unwitting muses for Snoopy not only helped make that blend work, but it was also one of the reasons Charlie's and Snoopy's relationship was very cute in this movie.\n\nI'm still not convinced that this movie needed to be CGI, but nevertheless, the end result was gorgeous and unique. I was also very pleased with the voice acting.\n\nThe funniest sequence in the movie was Snoopy running all through the neighborhood playing pretend while the kids were calling Charlie to tell him what the \"crazy dog\" was up to. I also got a kick out of the entire library sequence, especially \"Leo's Toy Store\".\n\nAbove all, I love how sweet and sincere *The Peanuts Movie* is. All of the laughs are good-natured and cutesy. Sometimes I get the sense that films and (especially) TV try to race to see who can be more meta or snarky, but I think the witty, innocent laughs are harder to get. *The Peanuts Movie* strives for that more endearing level of humor and delivers. And, of course, it's also very heartwarming. It's the newest member in a group of recent gentle and sincerely charming non-Disney family movies, like *Shaun the Sheep Movie* and *Paddington*, and I'm delighted that these types of movies have been on the rise lately. I hope this small trend continues.", "im surprised i liked this so much. i was afraid it would be too old school for new generation and you know what, it is and thats what made it so good. i was so glad that the gang was still smart (red baron, war and peace) and also loved the old school animation mixed with the new. cant wait to add this to the collection.", "This was a wonderful movie filled with nostalgia and great animation.

He's kinda Bugs Bunny meets Dennis the Menace.\n\nWoodstock had never been treated as well as he is in the Red Baron scenes.\n\nThe one character I feel is completely underutilized is Linus. He gets only 1 or 2 blanket gags and his lines just came off as generic. Missed opportunity in Linus.\n\nRerun doesn't exist. He's like Gopher in the Winnie the Pooh movie. Though there is a new character call Little Kid.\n\nAll the characters sound a bit younger than before, as they use actual kids as voice actors.

And there's also a soundtrack that I know not everyone is gonna love, since complaining about pop music is how you show you're smart or something.\n\nLittle Red-Haired Girl is what Charlie Brown ultimately wants. When she speaks in the end, to me she sounds like the audience avatar.\n\nThis movie is so very happy & optimistic. Y'know comedies don't often get the Oscar for best picture.

I said, 'Well, is Mr. Hinx intelligent?' He said, 'Very.' That's what I like about Mr. Hinx. He's very well-dressed and very well-mannered. I'm not just here to fight people. He has a sense of humor. He definitely knows what a metaphor is.\"\n\nThe giant, angry-looking, goatee-sporting, newsboy-cap-rocking, double-barrel-pistol-wielding maniac we see in the new picture, coupled with the quirky name \"Mr. Hinx\" might evoke thoughts of a more conventional, silent type of Bond villain. However, Dave Bautista\u2019s words seem to indicate that this enigmatic ne\u2019er-do-well will be giving Daniel Craig\u2019s James Bond more than a handful in both the physical and psychological arenas, and might even start trading witticisms and puns with the covert cosmopolitan wielder of a license to kill.'\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n'Shit.'\n", "I really cant place exactly why i disliked this movie so much with the exeption of the feeling that nothing ever really happened.

Maybe this was a tribute to when he and his girl were drugged before dining with Dr. No, only to be tortured later. Dr. No was also a member of Spectre so maybe there is something here to acknowledge. ", "My first gripe was with Blofeld. Now he is made out be the villain to rule all villains, yet he felt absolutely no different to any of the other villains we have seen in the Craig era. In fact I would say Silva came across as far more sinister, and far more in control of the whole situation. He got caught out in the end through pure emotion at having to finish M off himself, whereas Blofeld seemed to get caught out through pure incompetence. I will note as well at this stage that Blofeld reveals that M's murder was under his orders. So where does this leave the story with Silva? I won't even go into how much of a cluster fuck that makes Skyfall\u2019s storyline.\n\nI mean the film implies all the previous villains such as White, Le Chiffre and Silva were all in fact his puppets essentially so you then must presume Blofeld would be someone who exercises immense control and understanding of everything. So then how is it he doesn\u2019t even think to remove Bonds watch? We already know at this stage he has MI5 and MI6 completely bugged so he would know that Bond relies on gadgets for when his gun is removed.\n\nIt tried to get around this by saying that Q wanted to set up his lab in a private area where I guess Blofeld can't bug him. But since we know that C is working for Blofeld, then why on earth would he allow Q to do this? He has the authority to refuse such a request.\n\nGoing back to Blofelds incompetence, he wants to see Bond die in the building at the end, he lays out Bonds route to the girl (so we know he's planned this all out clearly), yet he leaves a speedboat with keys in it at the bottom of said route? This just really makes it hard to see Blofeld as the person the film implies he is. The film seemed to be chock full of these conveniences to bridge a weak story.\n\nAnother bizarre aspect was with Hinx. The scene at the start of the film in which Hinx takes over as Bonds pursuer (which was a great scene) sets things up nicely in terms of we know that Blofeld needs this man to bring Bond in for him. Bond then has a very exciting fight with him on the train (another good scene but with a silly ending) and beats him. Yet we then see Bond willingly get into a car and be driven to Blofeld's camp. Does this not render Hinx's character irrelevant to the film? His sole purpose was to bring Bond in, yet the whole time Bond was willing to go without so much as a struggle. Bond could have easily taken the drivers car to flee, so this dispels any ideas that Bond felt he had no choice but to go.\n\nThe love story also felt very rushed. In Casino Royale it dedicated good screen time to the budding romance of Bond and Vesper, yet in this it felt like they decided they wanted a new love story but without the hassle of any real character building between the two. Yes they are on screen together a lot but it's mainly in action sequences. It seems to go that Bond saves her life, so she suddenly wants to get in bed with him (understandable) and after that she is in love with him. Lazy writing.\n\nC was also a bad casting choice with Andrew Scott. Anyone who has seen Sherlock (which is a lot of people, especially Brits) knew exactly what his character would end up being revealed as. Maybe it was obvious to everyone anyway, but then this makes that element of the story boring as the reveal comes as no surprise at all.\n\nAlso, what did having Bond and Blofeld being revealed as brothers as sort add to the story? All I could think is how much of a stretch it was that this man's son had grown up to be the world\u2019s most powerful villain and his adopted son had grown up to be the world\u2019s greatest spy. I don't see how Bond would not be able to remember him from this period in his life as well. Blofeld's dad supposedly made Bond the man he is and Bond spent two solid years living with Blofeld. He couldn't even remember him after seeing a photo of him that was not only taken from that time period, but taken with Bond stood a metre away from him!\n\nIt felt like you just had to accept so much of the film as fact with little to no explanation. I mean how could this weedy, softly spoken, largely incompetent man become the leader of all the world\u2019s most feared villains? We just have to accept he has with no explanation. Again very lazy film making.\n\nI apologise if this read as a rant because it was not intended as one. I came to this sub as I know I will get better responses than \"ahh it's a Bond film you're not meant to take it seriously, just switch your brain off for 2.5 hours!\u201d\n\nWe know Mendes is a solid director and we know what he is capable of so I am not happy to accept simply ignoring all the flaws because it's a Bond film. That doesn't give it a free pass for me.\n\n ", "I really hope the cat lived", "The pacing felt... off. A lot of really slow scenes punctuated by really brief action sequences. Hinx went too soon!", "Having watched Game of Thrones, the Dave Bautista eye gouge scene was like a kids movie. ", "Sorry. This one will be long.\n\nFirst, the good things: I really enjoyed the pre-titles sequence, and I loved all of the kinetic crowd movement and explosions of colour of El Dia de los Muertos. The action overall is decent but the PTS was the best by far. I thought Sam Smith\u2019s song improved considerably when played over the hentai-tastic title sequence (and I got a kick out of seeing Vesper and Le Chiffre again in the titles). The MI6 gang of M, Q, Moneypenny, and Tanner got some more things to do this time around (they also got some of the best one-liners) and that was pretty cool, although by the end they were starting to remind me of Ethan Hunt\u2019s entourage of helpers in all of the *Mission Impossible* movies. I absolutely loved Dave Bautista\u2019s Hinx (great fight on the train with Bond) and I wish we got more of him. The lobotomy scene was fascinating, although I think it would have been more effective if Bond had actually suffered some adverse effects because of it. There were a bunch of subtle nods to Ian Fleming\u2019s original stories, like the Hildebrand safe house, which brought me untold amounts of joy as a Bond fan.\n\nUnfortunately there was also quite a bit about *SPECTRE* which did not wow me. I think I\u2019ll have to see the film a few more times before I can comfortably rank it somewhere against the other Bond films, but right now it doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to the greats like *Casino Royale*, *From Russia With Love*, and *GoldenEye* (in my opinion). \n\nOne of my biggest issues with this film is the incredibly unconvincing and contrived romance between Bond and Dr Madeleine Swann (played by one of my favourite young actresses, the gorgeous Lea Seydoux). The film insists that she is **The Love of Bond\u2019s Life** (which apparently transpired over the course of a few days of travel) and it weakens what would have otherwise been a somewhat interesting character; there\u2019s a lot they could have done with her being a psychologist and the daughter of Mr White. Though Seydoux did a decent job with what she was given, the character of Madeleine was inconsistently written; the \u201cI love you\u201d had me laughing and then it had me a bit cross because it seemed like barely ten minutes ago that she had been sarcastically pointing out the idiocy of falling into Bond\u2019s arms. In any case, I still hold the relationship between James Bond and Vesper Lynd as the gold standard for romance in a Bond movie, and not only does *SPECTRE* openly invite comparisons to that relationship (both by mentioning Vesper and by practically duplicating certain scenes from CR) but there\u2019s nothing between Bond and Madeleine that even comes close to the emotional depth of \u2013 for instance \u2013 the shower scene from *Casino Royale* in this movie.\n\nI was also quite disappointed with the other members of the supporting cast (minus Bautista and the MI6 team), whom I think I expected more from given the talent involved. Monica Bellucci looks great as always but she\u2019s in this movie for maybe five minutes and then never seen or mentioned again; it really made all those claims of the series breaking ageist barriers in Hollywood seem laughable in retrospect. Andrew Scott phoned it in and portrayed the most generic villainous bureaucrat I have had the misfortune of seeing in recent memory, and I can only pray that with his (hopefully) hefty *SPECTRE* paycheck, he can be free to do work he actually gives a shit about for the next decade or so. Denbigh is basically in this movie so Ralph Fiennes\u2019 M can be a total badass, which is okay but also a complete waste of the very talented Andrew Scott.\n\nAnd of course, the Nehru jacket-wearing elephant in the room: Christoph Waltz, as Franz Oberhau- hahaha nope he\u2019s actually Blofeld because daddy issues. I\u2019ve probably experienced more surprise waiting for electronics that I ordered off AliExpress than I did with the so-called twist in this film. The movie attempts to leave you astonished with the Oberhauser/Blofeld switcheroo and the reveal that Blofeld orchestrated essentially everything bad that happened to Bond in the previous three films, but it feels more like a bunch of strategic name-dropping exposition (a Le Chiffre here, a Silva there) than a mindfuck of epic proportions, and it\u2019s not helped by the fact we already heard him say \u201cThe author of all your pain\u201d in the theatrical trailer. Waltz isn\u2019t *bad* per se but he comes across as a watered-down Hans Landa rather than something refreshingly original, and it\u2019s nothing to write home about in terms of Christoph Waltz performances, or even Bond villain performances in general. It just feels like something we\u2019ve seen done before, but not quite as good as when we saw it done the first time \u2013 which incidentally is how a lot of this film feels.\n\nOverall, after this first viewing, I would give *SPECTRE* a 5/10 \u2013 maybe a weak 6 if I\u2019m generous. I liked many things about the movie, but its cons (mainly to do with the romance subplot and the wasted or underwhelming supporting cast) sadly outweigh its pros. I\u2019ll be watching it a few more times in the coming weeks and I hope it improves for me upon rewatch \u2013 but for now, I consider it a very middling film.\n\nP.S. I miss Martin Campbell.\n\n", "So disappointed in Christopher Waltz. Easily my most anticipated part of the movie and he just.... didn't do much. Waltz himself did fine, I guess, but it was just not an interesting part. Such a shame.\n\nEdit: Now that I think about it, with Andrew Scott, Bautista, and Monica Bellucci also, there was a lot of wasted potential in this movie. Maybe that was my biggest issue with it.", "I think this movie had a lot of issues, but I think the biggest issue it has, and the thing that's caused the polarization of love/hate for this movie, is the clear tonal shift between the first three Daniel Craig films, and this one.\n\nCasino Royale very clearly demarcates itself and the films that follow from the rest of the Bond filmography, not only by being a reboot of the character (Bond gets his 00 status at the outset of the film), but also of the whole idea of what Bond movies are (Bond's sneering response as to how he'd prefer his martini is a good example of this). \n\nIt seems as if, at the end of Skyfall, we are finally getting set up for the first Bond movie where everything is established, we have our Q, our Moneypenny, more familar characters who again deviate from the tropes to which they are associated. Q chides Bond for expecting an exploding pen; Moneypenny isn't just a subservient secretary with whom Bond flirts, but a former field agent with her own personal issues.\n\nSpectre works feverishly hard to undo every bit of work the first three films did to make \"new Bond\" distinct from what came before. Q shows up with gadgets and deus ex machina escape routes, Moneypenny is \"out in the field\" again in the latter half of the film, but literally does nothing save follow the other members of the Bond-Squad around.\n\nA love story that is completely unearned, a mute henchman, a lackluster car chase, and a villain whose \"real\" name should mean nothing of any dramatic weight to anyone except the audience, whose motivations are foolish. A villain who has been hamfistedly engineered by Spectre's writers to have been behind a lot of things that it makes no sense for him to have been behind (certainly Silva wasn't just being an obedient dog in Skyfall? Javier Bardem certainly didn't play him that way.)\n\nI can see why people would like this movie. If this had followed Die Another Day or even License to Kill, it might have been viewed a lot more positively. But, similarly to The Dark Knight Rises, Spectre had a lot of people expecting it to be something very different because how the bar was raised by what came before it. A lot of people (myself included) liked the new Bond that showed up in Casino Royale and Skyfall (and to a lesser extent Quantum of Solace), and those people are quite understandably upset by what they view to be a clumsy backwards step. \n\nThis is especially frustrating given what they had to work with: one of the best Bonds, if not the best; a great supporting cast (Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Ralph Fiennes, Dave Bautista, even Andrew Scott) and the best possible choice of actor for a main villain in Christoph Waltz.\n\nI hope they give Daniel Craig a better send-off than this would have been.", "Christoph Waltz was such a good villan in IB and he had the perfect role to send chills down our spines once again. However, the writers didn't take full advantage of his talent. They hardly gave him any meaty lines that made the audience seriously cringe. Javier had a monologue about rats in Skyfall that worked ridiculously well. I was hoping for at least some slow, ruthless throat-slitting or of the silent killer kind in this film. Franz's motivation sucked and it's never convincing enough for a villain to spend an enormous time obsessing over one target just for the sake of doing so. It made the level of tension between Franz and Bond disappointing when the actually met. Also, comparing the post-fight scenes between Madeleine and Vesper from Casino Royale, Vesper's trauma scene in the shower was way more believable than Madeleine's \"let's bang\" mental state. Overall, action was cool but the writing was definitely compromised - maybe because the ending needed to somehow set up for the next movie.", "It feels like this is what Quantum wanted to be before the writers strike. Solid film but I agree with most others. In terms of threat level Mr. Hinx was more intimidating that Blofield. \n\nAlso, Lea Seydoux... meowwwww\n\n(EDIT: Also any Blood Stone fans in here? That game plays directly into this.)", "What I didn't like about the movie is that it's held together by 2 magic bullets; one blows up SPECTRE headquarters when it hits a gas line, the other from a PP7 from 300 metres away shoots down a helicopter. Other than that it was a Bond movie.", "fyi, we never saw how 009 looks like", "I'm quite curious about whether or not Silva was originally written to be connected to Spectre (or Quantum as it was called then).

I am going to walk off with this girl I met 2 days ago, because I love her.\" Fuck this movie. Fuck that helicopter pilot who couldn't stop spinning the helicopter he was in full control of for 4 minutes. Fuck. ", "Craig's movies were usually more grounded in reality. This felt almost like a cartoon in certain places, like going back to Peirce Brosnan and his Bond movies. I don't really understand this decision, I thought people generally liked more believable Bond.  ", "I flipped my shit when the gun barrel sequence happened. \n", "Late, I know. Here's my review:\n\nIt's time to put Daniel Craig's Bond to rest.\n\nWhen Casino Royale came out in 2006, it was a big reboot for the James Bond character. It was gritty, it was a spectacle, and it was fresh. It was fresh because a lot of those tropes that Bond was known for were thrown out the window - he could get hurt, he could bleed, he could actually lose the girl, and he didn't wear a tux well. He was fallible, and that is an important quality in an action star. It's what made movies like Lethal Weapon and Die Hard so successful. Casino Royale took James Bond back to where we needed him to be. Spectre has officially wiped that all away.\n\nBond is now back to being an emotionless, invincible super human, one who can fire one bullet and destroy an entire complex while simultaneously turning to kill several enemies without batting an eye. Women are back to being powerless damsels in distress, designed only to bow to our agent's sexual whims. In 2015, James Bond has become...boring.\n\nSpectre has a few good action set pieces, but the more you think about them, the stupider they seem. In one scene, Bond chases after a car with an airplane. His plan? Who knows. Hell, we even get an Austin Powers like scene in which our main villain straps Bond to a chair and points high tech drills at his eyes, promising to create holes into his head - a far cry from a similar scene in Casino Royale in which Le Chiffre straps Bond to a chair and swung at his balls with a wet knotted rope. I can't say much more without spoiling a ton, but if you even attempt to think about nearly every scene in this movie, it seems more lazy and more idiotic.\n\nThe last thing that bothered me in Spectre was the shoehorned sex scenes. YES, we get it - Bond is a suave British agent. Unfortunately, we're force fed this from the moment the movie kicks off. We get a quick glance at Monica Bellucci (criminally underused in this movie) - a grieving wife - who proceeds to be seduced by Bond the very same day her husband was buried. He knows she has assassins after her, but after he nails her, he bails. Later, we get another eye roll inducing scene in which he beds another lass - but this time, it's different. This time, he's magically in love...only, it doesn't work, because of the bullshit we've seen Bond pull throughout the movie. Now we're supposed to care about his muse? Now it matters?\n\nThere are some good things about the movie. Sam Smith's song is pretty good. The cinematography is pretty great. The opening scene in Mexico at a Day of the Dead festival is breathtaking - the logistics needed to pull it off must have been mind bending - but again, it ends in a way that just makes absolutely no sense.\n\nAt this point, I'm only guessing that Craig is done as Bond. As much as I love Casino Royale and Skyfall, I think it's time to move on to someone else and take this ship in a different direction. Lets bring Bond back down to Earth.\n\nFinal Score: C-", "Well I liked it. \n\nIt's basically Craig's \"overdue\" (depending on how you've felt about his era so far) traditional Bond formula film. All the tropes are in place, but now with the style of Craig's era. I'm not surprised it has a mixed response so far given that the mix of Craig's style and traditional Bond is a very odd one, but I enjoyed it on its own terms. Certainly not as great as *Casino Royale* and *Skyfall*, and definitely clunky in certain areas (weird how this is the longest Bond film but feels way too short) but a worthy entry into the Bond canon that I'll happily rewatch over the next several years. If this and *Quantum of Solace* are Craig's worst well then good on him for having a pretty great run compared to the rest. \n\n**Additional thoughts**\n\n* That opening is great. I thought they might have oversold it in the trailers but hoo boy it plays even better, especially over Newman's repurposed *Skyfall* score. \n\n* I thought Smith's theme played a little better over Kleinman's main titles (which as expected were great), but it's still probably the most boring Bond theme they've had.\n\n* If I have one major disappointment it's how small SPECTRE seems to end up being. Granted, they leave it open for the organization to appear again, but considering all the hype I thought there would have been a little more of it than just a meeting room and then Blofeld's base\n\n* As silly as the Blofeld reveal is, at least it doesn't come off as stupid as Khan in *Star Trek Into Darkness*.\n\n* So I guess now that Silva has been retconned into being a SPECTRE member that means *Skyfall* really isn't a standalone film at all.\n\n* Some really nice Bond fan shout outs in this, and they really weren't as obnoxious as I heard. \"Hildebrand\" was cute. ", "Did anyone else feel like they were watching a Mission Impossible movie at the end instead of a James Bond movie? It wasn't bad, but it seemed wrong.", "This movie could honestly be re-titled John Logan's 'A Series of Fortune Events'.\n\nThere's a gag at the beginning that has Bond fall onto a couch as a building falls apart around him. It's a fun gag but it's actually symbolic of every critical plot point in the film. At every turn beyond the opening sequence, Bond and the other protagonists have a tremendous amount of luck.\n\n*  Bond gets recognized at the secret Spectre meeting but fortunately only Mr. Hinx goes to chase him. Bond doesn't escape due to outwitting or outdriving Mr. Hinx, but literally flips random switches in his car like Deedee pressing buttons in Dexter's Laboratory until he ejects and escapes. (Side note: Why write 'Air' instead of 'Eject' on the goddamned Eject switch, other than to be as ambiguous as possible for audiences? Shit, what if the spy is driving an untrained passenger around and they want to put on the Air Conditioning and misunderstands the switch because of the label?)\n* When Bond is chasing three cars from an airplane and manages to completely wreck the wings of his plane, Bond loses all ability to steer and can only accelerate forward. If you're driving or riding in these chased cars, you fucking see this and go \"Hah, that plane is fucked, we got away with the girl! Lets wait for that plane to stop or crash and we can get Bond too.\" Nope, instead the cars fucking turn into the accelerating path of the crippled plane just to be T-Boned through a lumber mill. Jesus fucking Christ.\n* Bond makes his way to L'Americain, rummages around a bit looking for a hidden stash or door, then just gives up and decides to watch over Swann as she sleeps. Thankfully a rat appears, likely disappointed in Bond, to show him where to really look to keep the plot moving.\n* Bond and Swann then take a train to go get purposely captured by Oberhauser, even though Bond is attacked on the train by Mr. Hinx. Bond basically loses the fight but thankfully Swann has some shooting skills and saves the both of them from being captured or killed by Oberhauser while riding a train to go get captured or killed by Oberhauser. Since Hinx is dead, doesn't that mean another super secret Spectre meeting to replace him? Nah, let's stick to the plan.\n* Shockingly, Bond and Swann find themselves captured by Oberhauser who reveals himself to be Blofeld. Fortunately for Bond, Bond's torture table includes a mechanism that brings his hands close together and behind him, just enough for him to fiddle with his watch (actually, really just take off his watch) out-of-sight and work to blow up the torture chamber. Thankfully Q's innuendo really did mean that the watch blows up and just doesn't get extremely loud when the alarm goes off.\n* Also fortunately, Blofeld's entire compound apparently has a thermal exhaust port that leads directly into the reactor system. I guess Bond used the Force and the base exploded right after getting away with Swann. Sorry Mr. Bigglesworth - I guess it's possible you're a hairless cat now, as this movie is starting to resemble Dr. Evil's origin story from Goldmember.\n* Back in London, Swann decides to say goodbye to Bond, because Bond \"isn't going to change.\" Shockingly, Swann gets captured seconds later because Bond wasn't fucking finished doing his job yet and forgot that taking a city stroll would be a bad idea. Blofeld is remarkably busy over the course of this same evening setting up a Bond-themed haunted house with the fortunately-captured Swann as the centerpiece. Bond finds her, saves her, falls down a huge hole into the conveniently placed safety net, finds a boat and thrusts full speed out of the explosion.\n* As luck would have it, Blofeld's helicopter is leisurely flying over that same river at shooting distance from Bond's boat. Bond shoots the copter until its HP reaches 0, and then the copter crashes onto London Bridge. Blofeld, ripe for the shooting and for all the protagonists to show up simultaneously, tells Bond to just finish the movie already. Bond shoots to kill... any ending where Swann might leave him, and proceeds to go and chill with his new squeeze. The British Justice System will take it from here, boys.

The whole movie felt hallow somehow. The opening scene was visually awesome, but they just kinda left that girl hanging, though I suppose that didn't matter. The Monica Bellucci bit was kinda strange. What happened to her after? Did she get to America? Did she get killed? Who knows. The meeting scene in Rome was very good. Batista was cool, reminded me of Jaws, although I wish he had a few more lines than just the one at the end. He was just kinda walking muscle. Christoph Waltz was pretty good, although he really only appeared towards the end of the movie. He should have been in it more, honestly. The whole surveillance NSA plot was pretty alright, although C was pretty obviously an evil bastard and you knew where that whole thing was going. It was nice that they tied the whole thing together with Quantum. The scene with Mr. White was cool, at least that whole thing finally ended that subplot. I liked Leah Seydoux a lot, she was a good Bond girl. She got kidnapped a few times but overall I liked her character. The torture scene was unsettling, but not as good as Casino. It just kinda felt like a lot of running around and grasping at nothing. They didn't really go to crazy locations, just Mexico City, London, Rome and Algeria.

By the far the campiest of the Craig films but still not too campy. Check it out in IMAX if possible, the sound is incredible.

Bond's visit to White's hideaway, for instance. (Also, Bond saw the cameras and he saw the underground camera room. Why in the actual fuck did he not even try to dispose of them to keep Spectre off of his back?)\n\nThe movie felt like it was just hitting a lot of action movie basics. Everything about David Bautistas character was especially guilty of this. His Joker-like murder of that random guy during the meeting (why tf did that even happen?

Completely unconvincing especially since she changes his character by the end. I thought the whole point of the Craig reboot was that he WAS a guy with flaws. I had been pretty disappointed throughout the whole movie, but I thought it might have been redeemed if Bond just blew Blofield's brains out at the end with no hesitation. That's who his Bond is; that's who he's been for 3.5 movies. But nope it all changes over a weekend spent with a blonde doctor!

But if we're trying to go the route of the 21st century Bond, as Skyfall and Casino Royale did, Spectre is just confused. Personally, I feel the audience has gotten used to the brooding Daniel Craig bond, and this mix of old-timey Bond wasn't subtle enough to be pulled off. \n\nThere were also far too many characters who didn't have enough time on screen.\n\n I was so much more creeped out by Silva than I was by Blofeld.This is like the culmination of everything bad every happening to Bond and all we get was, \"yeah dad liked you more.\" There was no development and his character was just not fleshed out well. \n\nAlso, did the drills in Bond's head just not work?

I am in the later camp. I will straight up acknowledge that this film is on a critical level worse than Skyfall, but I just find myself enjoying it so much more. It's got that 4th Bond film charm: bloated, silly, tonally all over the place, super expensive, and lots of fun action set-pieces. Seeing them go back to a lot of iconic Bond set-pieces like a train fight with a henchman, Spectre meetings ending in death, alpine shootouts, and a Bond with a snarky sense of humor was such a delight. \n\nUnfortunately though this film decides to ape two of the most iconic Bond films and in doing so doesn't live up to either. The first is You Only Live Twice, obvious by the direct Blofeld scar and attitude connection. While Waltz is a better actor his character is unfortunately saddled with the worst of modern blockbuster cliches of forcing a connection to the hero that makes the villain too whiny and unintimating at times. Not to mention the whole Blofeld angle felt more like a setup for a long running protagonist than a satisfying villain arc. The other flaw is they tried to redo the romance from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Noble but ultimately a failure because Swan can't hold a candle to tracy. No fault to Lea, just not a very well written character.\n\nUltimately this film will probably piss off many and fight a few scattered but appreciative fans.

", "I'm going to ignore some of the more obvious stuff like Bond's ridiculous marksmanship, his ability to shrug off heinous injury with no permanent effect, and stuff blowing up for no reason.  That's just Normal Bond Stuff, though we've certainly got more of it here than in any of Craig's other films.\n\nI do have some concerns, though:\n\n* Andrew Scott feels typecast here, and plays like a very relaxed version of his [Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29) character.  (Several people in the the theater cheered when he first walked onto camera.)  His plot arc didn't seem to surprise anybody.\n\n* The villain's claim to be behind the plot of the previous three films feels flimsy at best.  LeChiffre?  Okay, I guess the organization could have been his creditors.  Quantum?  Sure, it's been seven years and I *still* don't know what the hell that was about.  **Silva?**  *No, fuck you, shut up.*  Silva was a rogue agent with a clearly-defined backstory and discernible goals, if a somewhat convoluted methodology.  He didn't *need* the support of an evil shadow group, and that's what makes his film better than this one.\n\n* The things Q does make even less sense than last time.  Does his magic laptop scanner read fingerprints or DNA?  If the former, surely it wouldn't work given how so many people have worn and handled the object.  If the latter, how is it sampled?  Either way, are we really expected to believe that it could be tied to every important Craig enemy like that?  Just this one individual trinket that everybody in the group seems to have a copy of?  \n\n* Likewise, Q's hacking towards the end of the film.  Hack *what* exactly?  Are you a member of this project, and do you have any idea how it works?  Even if there was some kind of, I don't know, \"command and control server\" that you could remote-wipe, so what?  All the satellites are still there.  All the cameras are still everywhere.  All the hardware's still perfectly intact and cold backups are a thing that exist.  And the bad guys were able to spy on the good guys perfectly even without this stupid system being booted up.  Q accomplishes nothing.\n\n* Likewise, the villain organization.  Great, you got the boss!  There's a number two.  There's always a number two, and the group is apparently a huge global network.  This is not the time to be driving off into the sunset.\n\n* So... was all that agency political stuff undone by the final battle?  Do Bond and company have any evidence to justify their apparent rampage after they got downsized?  I doubt they'll get it from their prisoner.\n\nIn summary, was there a plan here?  Or are we just blowing stuff up on our way to the next movie?", "Oh darn my henchmen failed to kill you.  Guess I'll just send a car to pick you up so you can look at my meteorite.", "Spectre confirmed to me that I'd simply rather see a Marin Campbell-directed Bond than a Sam Mendes one.", "For me, worst was that the part where villain reveals his new name as Blofeld, was just a throwaway dialogue.

It makes no sense.", "Changing editors is the invisible change no one is talking about that killed this movie. The film just kind of farted along.", "It was fun, just not as good as Skyfall. I think the largest error was how thin Christoph Waltz' character was. He didn't have much to add to the movie and his motivations were incredibly underwritten, which really dulled the impact his character was supposed to have (considering he manipulated all the events in the last 3 films).\n\nThis also forced Christoph Waltz to effectively just play Hans Landa again with about half the charisma. Complete with the condescending tone and wild abrupt laughter.", "My thoughts after walking out of the theatre:\n\n**Opening sequence**\n\nIt's a fantastic sequence, probably the best in the film, but here's my problem with it: it takes place *in the first 15 minutes*. It left me wondering how it could be topped, and I was disappointed that it never was. In fact, I found most of the action sequences in Spectre to be mediocre at best. That doesn't bode well for a Bond film. I would have liked to see this production value applied later, when it could have had some real stakes.\n\n\n**Character**\n\nI really like what Spectre was trying to accomplish with Bond's character, but I never felt like it hit the mark in its execution. M's death at the end of Skyfall left Bond at a low point. Not only, as Blofeld points out, has Bond lost every potential love interest up to this point, he's lost M too.\n\nI was excited to see the film delve deeper into Bond's inner struggles\u2014coping with his loss, his anger (he lashes out at Mr. White, uncharacteristically), and his growing disillusionment with his line of work. He is repeatedly referred to as an assassin\u2014not a spy, but a killer. I loved the brief scene in which Swann questions his feelings toward his job and we see Bond's usual suave persona slip just a little.\n\nI would have liked to see more of this dynamic between them, and this brings me to my main criticism of the film: underdeveloped characters. Apparently these two had a lot of time\u2014I can only assume trekking through the desert\u2014to build a relationship, but we never saw any of it on screen. In what seemed like 20 minutes of screen time Swann goes from threatening to kill Bond to falling in love with him (that's a little quick, even for Bond). Usually I would pin this on a glut of action, but this film had a surprising amount of slow moments \u2014 enough time to properly develop relationships and make me care about these characters. However, it seemed like more time was spent on shots of Bond crossing lakes or standing in the desert waiting for a ride (since when does Bond wait for rides, anyway?).\n\nI feel that Spectre should have been centered around Bond's relationship with two characters: Swann and Blofeld. And it is, to some degree, but there's so much fluff there. Especially the majority of the scenes in London when Bond is absent. Moriarty from Shelock seems to only serve as token bad guy for the secondary characters to deal with. Also, Moneypenny \u2014 what is your job exactly?\n\nOn to Blofeld. I absolutely loved Waltz's performance and honestly I don't remember most of what his character said because I was too busy watching him act. Is that a bad thing? That said, I feel there was this simmering darker side of him that we barely saw emerge. Again, his character could have used more background and more time to develop. I never understood what his motives were to **a)** create this huge surveillance network, and **b)** fuck with Bond so much.\n\n\n**Rearranging things**\n\nStart the film with Bond crossing the lake to find Mr. White. A shot of the house, then a boat approaching in the distance, then only shots of Bond waist-down until he sits down with Mr. White. Then we get to see his face. Of course we all know who it is, but this scene would work so well as a cold (hehe) open. Bond takes White's old Spectre ring and the photo of him and his daughter, closes the door, and we smash cut to the Spectre logo.\n\nMany of the scenes before Mr. White are inconsequential or could work better later. Now Bond is back in London, being reprimanded for doing his own thing again and he makes up some bullshit excuse. We learn he was really following up on previous-M's final message \u2014 which we get to see when he shares with Moneypenny (cause she's all curious what he was *really* doing). Oh, and M doesn't give him some cryptic instruction to kill a dude and then attend his funeral. She tells him straight up to find Mr. White and we cut out all that nonsense in Mexico.\n\nNow Bond can go find White's daughter (and we can have the whole \"smart blood\" thing with Q, why not). And then events progress as normal, until the discovery of the secret room in the hotel. Instead of the location of the Blofeld's secret crater base, they find information that would lead Bond to the Spectre meeting (because how the hell did he find that super secret Spectre meeting in the first place?).\n\n<Insert Moriarty being a little bitch back in London.>\n\nWhile in the building where the meeting takes place, Bond stumbles across another clue on the trail to Blofeld's HQ (which Blofeld gives away on purpose, to lure Bond), then we get the whole meeting scene, and Bond's escape from the building (which I hope is longer and more harrowing).\n\nAfter the car chase, Bond returns to the hotel room where Swann has been waiting (which is in the same country as the meeting because we don't need fifteen different locations).

Then we can have a better chase sequence in Mexico where we actually know and care about what's going on. It could end with Bond interrogating some Spectre guy in the helicopter before letting him plunge to his death (assassin much, Bond?), but not before revealing the location of Blofeld's base, where they proceed as before, but now Bond and Swann can sensibly bang, seeing as they've had so much character development.\n\nHonestly I think they nailed the important character bits in the finale, especially Bond's decision to spare Blofeld (but it should come back to bite him in the next one).

Franz being responsible for Vesper and M's deaths and the villains of the other movies?

The ambiance and atmosphere to that scene was also terrific. \n\nTo me, the movie lacked storytelling. It felt like Bond knew what was going on but the movie didn't clue you in to any of it. Go here, see him, do this, do that, but it didn't really make sense to me. It all felt to convoluted, complicated, and unrealistic. Too much \"destiny\" in the film. I liked how Blofelt was the reason to Bond's troubles but it didn't feel quite possible. \n\nThe action scenes were immense. Just loony enough to be Bond but not too far-fetched to be ridiculous. Jaws' screen presence was great and he didn't feel like a generic henchman at all. \n\nIn the end, I enjoyed watching the film but I didn't \"like\" it. Same as how I felt about Jurassic World.

When approaching a Bond movie and defining what it needs to bring in terms of style and story some things should be considered such as where is the franchise in terms of who is playing 007 and where is that characters story? This movie lacked the sense of identity that Skyfall had. Skyfall had a sense of finality and closure because M (Judy Dench) Died, We got a larger glimpse into James's past, and it was the 3rd Craig installment and American movie goer's are programmed to put their minds into closing mode when we hit that trilogy level. This movie was the 4th which threw people off and the general audiences didn't know what it was bringing except for more mystery into Bond's past. There has been some talk about Craig hanging up the suits and being done with the franchise but nothing is official so we didn't know how to contextualize the ending. That lack of identity did hurt the film but not enough that warrants the trash talk. This was a very well put together film. It was shot beautifully and had a lot of style. There was a nearly 5 minute tracking shot at the start and the opening sequence was executed perfectly. There was enough humor sprinkled through and the action was over the top but not on a Fast and Furious level. People have complained about the pacing but I felt that it was perfect for a slow burning spy movie. I can't stress enough that this is not a Fast and Furious movie. This was a well put together Bond film that paid Homage to the Franchises previous installments.    ", "Finished it for first time, it was so boring that i watched it in like 8 parts.

Biggest problem was that it was just boring as fuck.", "This just in: **EU sues MGM. \"Spectre plagiarizes European Commission\".**", "Great opening shot that the rest of the film didn't quite live up to and the white cat was a total giveaway regarding the big reveal. The battle against the main henchman on the train, been there, done that, more enjoyable when Jaws was the Big Bad. Yeah, not one of the better Bond films.", "I'm still really stuck on: \n\n1. how Hinx got on the train? They'd been riding for a full day before he decides to attack them in the dinner car. Why not in their rooms? Or wait to surprise them when they were asleep? \n\n2.Why the fuck go to all the trouble of the spray painted arrows and photos of old villains when Bond was supposed to be blindfolded? I don't think the intention was for him to murder his captors. How could Blofeld be sure that Bond wasn't going to leave the area? Why make him walk that whole way? Was he going to leave the captors to die as well if they had delivered Bond to the other side of the bulletproof glass?\n\nI can't stop thinking about these two things and its really bothering me. \n\n", "M: \"Was getting caught part of your plan?\"\n\nBlofeld: \"Oooh.

Looking back Silva's plan made no sense what so ever, but he did hold a better presence as a villan than Waltz.\n\nI'm probably in the minority, but I enjoyed Quantum of Solace, the opera scene was especially a highlight. This movie had great sequences too, the opening was the definition of bond awesomeness.

Well I just got to see 2 supercars cruising the streets of Rome \ud83d\ude02\n\nThat was literally the lamest and most boring car pursuit I've ever seen. Seriously they've used us to higher standard what happened? I assume the cars were too expensive and they couldn't afford to do a crazy pursuit and to destroy a hundred of them? \n\nBesides that major turn off if I may say, the whole the movie was on the same note, boring. The plot is lame, no suspense, really bad written. When James and the girl head out to that base in a desert and purposely turn themselves in, what was that? Then they just capture him, it's ridiculous. And when they torturing him the girl comes to him and just tell him I love you out of the blue with any background or history to motive it. I mean since they met, she has been mean that him and shared no \"moments\" that could have built any hypothetical sentiment. Really bad written it's a shame. That movie is the worst bond ever and one of the worst movie in general I ever watched. ", "What the hell was the place in the crater built out of? Dynamite??", "First, what I loved: \n\n*The opening was amazing, the continuous shot over bond as he moved through the streets and hotel was exciting and a marvel to look at, and to listen to. \n\n*The action, of course. The shooting, the driving, and fighting. I love it all. To me these more ambitious action scenes are a step in the right action. \n\n* M, Q, and Moneypenny working as a team, as Bond's side kicks. True side kicks. I really like this concept and it's worked well in the past two films.\n\nNow what I hate, really just one thing: \n\n*    The story. Especially in this film, but also in Skyfall. I think this new focus on James and his past is going to kill the franchise. When it comes to the story, Bond films are and have always been about the mission, with its scale, importance, and uniqueness highlighted as the theme of the film. We've seen this since the 60s. It works. It what makes Bond movies Bond movies. But for some reason this new team that worked and Skyfall and now Spectre and trying to humanize James Bond, they're trying to create a deeper story that frankly no true Bond fan is asking for. We don't want to know about Bond's past, or his estranged brother or his dead parents. James is mean't to be a spy, a rogue who sips martinis and loves a different woman every night. Not a broken man with a haunted past. Save that for other films. This new trend is going to ruin what makes Bond timeless: consistency. The only reason new actors could seamlessly fill in the role of Bond is because Bond has no exposition, no backstory. You could say that he's just a name with certain mannerisms and behaviors. That's it. What will happen to the next Bond when Craig retires the role? It will be so awkward to fill in his shoes now, because he's no longer filling in an archetype, but a fully fledged character. The inconsistencies will rise, compromises will be made and story telling will be more awkward than ever. \n       Now the counter argument is that this new focus on James and his past deepens the story, it garners emotion. You don't need to expose Bond's past to create emotional moments. If that's what the director wants, he's doing it the wrong way. He's creating a split between the campy, sexy Bond we know and love and this new conflicted, haunted, brooding Bond we have now. Both are acceptable, but when there's and imbalance, you have an identity crisis in the film, and that's what Specte suffers from. \n   So how do you invoke emotion without revealing Bond's past? Easy, it's been there along. Focus on his relationship with women. It's his hubris. That's what I appreciated about Spectre's story, it exploited Bond's weakness towards the women he loves, and how he can never keep them safe. That works. That's Bond. \n    So stick with what makes Bond so special, and if you want to complicate him, do so by focusing on what we already know of Bond instead of making something up. ", "Please bring back David Arnold for Bond 25.", "This is my least favorite Bond film since Daniel Craig got the part. \nI felt it was just full of cliches, but don't get me wrong I'm ok with 007 cliches, the thing is that in this movie everything just feels \"meh\". \nThere isn't A SINGLE scene in which we fear something really bad is gonna happen, or we think \"shit he is screwed\". Every fight scene seems like it was planned 5 minutes before shooting, and the conclusions are just too obvious to the point I could see how a fight scene would end even before it started. The writers didn't provide any satisfactory surprises.\nThe plot feels like it was the millionth time an agent must make everything himself because the agency is screwed. Skyfall did it. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol AND Rogue Nation did it. Even Kingsman did it. I'm done with this story repeating over and over in every spy movie. It was the perfect time for the oldschool classic \"mission\" movie!\nI got to the conclusion this film lacks A LOT of depth. Everything stays at the surface of ALMOST being great: action sequences,the plot, comic reliefs...\nThe chase scenes were boring as hell.... Nothing we never saw a thousand times in other movies and TV shows...\nAnd finally,  it was too forced! It feels like they were trying to connect the other movies and couldn't find how to do it, so they just said everything was connect... and that's it. No explanation, nothing, just a \"Did you know everything was connected since the first one? Yes it was... The other villains were all friends... Cool hahn?\" ", "I was disappointed by how much goofier Q's character was in this after Skyfall.

First it was the abandoned island in Skyfall,  now Blofeld's base is blown up in like five seconds after Bond shoots like 5 guys.  A huge action scene could have happened there. I really didn't see the budget on screen for this outing outside of the opening scene. \n\nI didn't like Blofeld's back story and relation to Bond. Him being involved with everything in the past movies felt like a cringey retcon. \n\nBoth Skyfall and Spectre have underwhelming third acts and turn to shit after Bond escapes the villains lair. \n\nI loved the Austria stuff,  the opening scene,  and the train fight.  Everything else was OK to meh. Why didn't they bring back Hinx for a second fight with Bond at the end?  Felt like a badass henchman was wasted. \n\nI really can't believe that they didn't fix any of the problems that were were acknowledged in the Sony leaks. It's the same movie basically.

The first drill was supposed to negatively impact his balance, aim, and reflexes? It sort of reminds me of Skyfall after Bond had done his tests and we found out he wasn't 100%. \n\nThe second drill though...that was interesting. Are they setting up something in a future movie? They said he wouldn't be able to remember faces. Then Tracy, er, Dr. Swann told him she loved him.  In the same scene Blofeld mentions he's taken his mother's name, perhaps somehow there is something maternal in Swann's actions? I dunno, that is probably a reach. ", "I saw it a few days ago. (Japan airs movies really late)\n\nPersonally, I thought it was a okay if not boring film. I think most of my opinion will be the same as what others have said.\n\nIf your argument with me is that it's paying homage to the previous Bond films...that's great...but that's also the problem. It's 2015...and some of those things just don't work. \n\nThe action scenes were boring because you just don't feel like there's any danger. How am I supposed to feel excited when I know that James Bond is going to survive and nobody around him seems to be bothered? Ex: the Helicopter scene in Mexico. How is NOBODY freaking out that the helicopter is spinning around and might crash? How is there no police telling people to evacuate or people whipping out their smartphones to record it? It's not realistic and it's not entertaining for an action film.\n\nSecond -and this is probably just my pet peeve- but am so sick and tired of the guy getting the girl in action movies in general..so when this happened in Spectre I just rolled my eyes. Bond having sex with Monica Bellucci's character was not necessary and weird given her husband just passed away. Yes...I get that in Bond movies for some reason Bond has to have sex with every other woman but really? It was just off-putting.\n\nI like Dr. Swann's character, at least in the beginning. She was interesting and she could to an extent hold out on her own. I probably wouldn't have minded if they got together at the end...but their relationship was rushed if not forced. All of a sudden she's in love with him? Why? Because they had this exciting train fight? Because Bond is just...amazing? I could see them as a duo at best...and that's about it.\n\nWhich relates to my final issue..when in the middle of Bond stopping C from launching the Nine-Eyes project she decides to bail because \"she just can't do it anymore\". Feel free to argue with me on this, but this just felt like the stupidest move which led to her being the damsel in distress later on. If she had just stayed with Bond the entire time that scene wouldn't have had to happen...not that it mattered because in reality there wasn't much consequence either way. Nobody else was in that building and clearly the explosion didn't seem to cause any racket to the city. \n\nSo yeah...it..was..okay...at best. Would not want to see it again...and if this is just to set up ANOTHER Bond movie..then that's just sad because it can't even stand on it's own.

Which, ironically, reinforces C's ENTIRE point at the beginning. If Bond just found the coordinates of the lair and MI6 dropped a drone strike on the crater they could have saved 50 minutes of screen time, 2 train tickets and 2 holes in Bonds head. Yayyyyy field operatives...?\n\n-Spectre knew enough about bond and MI6 to know pretty much his entire history but still let him keep his watch on. Then the Super Brain-Sucker 5000 conveniently works by bringing his hands together... Behind his back...? But maybe that's knit-picking.\n\n- The force-fed background story behind Bonds upbringing and its involvement with Blowfish (w/e) was completely ridiculous and took me out of it.\n\n\nAll and all it wasn't a bad bond film! Action was good, women were hot etc. But, like others have said, Skyfall has spoiled us with expectations for thicker plots and more coherent narratives. I thought Craig did an excellent job, he was just doing the best with what he was given. Whole cast as great as ever. Hopefully they're given a little more to work with the next time around.

Was there any explanation as to why the entire building exploded during the brief gun fight? Are we supposed to assume these terrorists brought the bomb they were planning on using for the stadium to their meeting in the hotel? Seems dumb to me.\n\nIf the Pale King wanted Bond to finish what he had started and track down Oberhauser, why doesn't he just tell Bond about the hotel room? Once he is dead there would be absolutely no reason for the villains to go after his daughter. In fact the only way his daughter can be put in danger is by forcing Bond to go find her and lead the villains to her. \n\nThe car chase was terrible. Nothing interesting happened. They tried to play up the camp with Bond pushing the old man's car from behind, but all the humor is lost because Bond is ignoring everything that's happening to talk to Moneypenney.\n\nWhy have a research lab in the most remote impossible to reach snowy location imaginable? So Bond can have a snow scene, duh. How did that ring have 5 different people's DNA still on it somehow?\n\nTwo of the worst Bond girls ever. Neither had any chemistry with Bond. Monica Bellucci could have been cut from the film her scene is so inconsequential. Seydoux is a stiff damsel in distress, even though she's supposed to be some highly intelligent Dr. You never get the sense that Bond and Swann are equals like you did with Eva Green's character in Casino Royal. The idea that Bond would give up everything to be with this run of the mill boring chick he just met is absurd. \n\nThe torture scene....just terrible. Everyone else has already covered this one. What I was wondering, much like the mountain top research facility, was why is Waltz's lair in the middle of a dessert? How do all of those employees get to the facility? Do they all live there? Didn't appear like it. Do they commute via a four day train ride and another long distance car ride? If you run an international terror group that has control over the surveillance of every major country, you don't need your base to be in the middle of nowhere. If i walk down my basement I lose my wifi connection, how the hell are they getting an internet connection good enough to control all of the world's surveillance in the middle of a dessert??\n\nChristoph Waltz was completely wasted. It took forever for him to be introduced, then once he is you barely see him do anything. The character seems cool, but there just wasn't enough of him.\n\nJust not an enjoyable movie overall. I really just want to see Daniel Craig in a Bond film where he just tries to thwart a terrorist attack. I don't need everything to be some grand conspiracy that stretches back into Bond's past and threatens the future of MI6. Just give me a good action movie with some interesting characters and set pieces. As sad as it is to say, i'm actually looking forward to a Bond film not directed by Sam Mendes.", "I just watched the film because I was afraid that it was going to be replaced tomorrow, and I don't understand why a lot of critics are aghast over the film. I don't think the film creaking with the weight of what it aimed to do over two-and-a-half hours deserves a castigation. To me, it was a very enjoyable ride. \n\nA friend and I talked about Dr. Swann's character being among the more empowered and intelligent women in the series, and Lea Seydoux killed the role and showed why both of them were meant to be with one another. The 'dirty martini' quip from Swann was awesome. \n\nI was happy to see a 50-year old Monica Bellucci still have it and enjoy Bond, too. I have no problems with her short air-time: she was there for the purpose of information, and she offered it.

I guess a lot of people cry foul with Blofeld being such a weak character, but times have changed. \n\nIt's a solid 8.5/10 for me. I really enjoyed the happy ending that Bond deserved, and I also enjoyed the woman that she ended up with. When James told her to look into his eyes while the video of her father killing herself was played, and she trusted him, I knew she was a special lady for James. Vesper didn't trust him enough to let him save her, but Madeline did. \n\nGreat closure to Craig's time as Bond. I won't be surprised if he won't do any more. I also laughed throughout the film.

You don't just pop out references to other films without at least giving a reason for it. If Skyfall is connected, give us a low down. If Casino Royal and QoS are your doing, just say it. Seriously, it's a stretch to get the actors to come back, we get it, but try dammit.\n\n2. That theme song. Just nooo, nooooooo.\n\n3. If Seydoux and Craig had just teamed up as spies, ditching the whole \"we've both lost something.\" angle and done something, perfect. I *LIKED* the Olga Kurylenko character from Quantum. I liked that she teamed with Craig and whooped some ass. Nothing wrong with that.\n\n4. Monica Bellucci probably was just there for a bait and switch. Seriously, she was there to just tell Craig \"Yo, you killed my husband probably but hey, screw it, let's go. Also, you're probably dead but eyy, whatever.\" You could've shot her in the BED and it would've worked better to show James just how up against the wall he was.\n\n5. I'll address Waltz quickly. He tried guys, he really tried to bring something to this but you could see the \"I WILL BE BACK.\" sign all over him and the studio was like \"Don't over do it like Silva.\"\n\nThe Aww Yisses\n\n1. The jokes. Wow I laughed out loud a few times. The movie had a sense of humor, I'll be damned. They knew almost, that this was probably the end of a lot of things. At least they weren't stuffy about it.\n\n2. The subtly on some of things they did in the film. There was word play that really kind of sold a lot of these characters as having been friends and colleagues for a while. Nice.\n\n3. The car chases might've dragged on a bit but hey, they were still incredibly tense.\n\n4. Bautista is the god damn Terminator of bond henchman. I thought he was Jaws for most of it until I just realized, he could probably *TAKE* Jaws.\n\n5. Craig pretty much bought, paid and sold the movie himself. You can tell he wanted to give it his best and leave his way in this whole thing. The torture scene was kind of gruesome (I cringed) and the way he manically pursued these people invoked more of that Casino Royale feel.\n\nThe Stew\n\nThe movie has some odd blends. It's almost two movies with the same plot and different executions. With MI6 getting swallowed by MI5 and the CNS, you could practically make a whole movie on having Q, Moneypenny and M sorting through the mud to find the connection to Spectre and bringing down the CNS while still trying to connect Spectre.\n\nSame goes with Craig, who basically just went rogue (again) to find and end another secret organization that was hell bent of controlling the world at large.\n\nThis one will be incredibly debated film wise. It'll take time for the hype to melt and the sentiments to really come down to the finalization of it. Probably need a few viewings to really appreciate it.", "I found them over very disjointed. Action set pieces strung together by minimal plot or explanation as to why they're going to the next location. There was zero development of the supposed relationship between Bond and Blofeld.

Given its ~65% on RT I expected to at least like something about it.\n\nBut I didn't. I disliked just about everything about it. Worst of all, I was completely bored throughout. My major points:\n\n1. There was no energy in the movie. Craig and company seemed not to care about anything. His face barely moved the entire time (not that it ever did much in earlier movies but at least in CR/Skyfall there was something). Until they get to Morocco the colour palette is very monochrome, very black (or grey) and white. And it returns to that scheme after Morocco. It just sucks the life out of everything.\n\n2. Building on the lack of energy is the scarcity of interesting action. We have the very low-energy and underwhelming intro sequence (weak helicopter fight - contrast this with the parkour across the construction site in CR), the Rome car chase, the Austria car chase, the train fight, the very short shootout in Morocco and the exploding MI6 building/Thames helicopter chase. None of which I would describe as particularly interesting. That's it. In a ~2h30m movie. It's just so, so, so goddamn slow and long and does not have enough energy to buoy it back up. \n\n3. Everything seemed to fall flat. The old-Bond humour they attempted to stick in a few times failed (for me) as a result of the low energy of the film. The Sam Smith into song was just lol (especially the high-pitched sections), considering that Bond movies have tended to have 'strong' songs. This one just felt depressing and needlessly terrible. The Jackie Chan style couch escape from the collapsing building, etc. Nothing just seemed to click for me. It just felt like people talking for two hours about nothing I really cared about.\n\nApart from those three main issues are the enormous amount of in-scene inconsistencies and hilarious moments that can only be explained as 'for plot', and which made me roll my eyes. The most egregious examples:\n\n1. Why does the new headquarters of the ENTIRE UK INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS apparently have no security or overnight staff whatsoever? Especially on the date where at midnight the new super-Orwellian surveillance system will go live? So that when the Director comes into his office at ~11:30pm it looks like he's an office drone darting back into his cubicle for a file he forgot? Where's the duty room full of overnight analysts ready to pop the cork at midnight? Where's the staff that might be present to prevent terrorists from coming to bomb everything?\n\n2. They go on about the 'Nine Eyes' community. In real life, there are the 'Five Eyes', the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The first meeting takes place in Tokyo, so Japan must be one of the new four. We also see China and South Africa. So we are supposed to believe that China is willing to tie its entire intelligence apparatus to Japan, Britain and, worst of all, America? Or vice-versa? OK. Clearly SPECTRE doesn't directly control all of these national organs (as they do in the UK) since they had to force South African co-operation through a terrorist attack in Cape Town. \n\n3. Craig's Bond has been established as a more-brutal individual over the last movies. Why didn't he shoot the primary henchman after he went through the window in Austria? For that matter, why was the primary henchman so goddamn boring? He Mountain's the first dude's eyes out and then says one word before he dies (I guess? We don't see him decapitated by the rope and never see him later on despite the fact that after being pulled outside of the train he wouldn't be being strangled and he's implied to be, and clearly is, a huge tough fucker) Compare him to Oddjob, Jaws, May Day, Xenia, etc. \n\n4. In Morocco White's daughter gets drunk and falls asleep on the bed in her dress. Then when Bond finds the secret room she's in a slip. So she woke up and stripped off her dress while this guy she still doesn't really know or like at this point is sitting a few feet away and then fell asleep again? And then what about the secret room full of guns and passports is in this random Moroccan hotel that White visited once a year? What happens when a pipe bursts on the floor above and the hotel owner has to call in repairs? When the Moroccan workmen trying to repair the flood damage break through into a room full of guns and passports?\n\n5. Why does Bond basically rape Schirra's widow after the funeral? Consider the following narrative: 'I just killed your husband and some assassins and you say more assassins will be coming and you're terrified for your life but as I'm interrogating you I kiss you all over and push you against the wall and then we have sex and you tell me what I want to know?' Does that make sense outside of crazy land? Oh, and despite SPECTRE being said by everyone to have effectively infinite reach Felix can protect you in America? Sure.\n\n6. Why is the train scene so stupid? Bland henchman comes with no support at all  for some reason to fight bond. Because he has no support White's daughter is able to come to Bond's aid rather than being restrained by said support. The train is maybe 10 cars long and they fight through 4 (dining, bar, kitchen, storage), and there is no issue? The train doesn't stop for police somewhere to investigate the huge fight? Oh and after the fight Bond and the daughter are 'Are you thinking that too?' and just go off to bone? No-one with authority on the train wants to talk to them about what just went down?\n\n7. When he's in the iChair in Morocco with Blofeld. Why does the chair throw all its restraints wide open when the bomb goes off? Is that a new app or something? Blofeld clearly says that the first drill incision will mess with Bond's balance and coordination, but he is able to run and shoot all the henchmen with no issue shortly after and about a day later can shoot a fucking helicopter engine with a pistol from a moving speedboat on the Thames. Blofeld says the second incision will make him forget faces, and the incision goes through. But this doesn't happen. Is the chair broken or does Bond just have two of whatever centers he was cutting into?\n\n8. When did this life-changing love between Bond and the daughter develop? Over the few days the movie took from their first meeting to the ending? We don't see any of this and are then expected to care enough to believe that their relationship is a core part of this Bond 'giving up' on the lifestyle. And then when they get to the 'big' confrontation in London she just walks off on her own down the dark street? Not a chance she's going to get snatched, no sir. \n\n9. Why does the 'Three Million Pound Prototype' DB10 have a 1960's toggle switch control panel and display cut into and sticking out of its dashboard for its gadgets with label-printer labels for identification? Previous Bond cars have had everything tied into the on-board display system or whatever. For that matter, why are the labels not identifying exactly what the systems do? 'Exhaust' instead of 'Rear Flamethrowers'? 'Air' instead of 'Ejector Seat'? Why is 'Atmospheric' for music in the middle of these offensive weapons systems? \n\nSorry for the rant. It just really got to me I guess. Time to go purge this with some Goldfinger/OHMSS/Goldeneye/CR etc!", "I don't think Waltz was the right choice for this movie. He seemed to happy and I never felt the intimidation or the evil that the character should have had. That being said, I did think this Bond felt the most like a classic Bond film and I'm glad to see it move further away from being the Bourne knockoff it was before Skyfall. It also kept up the emotional Bond trend where he constantly battles inner turmoil and secretly wants to settle down with a wife. With all this considered I still enjoyed it. I didn't think it was a great Bond film but it was entertaining.\n\n\nOf course, my issue with this film is the same as it has always been with Craig's Bond, it takes itself too seriously. It's like it wants to be a Bourne movie but keep the Bond name while constantly turning its nose up at its predecessors. The movies makes little inside jokes about the gadgets of the old films, like Q making fun of the pen in Skyfall or his watch joke in Spectre, but that is what made him cool! That's something Craig's Bond will never get. Bond started the trend of awesome gadgets like laser watches and exploding pens and it's what made him so awesome. He's not supposed to struggle with a single unnamed bad guy in a bathroom; he's supposed to take out an entire enemy base by himself with a wristwatch and a pistol (which he did in this film and that was awesome).\n\n\nFinally, Craig's Bond is way too emotional. I get that Die Another Day was way too over the top and they needed to ground the character, but Casino Royal did that and they didn't need to continue it in every movie. How many times is Bond going to fall in love and quit the spy game? If I wanted to see a spy with inner turmoil who constantly falls in love I expect him to be Matt Damon. Often Craig doesn't even have cool one liners and even got stumped by Moriarty during their first conversation in this movie. If I had to rank them I'd say Man From U.N.C.L.E. Was the best Bond movie I've seen in the last couple years. Henry Cavill should have been Bond since he has all the swagger and Bondishness that Craig lacks.", "Why has Mendes written himself and Bond into a difficult and ultimately, costly hole? \n\nThis should have been the film, that like A New Hope creates an adversary that Bond couldn't defeat in the first film - and the ending just sinks it. Simply cut it at the Helicopter flying away with Bond on the boat and done! \n\nSo obvious that the next Bond is going to have a sequence showing Blofeld escaping and Swann getting offed in some brutal off-screen action. \n\nUgh.\n\n\nAs for the surveillence theme - wouldn't it be more appropriate using the financial crash as a build up for a more faithful version of Blofeld? Not to mention the subplot for M & Co. - opposing cuts to the budget, much like real life, as opposed to surveillence? \n\nLikewise, C simply felt like Moriarty in a new role, easy enough fodder for M to fight off. \n\nTerrible title song and the opening descended into farce when the assassination failed. \n\nWaltz was brilliant, given his poor script and the less said about the 'base' in Africa the better. A little more time spent inside the ruins of Thames House would have been much a better confrontation, than that of Africa Base. \n\nSo disappointing, I'd struggle to give it more than a 6/10.", "I...I can't justify any reason to think this movie was pleasant other than visually. Did they just decide that characters don't need motivation anymore? Seriously, L\u00e9a's character was THE worst movie character I've ever seen. She made more 180 degree emotional changes than a bipolar, angsty teenager. ", "Pretty sure I'm the only person in the world that loved this movie. Yes, it wasn't as dark or grim as Skyfall, but that doesn't mean it was worse (Skyfall was better, but dark doesn't mean good). If this movie was released 15 years ago, IMO it would be considered one of the best Bonds ever. The tone is different to the other Craig bonds, going back to it's roots, but it goes back to the old style extremely well.\n\nYes, there were a few problems with the script, but nothing too major, especially for a movie like this. The strength definitely lied in the acting and directing, especially in the set-pieces, which were excellent. The opening sequence alone made the movie worth the price of admission for me.", "I think this being his last Bond film, Sam Mendes went all out and gleefully crammed it full of classic Bond tropes. \n\ne.g.\n\n* \"Bond, James Bond.\"\n* \"Shaken, not stirred.\"\n* White dinner jacket\n* Bond strapped to the seat with the brain drills (I half expected a laser to come down from the ceiling)\n* Use of ejector seat in the Aston\n\netc. \n\nYou know what? I'm not ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it. The camp and throwback elements of the film put smiles on my face. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "What a waste of Christoph Waltz.\n\nHe had such an awesome introductory scene in Rome. Here's a guy that when he enters the meeting, a room full of powerful, evil elites shut their mouths and stand at attention for him. The way the shadow hid his face was great and I love the way he delivers the line \"Welcome James\". He's built up as a menacing and powerful villain and then for the rest of the movie, I didn't feel the same kind of intimidation from him as I did from that scene.", "What a waste of potential that was. With that director, cast, and budget I was expecting to be blown away, but it really just fell flat. They shoehorned in too much campy comic relief, even in the most serious scenes, the plot was essentially just globe hopping to the next informant again and again with a few contrived plot twists, and the action was difficult to believe or get invested in. The whole character of C was just a big cliche (maybe that's what it stands for), every scene where M went on about democracy or election like some kind of middle school idealist and C responded like an edgier middle school  idealist just made me want to pull a Mr White. I wish they hadn't pulled the other movies into this mess.\n\nWorst of Craig's Bonds easily. I went in expecting and wanting to love it. I could go on and on, but that movie was exhausting.", "I really wanted to like this movie but I find it hard to. A few issues I find glaring and didn't make sense at all (SPOILERS):\n\n- Falling debris from a building is completely harmless and you will likely end up falling directly onto a couch, but glass shattering will hurt your forehead and will cause another person to fall off the ledge and die.\n- During the snow chase scene, multiple cars are seen randomly exploding after they crash.\n- Dave Bautista's \"oh shit\", it seemed so out of place after the intense fight scene.\n- There's so much back and forth going on in Seydoux's character that I have no idea what she is standing for. She changes from \"I don't want to fall into your arms\" to having sex on train in a snap of a finger. Then, she reverts back to \"I don't want to change you\". At the end of the movie, she's with Craig again. \n- Waltz's team of guards are so poorly trained.\n- Waltz's torture machine failed. Twice. Is that a prototype unit?\n- A localised fire can trigger a massive explosion everywhere. Is Waltz storing data or crude oil?\n- Craig finds Seydoux by chance in the finale sequence just by staring at Waltz who is inside a helicopter. \n- The netting also by chance not break after they plunged from so many stories above, and only breaks by chance after they've landed on it so that they can escape in time and catch the boat.\n", "It should have ended at the destruction of Blofeld's base in the desert. I knew he would escape so I can see him in the next instalment. But NO, he had to come back to London to kill Bond again. How does a well known terrorist get into London in this day and age? Not able to kill Bond, obviously, I was expecting him to escape in the helicopter. But NO, he had to be caught by M. That\u2019s my only gripe.", "I have mixed emotions about the movie. Overall I did enjoy it, but there are many parts which seemed a little over-the-top and campy. Way more humour this time around (at least I thought so).\n\nBautista was amazing, but was unfortunately relegated to a disposable henchman role. He could have been used a lot more.\n\nWaltz of course was born to play a villain and delivers in that regard, although he was also underused. The scene in Rome where he enters the room is breathtaking...you could hear a pin drop in the theatre.\n\nYou can tell that Daniel Craig is tired of playing Bond, but I think he did a good job all the same.\n\nI'll have to write a full review another day as it's late here but I'd rate it a 7/10.", "A very minor point but I was underwhelmed with the theme song. Both *Casino Royale* and *Skyfall* had these amazing theme songs. (*Quantum of Solace* was ok.) I don't know why I expect more from Bond movies but I really look to the opening action sequence and the theme song to get me ready for the movie. *Spectre*'s song and opening sequence were both just \"meh\" for me. I saw it on opening night; I could have waited until it was on HBO or Netflix.", "Anyone else feel like the sound editing/score wasn't very good, especially in the beginning? I thought the CGI was poor too. ", "I was really disappointed in this one... Thought it was boring, and the whole thing had be wondering why is any of this happening..\n\nPlus like.. Why the fuck didn't blofield just kill bond - the whole ending was good awful cliche of typical villain tropes.", "I feel like they had so much potential in this film. I mean they had all the right ingredients but not the perfect recipe. I was excited in the opening scene and waited for the film to pick up from that, but that never quite happened and I left disappointed. And I did not even quite get the chemistry between Bond and Madeleine. I understood the relationship between Bond and Vesper and him wanting to leave everything for her, but this...\nAlso, I felt like they did not do justice to some of key points of the film and wasted too much time on other things (like the car chase). \nJust my opinion. It wasn't the worst, just needed that extra something. 5.5/10", "i can't stop thinking about Skynet or Hydra when it comes to third act of this movie", "I'm happy that the general consensus here seems to be that Casino Royale is the best, Skyfall comes next, and this one is down close to Quantum of Solace. Casino Royale was stunning, and the other three have ranged from quite good to just not fun.", "Interesting thing I noticed: when Oberhauser told Swann he visited her father at his home, it made me think of Inglorious Basterds, where the same happened (Waltz visiting Lea Seydoux' father)", "So did anyone else feel like the last 30 mins was trying to be a Batman movie? The joker-esque graffiti on the walls, Waltz's crazy laugh when asked if he was bluffing, the whole I have the \"love of your life\" tied up and surrounded by explosives thing...", "I didn't really like the first 2/3rds of the movie.  The opening, long scene was great but it almost felt like the first part of the movie had so much action that it took away from the story.  It was just moving so slow.  I also like Christoph Waltz a lot but he didn't really have much to work with.  Raoul Silva was a much better villain.  Overall I enjoyed it, but it's not on the level of Skyfall or Casino Royale.  It's about the same as Quantum of Solace which I enjoyed. ", "It wasn't bad, it was just kinda average for a Bond movie. Daniel Craig seemed a little tired and not interested. Oberhauser was a pretty meh villain. Also the length of the movie was too damn long. It should have ended when they were at that Crater facility.\n\nThough it has flaws, I enjoyed the movie and the \"classicness\" of it.", "Just got out of the movie. My thoughts: \n\n* Maybe the worst Bond song ever from Sam Smith.\n\n* Can you even call Christoph Waltz a supporting character? It was more of a cameo. In the beginning he's like this ominious badass then disappears for the next hour and a half (basically the whole middle of the movie) then reappears in the end as kind of a pussy.\n\n* Quantum of Solace had the writer's strike, what's Spectre's excuse? I legit think I'd rather watch QoS again than Spectre. Way to end Daniel Craig's Bond on a down note.", "Watching the amazing train fight scene and realising Batista would make an unreal Bane. ", "I just dont really get the story in these past few Bonds. They're incredibly convoluted to me. I have no idea who he's going after half the time. I hear if you watch them back-to-back they make a lot more sense, but... eh. ", "The opening Mexico City Sequence was probably up there with my favorite cinematic+action sequences ever. However the rest of the movie was 6/10 at most for me. ", "Daniel Craig as James Bond\n\nChristoph Watlz as Franz Oberhauser\n\nL\u00e9a Seydoux as Dr. Madeleine Swann\n\nAnd\n\nMonica Bellucci as Lady who was in the film.", "I really disliked it.  It felt hollow and flat compared to what we first experienced in Casino Royale.  The opening scene and the long tracking shot was great but when he falls through the building and lands on the couch I knew we were heading in a bad direction.  The Sam Smith song was boring.  Christopher Waltz turned out to be a pretty lame villain and played into the whole trope of \"explaining my evil plan\" since the writers weren't good enough to show Spectre's motivations.  Really disapointed they brought back the cheese instead of the one line zingers.  And that plane scene was so stupid, it reminded me of Pierce Brosnan surfing on a wave in Antarctica.

Really enjoyed it. Some thoughts.\n\n Loved how sudden and not-telegraphed all of the encounters with the troglodytes were. Like, the heroes round a corner and get shot in the arm by an arrow. There was no loud fanfare to these climactic face-offs. Something about how close and quick they were really unnerved me. Because you realize they can happen at any time, without the usual horror movie tropes of a musical crescendo or whatever.\n\nThat death scene. Fuck.\n\n\"Say goodbye to your wife. I'll say hello to yours.\" One of my favorite movie lines in some time.\n\nMatthew Fox was excellent. I don't always like him, and I think only certain roles really suit him. This was one of them.\n\nMain thing I wasn't fond of was how it basically becomes a typical action-rescue flick in the latter half if the third act. I get that it's showing O'Dwyer's determination to rescue his wife, but it was a bit.preposterous that he made it there, then up a sheer cliff face with that broken leg.\n\nBut overall, I enjoyed it.

", "Probably one of the most horrific death scenes I have ever seen was in this movie. Great movie though! Very well done!", "Such a great film! Kurt Russell is great as always, but Richard Jenkins really shines here! And like everyone is saying, the death scene in this movie is incredibly disturbing. I'm no stranger to violence in film,but I found the scene in question to be very uncomfortable and upsetting.  I'd put it up there with the Irreversibe fire extinguisher scene. Excellent movie overall.", "I think this is a really smartly written film that may get a lot of attention for its level of violence. There are so many great details and moments that took me by surprise. \n\nLike the speech Chicory gives about the flea circus and Samantha's comforting lie about the flea's being alive and the circus being real. I thought that both a wonderful character moment and a smart way to comfort someone in a hopeless situation. \n\nOther things I liked:\n\n* O'Dwyer is basically impotent throughout most of the movie due to his leg. It makes for an interesting subversion of the typical heroic cowboy cliche. He's forced to rely on the help of others and change up his tactics because of his injury, and in the end its what gives them the edge.\n\n* Matthew Fox plays unhinged so well. I liked that they didn't take his character towards an all out villain or additional antagonist for them to deal with. He has experiences which inform his character and thinking. You would understand why someone like him would shoot first when someone approaches his camp at night in uncharted territory. He causes some friction but he never strays from the mission at hand.\n\n* I loved Chicory's character. His naivete was a little annoying at first but it grew on me over time. His back and forth with Kurt Russell about reading in the bathtub was this great moment of lightness where I decided he absolutely **had** to survive. Glad he did.\n\n* Kurt Russell needs to continue finding roles that allow him to keep that mustache. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "I loved the sheer idea of it, a rescue mission to a monstrous unknown.

Most importantly, it wasn't nearly deep enough to warrant a 2:12 playtime. The second act dragged on way too long. It had a great cast but the characters were all pretty stereotypical western tropes. Through the entire second act I just kept thinking \"this was a lot better with Russel Crow and Christian Bale in the 3:10 to Yuma remake\".\n\nI think a lot of my disappointment steamed from the fact that I didn't know much about the movie going in, so for the first 2 acts I was really enjoying a nice western law movie. Then in the third act it was pretty obvious that it was just going to be The Hills Have Eyes in the Wild West and I lost all interest. I love horror movies, but there was nothing interesting or compelling about the enemies in this movie. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if the indian guy from the beginning had a bigger role - perhaps he could have added  some insight to humanize these villains instead of just making them animals.\n\nOverall I just didn't enjoy the movie much. I really wanted to because I love Kurt Russel, Patrick Wilson and the rest of the cast. One thing is for sure - I considered watching it with my western-loving dad...

I think it's just a strange film which doesn't really work, and amounts to far less than you'd expect with the directing and acting talent involved.\n\nDaniel Craig is fine, he's clearly bored out of his mind with the role now. The Day of the Dead sequence looked absolutely stunning but it wasn't at all engaging. Most of the film had a similar feeling, like I was watching a beautifully shot commercial for a product I didn't want to buy (perhaps ironic as there is much less product placement in this than the other Craig films). It leapt around from set piece to set piece without ever really getting interesting, and without the sense that the main characters were ever in any kind of danger.\n\nThe debate on privacy and surveillance between M and C was painful. Just awful, clunky dialogue that really talked down to the audience and stood out bizarrely. C is of course probably most famous for playing Moriarty, and pretty much just did exactly the same character in this. He may as well have walked into the room with \"baddie\" stamped on his forehead 10 minutes in.\n\nI thought Lea Seydoux was very good. I have absolutely no idea why they bothered having Monica Bellucci for all of 5 minutes, I assume most of her scene(s) ended on the cutting room floor. Christophe Waltz was ok; as he was so blatantly Blofeld I suppose I expected some kind of unsettling madman, only to instead see a pretty reserved performance, memorable only for him torturing bond whilst wearing slip on shoes and no socks, like he was on a cruise. I didn't find him any more threatening or fiendish than Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nA bit disappointing, probably enough crowd pleasing moments to make it worth watching, but I think it was a step back towards the campy and dated Bond I'd grown to loathe.\n", "DISCLAIMER: I did not think this film was as bad, it just has a lot of bad moments (that I will vent about here). Also SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS.\n\nI was so frustrated by this film. The opening scene is maybe one of the best Bond scenes I have seen and the first half an hour is generally promising, but then it goes into one of the most drawn out, un-engaging car chases in any film (why are there only two cars driving on the streets of Rome aside from the chase?) I have seen. Then the real plot(?) starts to make a little more sense, its some kind of NSA type surveillance government thing that will get rid of the double-0 program, but its also all a personal thing for 007. Then the film becomes a series of cheesy awkward scenes, an amazing amount of cliches and a really boring middle section on a train. There are some nice moments of action and funny Bond throwbacks, but I'll mainly focus on the bad things instead:\n\n- \"the dead are alive\" seemed a bit out of place, I'm not sure why it was necessary \n\n- why the fuck does he decide to chase the cars on the mountain in a fucking plane? what did he think was going to happen? what was his endgame? the plane has no weapons and he wouldn't have been able to jump out to get them because he was flying it. He definitely didn't plan what eventually happened, because nobody could of, the whole thing just makes zero sense.\n\n- why do I feel like I've seen the guy-starting-to-teach-a-girl-how-to-use-a-gun-then-the-girl-takes-the-gun-and-unloads-it-and-puts-it-down-in-front-of-him scene a million times?\n\n- Mr Hinx was cool but so underused, also his last line/word sounded really weird and dubbed\n\n- Why does he start beating up the pilot of the helicopter that he is in?!?!? He's just flying it beat him up after you finish with the first guy!!\n\n- Ahh its Blofeld what a surprise!! Ahhh!!\n\n- C's motivations were crystal clear from the first moment you see him\n\n- A lot of people (me included) complain that Skyfall turned into Home Alone at the end but did anyone feel this film turned into Scooby-Doo at the end with the M, Tanner, Moneypenny and Q team running around London solving mysteries.\n\n- 'I love you.' fuck off.\n\n- Monica Belluci is pretty much just a cameo\n\n- Noooo chemistry between Lea Seydoux and Daniel Craig, which is sad because they're both such great actors :(\n\n- Blofeld's motivations? Sibling rivalry? Daddy issues?\n\n- Also what did Spectre even want to establish? Money? Power? Both?\n\n- that weird CGI new MI6 building\n\n- fuck you Q and your shitty Hollywood hacking\n\n- \"I think we can tell what C stands for\" I wish they didn't add the line after this, and just left it as is\n\n- Who put that net in the ruined MI6 building???? What the fuck? its so convenient it's annoying.\n\n- Smart blood? they have fucking nanotechnology and that's all they use it for?\n\n- The whole film felt like it was written by a commitee, that weren't even talking to each other.\n\nI'm sure there's more to complain about but I think thats enough for now. Anyway I'm sorry for all the complaints, to be honest it wasn't terrible it had some really fun moments and had a lot of classic Bond stuff in it. \nOverall I just felt it was a bit slow, forced and unnatural, and the convoluted and formulaic plot ruined it a bit for me. I never really felt there was much tension or that Bond was in any real danger at any point, but that's just me. On the plus side, the cinematography was great.\n\n\n5.5/10 for me", "Well, I thought it was pretty bad. In many areas, it was fine. Gorgeous shots, well acted and casted, good set-pieces, nice continuity mentions, and it pretty funny and the humour was not out of place. \n\nBut my god, what a complete travesty of a plot.\n\nYou would think Christoph Waltz is made to be a Bond Villain, but he came across incredibly lame. If his aim was to kill Bond, why not, you know, kill him. Instead there was all these silly games/endeavors. The whole bit at the desert facility ended up looking rather silly. Then the wacky \"Oh no Bond you have to either save yourself or Swann in these spooky ruins\" which then leads to Bond saving her as well and himself. Followed by simply shooting down the chopper with a handgun, and thus the enigmatic \"author of all your pain\" head of the most powerful international crime syndicate is just...caught. Pathetic.\n\nHinx was great. But as others have mentioned, under-utilised. Batista did well with what he had though.\n\nSwann \"loves\" him in all of what...3 or 4 scenes? Seems so forced. Didn't really feel their chemistry. Nothing will top Vesper for Craig's Bond though, so perhaps we're spoiled.\n\nI felt like nothing in this film was really accomplished, or rather nothing changed at the end of the film, besides Blofeld losing an eye. Sure Bond found a woman and rode off happily ever after, but we've seen that plenty over the years. There wasn't really much emotional impact to the film. Never felt like there were truly any consequences to the protagonists actions. Quite literally so when Bond had 2 needles shoved in his skull that would ruin his mind and \"make him forget everyone he knew\" yet he just shrugged it off in seconds.\n\nSo, yeah, all in all...still better than QoS, but worse than Skyfall IMO, and not even in the same league as Casino Royale. If you happen to fancy watching a film from classic action series that was released in 2015, I'd recommend Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. ", "#\"HELLO PUSSY\"\n\nAlso, why'd it take so long for the discussion thread?", "Hey /r/movies , if you're interested in discussing everything about *SPECTRE* on a somewhat smaller subreddit full of avid Bond fans, we've got two discussion megathreads happening on /r/JamesBond !\n\n[**the spoiler-free SPECTRE discussion megathread**](http://www.reddit.com/r/jamesbond/comments/3qmctb/_/)\n\n[**the SPECTRE discussion megathread with spoilers**](http://www.reddit.com/r/jamesbond/comments/3qmct0/_/)\n\nHope to see some of you there! :)", "Anyone else think it's set up perfectly for a \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" Style sequel and that's why Blofeld was underused, he's perhaps getting another chance at the role?", "I really don't understand why they ended it with Bond driving off into the sunset with Madeleine.\n\nWe *already know* she won't be in the next movie and will be explained off with some throwaway comment.", "I just saw the film and I really enjoyed it, I have a soft spot for Blofeld anyway. More importantly, I have to get this off my chest, I think I saw the most brilliant reference in the Hinx train fight sequence:\n\nAt the end of that fight Hinx (the henchman) gets tied to a row of beer kegs that are chained together. One by one, they fall off the train, after which he gets pulled off the train too, to a presumable demise (or not). \n\nTo me, the shots of the kegs seemed a clear reference to the barrels scene in the film *Jaws* where they shoot several barrels at the shark to try and keep it afloat. The visual of the barrels going off the boat and the kegs going off the train is almost the same. Of course I interpreted this as a reference to the famous henchman Jaws, via the film *Jaws* and I'm sure some other people saw this too.\n\nHowever, it gets even richer. There is another famous train fight in the Bond-film *From Russia with Love* where a S.P.E.C.T.R.E-assassin tries to kill Bond on a train. This assassin is played by none other than Robert Shaw, who plays Quint in *Jaws*, so in that way it goes back around again. All of that must be intentional, because it fits so perfectly, or maybe I'm a bit drunk and rambling, who knows?", "Like Skyfall it just didn't work for me. It felt like a step backwards after the brilliance of Casino Royale. It was too cheesy, OTT, and bland. \n\nThe dialogue felt flat, especially anything to do with C. There was no chemistry between Bond and anyone really. The random romance with Mr. White's daughter felt forced as hell, it made no sense. It felt like a knockoff of an old Roger Moore all very hamfisted and cliche. I saw it last night and it's been annoying me all day how disappointed I was with it.\n\nAlso the most ridiculous thing in the whole film was at the end when Blofeld's helicopter crashes, before it's even come to a standstill the police already have police tape up. That is the fastest police response time known in the history of man. ", "That was a bit of a boring film. I cant get exactly the SPECTRE organization trying to do the whole time, that was poorly developed as well as C, just like the rest of the villains (Marvel movies, eh?) Bond girls were more disappointed. Can't understand how some one with strong characteristic and is smart ass like Madeleine act so inconsistent, there were actually nothing developed between Bond and her, they were like, \"now is the part that we love and fuck, right?\". Ewh.\n\nPlot was pretty much poor. A lot of sequences just happen and lead to nowhere. I'm sure that Blofeld would have to check his knowledge about torturing in the skull again after seeing his theory about 'this part makes your brain fucked up' actually end up nothing bad happen to Bond other than pain. Nothing more. Anyway, why would you left his girl free, why didn't you just make Bond watch you torture his girl then kill him? I don't even know what that torture sequence is for actually. And Blofeld place was hilarious, you're a king in your own place and you made a palace that can be easily chain exploded in seconds. Nice.\n\nOh by the way, Bond is now a guy with superpower, and his power is luck, no need for plan at all. I swear the 'take down the helicopter' at the end was the most fucked up moment I have in the theater, I even thought they would make Blofeld get away in this movies.\n\nAnd anyone getting bore with the story of a secret agent cause massive damage everywhere he did his mission then the government force to shut the agent program and then actually the agent is after some super secret organization?\n\n//Oh did anybody notice that the gun shot from Bond to Blofeld that hit the glass wall made a crack that had spectre's octopus shaped?", "Not good in my opinion. \n\nOpening shot was beautiful but the movie lacked in most areas for the rest of the runtime, which was probably an hour too long. I couldn't believe I was getting bored at a James Bond movie. \n\nI say bored because it wasn't engaging. It was more trying to look more beautiful and be more dramatic than Skyfall but it had nothing. Bad dialogue, almost no action at all and pointless characters (Bellucci for example). \n\nI hope the next one will try and be a smaller scale because this was way too much tryharding to top the success of Skyfall.

Also remote ass area, sure we have high speed Internet... ", "Agree with most critical things here, another thing that irked me was how they handled the callbacks to the deaths from the previous films. \n\nIt seemed like Blofeld was trying to unhinge Bond at the end, but rather than trying to do it cleverly, they just plastered the dead faces of the past in a shooting range. \"HEYYY, JUST REMINDING YOU THAT I DIED IN ANOTHER FILM, YOU'RE SAD NOW RIGHT!?!\"\n\nI feel CR, Qos and Skyfall were trying to aim at an audience aged between 20-30. This addition felt very out of place, and felt more like classic illogical Bond aimed at teenagers, which is in no way a criticism. Just a different direction they took... 4 films in I guess?\n\n5/10 was starting to wonder when the film would end (the car chase basically doubled the length of time I thought I'd been in the cinema for)\n\n\n\n", "Most of the action sequences with a vehicle require some suspension of disbelief. Can a helicopter do that many barrel rolls?  Was there enough time to get a plane to chase after the kidnappers when you can get a car?

It seemed like it would have a major part in the story at the start then it just vanishes for the rest of the film. And that Rome Car chase was so boring.

It's been a while since I've seen CR to compare. \n\nThe only issues I felt were that Blofeld lacked motivation. Okay, yeah they were step-brothers and he was jealous, but how does that lead to one becoming a super villain? \n\nThe pacing was a lot better than Skyfall, though. There weren't points were I was wishing the action to proceed. \n\nWhy did Blofeld torture Bond other than 'because I'm a Bond villain'? If he wants him dead, which he did, just kill him. Felt like plot armour for Bond. Then the affects Bond was supposed to feel - affecting his balance and his memory - didn't occur at all. What a waste. \n\nI didn't feel the relationship between Bond and Swann. I would have preferred if she remained aloof. She swooned too hard after they killed/got rid of Hinx. \n\nBelucci was wasted and it was too clich\u00e9 to sleep with her and leave. I would have liked Felix to tell Bond that he didn't get there in time. Add some guilt about causing her death, a reason to be more protective of Swann and clear his conscience. \n\nThe ending felt a bit rushed.

I was super excited to see it and was practically skipping to the theater going in, but by the end I was seriously considering just walking out of it. I think the beginning is phenomenal until the narration starts in, that's when things take a nose dive into exposition town. There is so much talking about stuff in this movie, explaining every little thing without fleshing out anything. We got introduced to fascinating characters: a blind warlock who sells hallucination bug-cakes, a mad zealot who lures children to his backyard, a young witch traveling for her first time to NY, and we have this bearded guy who throws around magic like he's it's nothing, but none of these characters ever get fleshed out. They're there to tempt us and intrigue us, but then most get offed in truly pathetic ways. All four of those actors bring a strong sense of character to the roles, but we never get enough of them to find out more. The young witch from the plane was interesting and clearly established the witch vs hunter ideas, she could've made for a awesome young apprentice. Instead we're left with Rose Leslie's weird borderline romantic interest, thank god they never kissed cause the hug was awkward enough.  \n\nThen there is the ending, I was okay with this film until that crap ending. Elijah Wood's \"twist\" was weak as hell, it's like they didn't know what else to do with him, the Witch Queen wondrously drops her strong Celtic/Scottish accent despite having been technically dead the past 800 years and decides to not try and instantly kill the guy who nearly ended her at the start, the fight scenes were short and dumb (WQ makes two guys go boom with flies in this movie, but she can only scratch Diesel's cheek?!), and they sequel baited!!! Nothing pisses me off more than when a crappy movie tries to sequel bait.\n\nThe only things I can say I liked were the few minor characters above and the magic itself.

That says something.\n\nBut talking about Fassbender.  \"He doesn't look like Jobs.\"  Wah.  Mommy.  Boo hoo.  Get over it.  The man put in an oscar-worthy performance depicting the \"orange concentrate\" of the real Jobs.", "My favorite scene in the movie is one without dialogue. At the very end of the last act, there's a shot of Jobs pacing outside his garage while Woz tinkers away at the Apple 2(?) in the corner. The imagery very much reminded me of a father waiting for his wife to give birth.\n\nTo me, it kind of explains why Jobs could never completely let go of his sentimentality towards Woz. They created a baby together. It's the same reason why he can't really ever fully abandon Waterston's character -- they created something special. ", "There were only 6 people at the 7pm Friday night showing. Wow I did not expect that low of a turnout", "Sooo, one of my favorite parts in the film is how it starts out looking real grainy when they were first launching the Mac. I was thinking \"oops bad film transfer here\" but not really. *It was meant to look like film.* Then as the movie makes it to the final 3rd act right before it's crystal hi-def digital clear. Freaking brilliant.", "I feel like at a certain point I forgot that I was watching Fassbender. It was eerie, how well he was able to embody Steve Jobs.

Mine was:\n\n>God sends his own son on a suicide mission, but we like him anyway because he made trees. ", "Loved this movie. Fassbender is the man. He's phenomenal in everything he does. The movie Shame was perhaps the most disturbing look into sexual addiction I've ever seen. Like others, I agree that I forgot that I was watching him-felt like it was Steve Jobs. \n\nQuick question: In the third act, Jobs is looking at a backlit table, with colored notecards(?) in order preparing for his speech. This looks surprisingly like an iPhone layout, aside from it only being three columns, rather than four. \n\nIs that what we're supposed to think, or is that just what I think? Would it have been too early for that illustration to be in his head, subconsciously?", "Had a blast. The entire film is pretty much straight dialogue, but Boyle's filmmaking style is so energetic, the movie was over before I knew it. There wasn't a moment where it dragged or let up. Sorkin's script was awesome and full Sorkin. It's a very fine balancing act between great humor and also well-placed dramatic moments. I loved the three-act structure, made it almost feel very theatric. The backstage setting made it feel a little like Birdman. I'm sure I'll need to watch it again to catch all of Sorkin's witticisms. However, probably the most surprising thing for me was that as much as it's a character study of Jobs, it is very much a film exploring his relationship with his daughter. \nMichael Fassbender absolutely kills it; Winslet, Rogen, and Jeff Daniels were all phenomenal too.", "I would have enjoyed the movie more if the theatre i was in had TURNED THE EXIT SIGNS OFF!!", "One of the most complex moral schemes I've ever seen in what is basically a Shakespearen epic. Jobs definitely has the tone of an asshole, but the complexity in the relationships is not simply glossed over as \"He was a nice guy here, and a terrible guy here\". Sorkin did the same sort of thing in *The Social Network*, but even better here. You can tell Sorkin was hung up on the daughter thing. I mean the dude pretty much wavered in and out during 19 years of his daughter's life. There's no getting around that. But it's not as simple, or as simply morally reprehensible as \"you're not my daughter, I deny it\". It grew to have great complexities. Jobs is a leader who sacrificed many personal relationships for his work. He was an asshole, but not *just* an asshole. I think this movie will help people see that. \n\nThe one big mistake of the film is the omission of Jobs' wife of 20 years. Sorkin basically filled in Joanna Hoffman, who worked closely with Steve, for that role. It works for the film, but leaves out a big part in Steve's life. Overall I think it's one of the best biopics you can make, giving a 2 hour glance into who Steve was, without assuming to understand the whole picture. Boyle comes through, and Sorkin shines through the script.", "I really liked it. The final scene or two were a little ham fisted, could've been a little more subtle but it was still good overall. It didn't have to be perfectly accurate, as Wozniak put it, it's a movie about expressions.", "Saw this film last month, and I wish more biopics would take liberties with style and story the way this one does, instead of sticking to generic structures and facts that I could otherwise get from just watching a bbc documentary.\n\nAlso, my favorite part about the writing, and the thing that makes me appreciate Sorkin despite knowing that no real person ever talks like his characters, is that his dialogue works on multiple levels, all at the same time, and in the same scene. One of my favorite moments was when Liane asks Jobs what his computer, after all the time he's devoted to it, can actually do, and he simply points to it and says, \"that.\" He's half pointing at Lisa, who's managed to escape her parents' argument by opening up Apple paint. Her mom is breaking down, and her Dad is yelling that he isn't her father, but the computer ensures that instead of having to face that situation, Lisa, and people in general, can have an easy escape. And what does she end up showing Jobs on the screen? A nonsensical abstract. Jobs, who loves art, is obviously enamored whereas Liane is stunned. The scene sums up everything that I think is central to making Macs what they really are - distractions that let people make random, often useless stuff that is somehow appealing, and which works for some odd reason. I'm so glad this film got made despite all the problems it faced, and absolutely overjoyed that it turned out to be as good as it is.", "That abstract painting by the little girl was beautiful, and was very, very well done. Danny Boyle + Aaron Sorkin is the new dream team. Wow, what a phenomenal movie.", "I was kinda hoping for Rogen to have one last \"Computers aren't paintings.\" He, as well as the rest of the cast, killed it.", "When Jobs and Sculley were arguing before the NeXT product launch, I thought Fassbender was going to lift his hand and cause the chairs in the room to shake. \n\nIn all seriousness, spectacular performances. ", "Jeff Daniels is such a natural fit for Aaron Sorkin. I really really really hope if we get more Sorkin-scripted films, Jeff Daniels will be there somewhere. \n\nI've read the Walter Isaacson biography  (which is a fantastic read) and this film is a perfect companion to that and a great film on its own. Let's not forget that this also feels very much like a Boyle-directed film, specifically *127 Hours* and *Slumdog Millionaire.* Boyle can seem to turn anything into a movie with the same intensity as an action film. His style has always been so dynamic, so powered on the high emotions of the scenes and the characters, it's a joy to watch and he does some of his best work here. \n\nIt's a very humanistic film, which always scores big points with me. Everything in this film was set to 12th gear and just roared. High emotions, high conflicts, high drama. Really, this is just another exhibit of the power of movies; how they can make something like a launch of an Apple products be more exciting than Vin Diesel hunting witches. \n\nSome might say that the film might be incomplete in that so little of his life is technically covered but I think we got a complete and thorough examination of who he was and a little bit of why he was the way he was. It's definitely unsentimental but it does give you understanding. \n\nIf you want the complete and factual run-down, please give the Isaacson book a read. It's excellent. But if you want to feel what it was like to be him, watch this movie. \n\n", "Movie's pacing felt like an action movie, I needed to take a piss half way through and didn't because I didn't wanna miss what's happening", "I thought it was well done. The choice to make the film take place in 3 real-time scenes was spot on, with the different styles of film being a nice touch. Script was fantastic, Fassbender was fantastic reading it. Felt like it dragged on a tad too long for me, but that might be because I saw a late-night screening.\n\nRandom other thoughts:\n\n* The part with Skylab in the hallway came out of nowhere, but I'm glad they decided to put it in like that. Really added to the scene.\n\n* The first two sections ended with \"please welcome...\", leaving the reveal of Steve Jobs to the audience until the end. Nice touch.\n\n* I want the watch Woz was wearing.\n\n* Soundtrack was... not memorable. Wish that Trent Reznor could have done it, but I guess he doesn't want to be known as \"that tech wiz biography guy\".\n\n* I think Boyle did a fine job, but I can't help but wonder what this would have looked like with Fincher at the helm. I wonder how it might have changed, thematically speaking.\n\n* Jeff Daniels has made a hell of a comeback lately. Good for him, he's great at being the upper management guy in every recent movie.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend it. I have to wonder how well it'll actually do, though; there were only 7 other people in the theater on opening night. Yikes.", "It was a really good movie. But if you're expecting it to be Social Network level of good, you might leave a little disappointed.", "It's interesting to watch the actual iMac reveal on YouTube after seeing the movie. The shark picture moment is funny to see how it really played out in the reveal. ", "Felt sort of like a modern version of A Christmas Carol. I really enjoyed it.", "Anyone else nearly cry at that last shot?\n\nHis daughter I felt was the real emotional through line of the whole movie. To see her grow up and how Jobs responded to her over time. To see him finally make a connection with her was really fulfilling to me, loved that genuine moment a lot. Seeing her in awe of her dad right before the press conference started despite his dickish behavior the whole movie. Feel that show encapsulates everything the script was trying to say about Jobs as a character.", "It took me about 5 minutes of on-screen time to realize that was Kate Winslet. What a great costume and make-up job--not to mention a solid performance from her as always.", "This movie shits on other biopics. It may not be the most accurate, but it's the most true if that makes any sense. It embodies the characters so well and each actor gives a phenomenal performance. Fassbender is currently in the lead for Best Actor in my book. For a movie that's solely dialogue it keeps you completely and totally engaged. Wonderful movie, and if Boyle didn't go ahead and Boyle up the ending it would probably be my favorite of the year, but instead it'll just have to settle into 2nd place for the time being ", "Performances were great (Woz and Jobs in the pit and Scully and Jobs before NeXT are obvious standouts), but the emotional elements felt completely shoved in. The separate sequences meant that things didn't have a buildup and payoff; like a really good movie that kept getting interrupted. \n\nSorkin's Jobs is mysterious and brilliant and and asshole - but we already knew that. And when he tries to shove the Lisa connection or the stuff with his parental history in, it doesn't make any sense because we haven't gotten to know his character at all. Each sequence is basically Jobs being who we know he is already, and then at the end they want to try to act like he made this huge growth? Like, \"just kidding it was always about you Lisa, and also i'm going to make the ipod for you!\" what?\n\nI'm a huge Sorkin fan (especially TSN and West Wing) and really liked a lot of the moments in this, but they didn't work at a whole coherent film at all for me. ", "The real star of this film - if you want to geek out - is Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld.  If you know who Hertzfeld is or have seen him on interviews, the actor not only looked like him, but really nailed is mannerisms and enthusiasm. It's the only performance worth mentioning IMHO.  Great job!", "You'd think that eventually he'd fit \"personal issues\" into his pre-launch schedule. Just a thought. But I still loved this movie a lot. You can feel Sorkin in the dialogue, everything was really well done.", "Fassbender with another home run. This man is on fire and I'm eagerly awaiting for Macbethcto come out", "I saw this movie about a week ago, and I'm delighted to see the discussion thread finally up.\n\nThrough to this point of the year, Steve Jobs is hands-down my favorite movie. It's endearing, philosophical and breathtaking. It features everyone on their A-game, be it Fassbender who, while he doesn't look the part, plays Steve with a great deal of passion, to surprise stars such as Rogen and Daniels, everyone is great.\n\nThe script is tight, as is to be expected from Sorkin. As for the direction, while I initially questioned the choice of Danny Boyle for this material (Especially after the departure of David Fincher), he proved me wrong!\n\nStructurally speaking, this movie takes the 3-act structure and makes it more of a 3-scene structure, using continuous takes in vein of Birdman to tell the story of 3 product launches. It's a unique approach to the more conventional bio-pic material that I feel elevates this movie. That, mixed with a protagonist who is as likeable and unlikeable as his interactions with others. \n\nAnother thing to note is the surprising amount of humor in the film. The audience I saw the film with genuinely laughed at the more playful moments of Sorkin's script.\n\nAll that said however, Steve Jobs is not perfect. For each product launch, they apply more of all tell, don't show mentality, which unfortunately (in my opinion) removes some of the tension the preceding events worked so hard to build. Also, the three sequences can get repetitive. Though this is intentional, it may seem as if you're watching the same narrative with variations thrice. The movie is also heavy on dialogue (A Sorkin staple) which I love, but some may not.\n\nThese minor nitpicks aside, Steve Jobs is an absolute much watch. I highly recommend it so long as you are a fan of Sorkin/Boyle's work, have an interest in Apple, or biopics appeal to you. It's a great film!\n\n", "The screenwriting was a piece of art. Sorkin managed to compress a 400+ pages biography in a perfectly smooth narrative that doesn't let you get bored for a second, while at the same time covering an insane amount of details from his life, from the 512k dispute to the  rumored stories behind Apple's name. \nThey even managed to allude to Jobs' views on portable devices, despite the 1998 setting, and criticized themselves for having all the characters cram all this info in only three events (as shown by Steve's line on people getting drunk before them).\nAnd for who's wondering, I follow Wozniak on facebook and he recently commented that he feels like this is a very accurate rendition of Steve's figure.", "I was really really disappointed in the ending, everything after talking to Lisa on the roof.

It worked much better than having constant timeline jumps like most bio dramas tend to do.", "Dialogue was great but even though the structure of the movie with the 3 launches was creative and interesting at first, it started to feel too forced. They acknowledged it in the end with Jobs mentioning everyone getting drunk line though. I think I might have preferred it with a more standard structure.", "Am I the only one who was not blown away by it? Thought it was good but not fantastic. ", "This movie was flipping candy to me. Maybe it's because I'm an Apple person, but I just loved everything from the writing (gotta love Aaron Sorkin) to the acting to the cinematography and editing and especially Fassbender's performance. The rest of the cast is excellent as well but oh jeez, Fassbender was perfect. Sorry, The Martian. There's a new best of 2015 in my town.", "Michael Fassbender absolutely slaughtered it, but how about Seth Rogen? He really surprised me in that it didn't distract me the entire time that I was watching Seth Rogen acting dramatically. Great stuff.", "I'm gonna be the negative Nancy in the room and say I didn't like most of it. The portrayals by the actors are excellent (specifically Fassbender in Act 3) but overall I just really didn't like it. At no part did I feel this had to be a movie (it honestly would be better as a play) and, I feel, the most interesting parts of his life are more or less skipped (the beginning with Woz and when he gets cancer). Just my two cents. ", "Wasn't a huge fan of this one to be honest. The movie had too much Sorkin for its own good and I felt like Boyle was pretty limited in his direction. The acting was superb but most of the dialogue just came across as awkward and forced. I think I came in expecting Social Network level of good but it doesn't really come close to meeting that mark. ", "The acting was phenomenal, but overall the movie was a major letdown to me...it got boring. The structure was a poor decision as it led to two hours of characters having the same fight with Jobs and Jobs proving he is a stubborn visionary asshole every time the door swings open. If that was all there is to him, it shouldn't have been turned into a biopic... I think a movie focusing on the Apple story more broadly would have been more interesting", "Briskly Walking While Having Important Conversations: The Movie", "prepared to get downvoted for this, but i had a bunch of issues with this film.\n\nPerhaps much of the success of The Social Network was due to David Fincher's directing ability. With this film, however, I don't think Danny Boyle was able to handle the Sorkin screenplay as well. That is, while both films have their fast-paced dialogue quips and other such Sorkin-core moments, Social Network at least had some more atmospheric moments that broke up the constant rush of action (the brief regatta scene comes to mind). \n\nThis film, however, felt entirely rushed to me. Every act had the same formula: follow Jobs in the moments before the next big Apple product unveiling, display tension between him and his co-workers, display tension between him and his family, display tension between him and the CEO character with flashback cuts to highlight some aspect of Jobs' visionary genius conflicting with the status quo of how companies are run/ computers are made, glue together with Apple news clips, repeat.\n\nIt was 3 nearly identical sequences copy-pasted one after the next for 2 hours. And because it's Aaron Sorkin, the whole thing is done at super-human speed.\n\nI felt physically tired by the second act.\n\nMichael Fassbender is the man, but I think his American accent wasn't exactly on point here.\n\nLastly, why the hell didn't anyone stop and ask Steve Jobs why the fuck he was putting his feet in the toilet right before the second presentation? I can understand why Sorkin/ Boyle would want to include something like that in the film, but why didn't another stop and say, \"hey, Steve, what the fuck are you doing that for?\" \n\n/end rant\n\n", "Didn't care for this film at all really.  There are some nice moments when discussing or involving his daughter Lisa.  The rest is absolute garbage. This movie does not capture Steve Jobs at all. Go watch the real guy in any of the multitude of clips or documentaries online and you'll see more of what he was really like.", "It's definitely a sort of spiritual successor to the Social Network. The cinematography and direction were incredible. The camera movement and the ability to show the abstract in a confined area reminded me most strongly of Birdman. The \"behind the scenes\" nature of it and long continuous scenes of constant dialogue also gave me Birdman vibes. \n\nThe movie was almost entirely dialogue, but the pacing was great. For a Sorkin script, I thought the characters were really well defined and nuanced. It didn't just feel like various outlets for Sorkin to share his views on stuff that he can sometimes fall into (though there was plenty of that). It really felt like a few distinct characters interacting.\n\nThere were some moments that really took me out of the movie. They poked fun at this in the movie but it was still a little convenient how just before each major launch, every major person in Jobs life wants to tell him something shocking for him to chew on and have to deal with, though the flashbacks that stemmed out of those conversations were really well integrated. It felt like a play, but it did feel like they had to sacrifice being realistic to create dramatic tension. But that's more of an observation than a complaint.  There were a few really egregious on-the-nose moments both in dialogue and direction telegraphing the subtext that took me out of the moment. But overall, for what does kind of work as a biopic (it's really more of a portrait) it was a really refreshing way to tell a life story. Kind of like how Love & Mercy bucks the biopic trend.\n\nI was not as blown away by Michael Fassbender as I know most people probably will be . I actually thought his American accent was pretty bad, it reminded me of Jude Law or Ewan McGreggor's American accents. He surprisingly looked the part, but I still never forgot that it was Fassbender acting, until the third act where he really disappeared. I actually kind of liked that Fassbender wasn't the powerhouse of the movie because it allowed Seth Rogen, the guy who plays Andy, Jeff Daniels, and Kate Winslett steal their respective scenes. \n\nRogen really disappeared into Woz, and he DOES do a normal laugh in the movie! He wasn't in it as much as I hoped, but Woz was handled really well and it was satisfying to see. I think the best performance was by Jeff Daniels though.\n\nI think Fassbender and the entire supporting cast deserve to be nominated. It's a probably a lock for being nominated for best screenplay, director, hopefully cinematography isn't looked over because it's all interiors, and best sound editing. The score and sound effects in this movie were remarkable. Great use of sound and music.\n\nOver all I'd give it an 8/10. It was great, but I still feel like Social Network is the better film.

He actually showed up to rehearsal because he thought that he was being scouted for a soccer team.\n\n-There were around 30-40 scouted kids that went through an intensive acting workshop and Abraham was always the one who stood out after each workshop.\n\n-Abraham's 1st kill was actually a scouting director who didn't find anyone and Cary said that the role was his punishment for not finding anyone.\n\n-Preparing for Agu's 1st kill was actually very technical. There was a tube of blood sticking out of the man's head (removed in post) and the machete actually wasn't there (also added in post).

This place we're in is not quite Ivory Coast, not quite Sierra Leone, not quite Uganda, but does borrow elements from those conflicts to paint an imaginary rebel bush war. This means that if you're a war-nerd like me, you're not nitpicking through the events (I'm looking at you Hotel Rwanda) but can sit back and experience the film fresh like the creators intended.\n\n\nThe opening is easily my favorite part of the movie. It's lovely. It's childhood in rural Africa, rendered in a way that felt reasonably realistic to me. I do some military training where myself and a large group of West African role players come together to recreate a similar fictional existence for exercising troops, and Beasts of No Nation hit pretty close to my experience. Honestly, even as a war nerd, I would have been happy watching another half an hour of Agu's childhood with the war only happening on the periphery. I think it's really important to have some positive experiences with a film like this that is going to take us to dark places.\n\n\n*The violence:* it was spot on. All the firearms felt like they had weight when shot, the selection of rifles carried by the rebels matched that \"cold war leftovers\" of small arms that seem to pervade rebel armies. The makeup team behind the blood and gore hit the right level of horrific, but not \"I have to stop watching this now\" and didn't dither into the mega-gore territory. Seriously, it seems like in a lot of war movies you can't have an explosion without hands/arms/legs being perfectly severed and flying through the air. We didn't fall into that here, but I still cringed.\n\n\n*Specifically the sexual violence.* I was thankful this movie played down the level of sexual violence, but didn't white-wash it either. I've read some pretty harrowing reports and first-hand-accounts in the past, and really don't want to see those played out on screen. We saw that it was an element of the war, and it repulsed us, but again: it wasn't graphic enough that I wanted to turn the TV off.\n\n\nThere were no white people! Okay, thats not quite true. There are two journalists that appear on screen for a fleeting instant, and have zero lines. Awesome. We get that sense of foreign voyeurism that the modern war correspondent gives us, without falling into all the white character tropes of other civil war movies. (Hardened mercenary, stalwart aid worker, embittered journalist, powerless ambassador/dignitary, you know the ones) The story was great being focused on Agu's experience. I didn't need some forced character with an external perspective to contextualize it.\n\n\nAnd finally, the surrender and collapse. The movie pumped us up for a possible assault on the capital. A big final battle that would win or lose the war and provide some excellent running through smoke, muted gunshots, ultimate showdown, etc. But we didn't get it. Instead we got the slow fizzle of entrenched positions, starvation, and insubordination. It was an excellent choice, because that's the much more realistic result. Most bush wars don't end neatly, and are instead reduced to a slow burn, still chewing up people and resources, but without the ebb and flow of major operations.\n", "I love how when he first starts as a child soldier, he talks to God quiet often, but over time he talks to God less and less and begins to question if God is watching him or not, finally he acknowledges the fact that god is not watching him, and instead he just addresses his mother. Such a powerful scene, shows he is still a kid on the inside, even after all hes done.", "Someone told me to post my interepration of the ending here as spoilers were okay so here goes,\n\nDuring the movie Agu talks about how it's too late for him to go back to being a child, he just wants to die and kind of accepts his life is over.  Towards the end Agu has become reclusive because he feels he can't go back to being normal and it isn't till he has that conversation with that lady that he can come to terms with himself.  He wants to be happy and he realizes he has to make an effort for his happiness.  He has so many bad memories that he doesn't want to stay in the past but to move on and the ending is him walking into the ocean to play with the kids as a sign of moving on.  He's going to try to move on and be accepted.  Also him going to the water can signal rebirth cleansing him of his sins.  It's a hopeful ending that Agu can find happiness finally.  It's open to interpretation but I feel the evidence points that he can finally move on.  In the book, I loved that he says he wants to be a doctor who he can make up for all the lives he took by saving lives.  I wish he said that but I guess in the arc of the movie, it was him finding acceptance  & peace.  He can finally be a kid again which he doubted he would ever be again.  The cynical ending goes with the other 2 kids who still believe in the cause.  They're past saving, some can be saved and some are lost.

Attah stole the majority of scenes he was in with Elba, which is saying something as Elba was incredible.  \n\nFukunaga did a great job directing, and the cinematography was stellar as per usual with him.\n\nAbsolutely amazing movie and I hope Netflix continues making movies.", "I saw it a couple weeks ago at the London Film Festival.\n\nApocalypse Now is an apt point of comparison for the effect of Beasts of No Nation, as well as Platoon and The Thin Red Line. Battered by explosions and gunfire, you come out of the film wearing the same thousand yard stare as its characters. At that point, it\u2019s easy to forget the delights of the first ten minutes as Abraham Attah\u2019s Agu playfully hustles his living, selling shells of television sets with his friends. It\u2019s not a perfect life, but the energy is reminiscent of the less dangerous sections of City of God. It\u2019s only from that light that the darkness hits hardess and invests you in Agu\u2019s plight and losses. However, this is as rocky as the rollercoaster gets. The next 2 hours is an absorbing barrage of misery and brutal dilemmas. The narrative thread is very loose, and perhaps some is lost in translation with the character\u2019s thick accents, but this is part of its point, especially in utilising child soldiers who won\u2019t know the ins and outs of what\u2019s going on anyway.\n\nThis aimlessness of the mission and the way that the war is so much bigger than the soldiers and battalions demonstrates that there is no way into peace from war. The kids are fighting for a future that they won\u2019t be able to find solace in, neither from eventual living and economical conditions, nor inner peace from the atrocities they\u2019ve committed. These bleak ideas hit hard. And like Malick\u2019s The Thin Red Line, a relationship with God in war is challenged. It\u2019s questioned whether it\u2019s possible or fair to have spiritual happiness after such sins. There is very poor foresight in war, and after only briefly touching a jarring scene where they visit the higher ups, it benefits no-one on the battleground. The film never preaches these messages, instead relying on the fact that we know how heartbreakingly true it is despite how far removed most of us will be.\n\nAbraham Attah absolutely disappears into his role. He\u2019s not showy, but just completely immersed in the film whether he\u2019s soaking in events or lashing out against them. He\u2019s easily the biggest discovery here. However, I expected great things from Elba after the hype and while he is good, it wasn\u2019t the tour de force performance I anticipated. That\u2019s just not how the character ended up being written. He has memorable moments but he teeters undefinably on the line between a manipulative villain and a manipulative mentor. He\u2019s no doubt an opportunist, but the film doesn\u2019t explore his character to the full extent, and the most dramatic moments are quite familiar as they\u2019re staples in other war films. Beasts stands out by having such a young boy other end of those dilemmas. Elba is perhaps too polished to go with the inherent rawness of the rest of the cast.\n\nFukunaga\u2019s cinematography is quite good, not boasting the same tricks as True Detective, but also clearly battling against the elements. It certainly has atmosphere. The style favours ambient music over montages of the war scenes and while that makes it flow together it also means that its surprises fall by the periphery. I can imagine that this will play well on Netflix, granted you give it full attention on a big HD television. The cinema projection does suffer from added graininess but that is rarely a problem via the internet and should compliment Fukunaga\u2019s cinematography a little more. I imagine that it will garner a divided reaction, with some finding it too hard to bare through the whole thing, but I can\u2019t imagine it getting much Oscar traction based on passion alone. It will be a pleasant and worthy surprise if it does score any nominations. At least an admirable effort that will be being remembered as one of the most notable war films of this decade.", "Was forced to watched this last night....MY GAWD, what a fantastic movie.

It felt like the movie my dad would fall asleep to on TNT, which is frustrating because if you look at the talent involved (Spielberg, the Coen Brothers, Tom Hanks) I expected to watch a great movie. \n\nC+ at best", "I'm a bit surprised by how much love this film is getting. I still had a pretty good time, but I though the 1st half was way way stronger than the 2nd half. The first half had Rylance's great performance, plenty of humor and great dialogue, interesting quandaries as Hanks' defense escalates, etc.\n\nAs soon as it shifts to East Berlin though, it just got boring. It just boiled down to Hanks running between people for about an hour. And given that the Abel and Powers exchange was a foregone conclusion, I didn't really care enough about whether the American student is part of the deal to actually feel any tension and suspense. Plus Powers as a character seemed kinda underdeveloped.\n\nWorth a watch, but i'd probably give it like a 6 or 7 out of 10.", "This movie surprised me. I went in expecting it to be good since it was Spielberg, the Coen bros., and Tom Hanks. I did not expect how invested in the movie I would become. Every scene felt important and powerful. The performances were exceptional. I loved everything about this movie and was astounded by how much I loved the film. This movie easily jumped into my top five of the year and I hope this movie does work at the Oscars.", "Pretty good stuff.  Not one of Spielberg's best, but still a respectable addition to his filmography.  1st act is definitely the best.  Rest of it is fine, but a little short on surprises. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are great, and so is the entire cast.  Could've used more Alan Alda though.  \n\nJohn Williams was sorely missed.  Nothing against Thomas Newman, but Williams is a legend.\n\nThought the romance between Donovan's daughter and his legal partner was weird.  It's brought up in the beginning and never mentioned again.  \n\nAll in all, a solid film made by reliable people.  It's not a big epic, but more of a good old fashioned story that could've been made in the '60s.  I give it a B+ or 8/10.\n\nThey should make a sequel where Donovan negotiates the exchange of prisoners from Bay of Pigs.  Call it ***Bridge of Pigs***.", "Solid movie. 8/10. The soviet spy was the best part of the movie.", "I love how Spielberg pays so much attention to detail and really draws his audience into the time period. Every shot felt so meticulously crafted, and it was beautiful. ", "I couldn't believe the good press this is getting.  I thought this was a pretty bad movie. \n\nCharacter development was fairly poor; we didn't have any contextual investment in pretty much anyone but Donovan, and even with him, his family life is totally two-dimensional, flat.  The CIA is portrayed as clueless and weak -- see the guys trying to get Donovan to focus on the mission, but then saying \"great, so we can ignore that phone call we got earlier... oh you know about the trade... no big deal... WHAT NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!\"  There was also no ethical/moral tension for any character other than Donovan -- nobody else in the movie feels conflicted or sees the difficulty of the situation.  The Judge has a \"to hell with ethics damn the commie spy!\" attitude, Donovan gives his impassioned speech, and we get no sense for any struggle at all that the judge has before changing his view point? \n\nThe dialog was generally pretty cheesy at times (not the whole way through), and sometimes they really just bludgeon you with the message.  When they disapproved of Donovan doing his job to defend the spy, every extra on the train gives a canned disapproving look.  Later, after we're all happy again, the woman on the train reads a news story about what a great guy Tom Hanks is, and then gives him... a knowing and approving look!  Look, kids climbing a fence and not being machine-gunned! America!  A news story about the negotiated exchange of spies causes a 9 your old to shit herself with excitement and say \"MOM COME LOOK AT THE TV!\" so we can be fed the nice resolution to the story.\n\nFurther, how are we supposed to feel any emotional investment in the rescue of the Americans when we have no backstory for them, essentially at all? \n\nAnyhow I'm ranting at this point, but I thought this movie had zero nuance and zero character development.", "It was OK, nothing great. Mark Rylance really stood out for the brief parts he was in. TBH, I felt like the movie was tonally very uneven. Some of the comedic parts just came out of nowhere, the huge shift in genre midway through, etc. I suspect that was an effect of the Cohen-involvement. I don't know, if they were directing then it probably would have worked better. Instead you have this mishmash of views between Spielberg and them.\n\n7/10", "I saw it, enjoyed it a lot and its beautifully made but it didn't grab me by the throat - a few days have passed and I'm already starting to forget it.", "I liked this film a lot less than I thought I would. It's incredibly well-directed, expertly written, and astonishingly well-acted, but I never found myself all that interested in the story.

", "As an ex-military pilot, I thought the U-2 shootdown scene was quite amazing. Maybe not entirely accurate, but fabulously filmed.  ", "So I haven't seen much discussion here about the subtleties of how Donovan won. The East Germans tried all these tricks to throw him off his game: the fake gang, the fake family, tossing him in jail, but he saw through them and realized that they were actually signs of desperation, and he figured out who had the real power, which is how he was able to make his final move. The whole time they thought they were manipulating him, he was actually reading them like a book.", "Unpopular opinion here; I was bored and fell asleep. I realized I was falling asleep and decided to let it happen. I made it about and hour-and-a-half in. It was just 2 old, white dudes talking for 75% of the movie and nothing they said was engaging enough for me to stay on board. Listen, obviously Hanks and Spielberg are legends whom I respect and they did their jobs well, it just lacked energy. And I missed the absence of traditional Coen quirkiness, but they didnt direct so I'll let it slide. For the record, I DID enjoy Mark Rylance's performance and found myself rooting for him. PS I found Lincoln boring too but DDL made it bearable. IMO Spielberg hasn't made a great movie since War of the Worlds.", "Just got out of it. Fantastic movie. I'm always a fan on historical pieces and this was beautifully paced. Tom hanks was fantastic as well as the actor playing the Russian spy. Highly recommend.

And the set design... Wow! ", "Loved the first half of the movie but it kinda lost momentum after the plane crash. Everything felt just so easily resolved.

Everyone I've talked to who has seen it claimed to not like the film because \"it wasn't scary.\" While there are horror elements, it wasn't meant to be a horror movie. Guillermo had stated over and over that it's a gothic romance. \n\nAs for my thoughts on the movie, I loved it. Everyone here had already mentioned its flaws so I just want to mention my favorite things about the film. First of all, holy shit this movie is beautiful. From the set pieces, to the costumes, to the colors and especially the design of the ghosts. Del Toro never fails to impress when it comes to the look of his films. Second, I've only seen Jessica Chastain mentioned so far but can we give credit to Tom Hiddleston's acting? I'm not the best judge of good or bad acting but I think his was phenomenal. I found myself tearing up at the his last scene with Chastain, when he told her \"us all,\" before she stabbed him in the face. It was repeatedly told and implied in the movie that he was damaged and under his sister's control but his reactions in that scene really told everything better than any other part of the movie did.", "I left the movie with the same feeling I had after watching Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage. Was everything real or imagined. To clarify. Was Crimson Peak something Edith really experiences or were we just living out her novel (which I believe was never given a name)? The scenery is like something you'd imagine right out of a Dean Kootz or Stephen King. The walls ran with clay as red as blood. The pure white snow soaked more red the more the truth was revealed. This is a movie that you could watch over and over and find some new meaning to things. \n\nI personally believe we are in the story she wrote or her writing is just super meta. The Mr. Sharp only truly exists until she's required by the publisher to include a love story. The ghosts are indeed metaphors to the past, and indeed the story is not so much a ghost story but a story with ghosts in it.\n\nI think the trailers presented it like it would have jump scares and does it a disservice.  I've always admired Guillermo's stories for having the horror in plain sight. The ghosts even grotesque as they are pale in comparison to the horrors caused by the charming and attractive sharps. \n\nMaybe I'm over analyzing? Who cares. I loved the movie. ", "Okay am I crazy or was Hiddleston as a ghost with the blood floating away from his wound a direct homage to the Devil's Backbone?", "I walked out thinking, \"Wow, Vincent Price could have been in that!\" I didn't expect the throwbackiness of the movie but really enjoyed it. I have no idea how it will play with the \"I won't watch movies made before 1970\" crowd.\n\nI can't argue with people saying the storyline is simple. I agree, but that either bothers you or it doesn't and for me it doesn't. I loved the metaness of Edith's writing. Ghosts are in the story but it's not a ghost story. Check. The ghosts are just metaphors for the past. Check. The stodgy old man tells her she needs a love story. Check.", "Any one else pick up the Enola name as backwards for alone to mean \" not alone\" ? \n\nThat was literally the key to hear from the others' stories and reassure that she was not the only one.\n", "I am already planning a second viewing of this film, as I'm now a major fan. I ended up seeing it in IMAX, and I don't regret it for a second. The scenes inside the house made it worth it alone. Anyways, here are my top few reasons for why I enjoyed this hit-or-miss film so much: \n\n1) I happen to be a major Gothic-lit fan, and this came across as a cinematic love letter to the likes of Bronte, Du Maurier, and Radcliffe. Everything from the campy-romantic bits, the rich costumes, the class struggles, and of course *that house*!! It truly was a Gothic Romance, complete with a creepy woman in the attic. What some will view as weaknesses in the plot, I saw as almost hallmarks of the Gothic genre. And I totally understand people not liking it! Heck, Jane Austen wrote an entire novel poking fun at that particular genre--so you're in good company. It can be a little too absurd and awkwardly paced for some, and that's okay. I just happen to find that sort of thing fun, which this movie was for me!  \n\n2) It was stunning. Pure, grotesque beauty, that only Del Toro can produce with such consistency. :)\n\n3) **The House**! It was its own character that has an incredible influence on the plot, which is *exactly* what should happen in a Gothic novel. Hell, it's the whole reason we call that genre \"gothic\" in the first place! The sounds, the oozing iron ore, the infestation of moths, and secrets in virtually every nook and cranny of the place. What first appears to be a death trap and constant source of horror for our bride, ends up being her greatest asset and life-saving force. \n\n\nI understand why some folks won't like this film. The Gothic genre has always been pretty over the top and a little ridiculous! But that's what makes it fun for some of us. :) \n\nOverall, I'm giving it an 8/10. It is exactly what the director promised, and he certainly delivered for this fan. ", "Jessica Chastain was so deliciously fucked up and fun. My favorite part of the film, besides the production design. I want her to be in every movie swinging a cleaver covered in blood.", "I went in knowing that the horror part wasn't supposed to be based on scariness, so the \"jumpscare\" moments didn't bother me, although they did feel unnecessary.  I would have preferred to keep the ghostly imagery that sometimes appeared, minus the sudden rise in the music.  That way, you could wonder, \"Wait, did I just see something?\"\n\nThe horror mostly came from the overall content of the movie.  I KNEW there was something messed up with Lucille and Thomas, but I didn't realize just how messed up.  And, hours later, I'm still mulling over the little psychotic moments and the overall disgusting-ness.  I'm still figuring out just how evil Lucille was.\n\nMaybe the foreshadowing of Edith saying, \"It's not a ghost story; it's a story with a ghost in it,\" was a little ham-handed, but I forgot about it until the movie was over.\n\n7/10 overall, 8/10 as a (fantasy) horror film.", "I fear Game of Thrones has desensitized me to the shock of incest...", "It was campier than I thought it'd be and dull at points but visually it was stunning with it's colors and concepts. Worth the IMAX experience. ", "I really loved it. I can't help but be stunned by the meticulous beauty Guillermo del Toro brought to life in Crimson Peak. It's a grand melodrama, and I enjoyed every bit of it.\n\nI like the meta commentary towards the beginning of the film when Edith said her manuscript wasn't a ghost story, but rather a story with ghosts in it serving as metaphors. Aside from the final appearance of Thomas, the ghosts don't really *need* to be a part of the story. It's just much more fun to have those wonderfully realized specters rattling the chains in that house of otherwise earthly horrors.\n\nThe cast was terrific, but I was especially impressed with Jessica Chastain. Not since Eva Green have I seen an actress so effectively convey that kind of unhinged feminine fury. Lucille is a frightening character, but also sympathetic. You could see how legitimately hurt she was that her brother was being unfaithful to her, and the loss of him made all the horror she'd wrought and endured unbearable. Lucille's line about not stopping until she or Edith was dead made it clear that she was bent on self destruction as much as revenge. And that final shot leaves us with an image of Lucille as the eternally tragic figure she always was instead of the villain she had long been.\n\nI find it interesting in an odd way that incest has become such a common subject matter in entertainment that I assumed almost from the start that the Sharpe siblings were secretly lovers. It was smart to have Edith be so naive about such a thing that she thought it meant Lucille wasn't really Thomas's sister, and then to add the revelation that the baby was hers. Both of those choices made sure their relationship was as shocking as it should be.", "The three first surprising ghost-related moments of the movie were shown in the trailer.\n\n1. When Edith's mother grabs her arm in the opening scene\n2. When the ghost's face appears and slams the closet door shut that Edith is holding\n3. When the ghost crawls out of the floor screaming\n\nI wish I didn't know the floor one was coming. That would have been so surprising but I was like \"This is the scene from the trailer...here it comes...there it is...meh..\"", "Having now seen the movie twice (early screening and late night showing tonight), I feel like this movie has been incredibly overlooked by critics so far.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a long told narrative \u2013 woman loses her father, relocates to spooky house with spooky people \u2013 but calling it clich\u00e9 suggests Del Toro did it in an effort to land on an original idea and fell short. It\u2019s a continuation of a genre, and one distinctly from his hand.\n\nWhat generally separates him from the pack is character beats that, grand or not, have a huge impact. And straight-up, Lucille Sharpe is one of the most fascinating, heartbreaking characters I\u2019ve seen on screen this year. Murderous or not, she and her brother are the victims of circumstance, an abusive mother and an aggressively abusive father keeping them confined to a small corner of a cavernous home. When they find that the only thing they have is each other, their romance is thwarted by their mother. That they respond by killing her is, while horrible, ultimately unsurprising. \n\nWhen Thomas is showing Edith the toy room upstairs, and we see the joy on his face, you get the sense that these are two still infantile people who have struggled to hang on to something that could never be, committing the \u201chorror for love\u201d that Lucille talks about. So long as she remains in control, Lucille appears diabolically evil (eg, when she gets twisted satisfaction in pushing Edith off the balcony). But when things fall apart, even in the early moments when she feels the need to ask Edith indirectly if she consummated her relationship, you start to see that she\u2019s a sad, desperate woman who hasn\u2019t changed since she and Thomas were kids, trying to cling to her love no matter the cost.\n\nThis makes the biggest gross-out scene of the movie also one of the most emotionally resonant, as Lucille stabs Thomas in the face with the knife. You watch any desire to be alive leave her as she screams in agony over losing Thomas. Before she even killed him, she knew he was already gone, and that without love, as Thomas points out shortly before, they were long dead, sad lonely kids hanging onto a broken home.\n\nDel Toro combines setting, character, and violence for his emotional/symbolic/thematic beats as well as anyone working today. The beautiful, decaying atmosphere and visceral ghosts shift from resonating as spooky to sad after a first viewing, yet the blood and clay-soaked knife fight between flowing gowned women in the surrounded by corpses of the past women in the home still reads as bonkers fun however you slice it. Del Toro takes huge budgets and, no matter the context, is entirely uncompromising in his narrative, characters, overall world, etc. He directs his actors remarkably well, giving incredibly rich parts to several of them, and considering how this movie looks compared to past work even though he switched DPs, he could probably shoot a movie himself at this point. So yeah, maybe it won\u2019t leave you with lingering nightmares (though it has its creepy moments, no doubt), but it\u2019s the work of a masterful storyteller at the top of his game.", "A few points about this movie I'd like to make:\n\n1. I love that you can give a completely different synopsis based on who you're trying to bring to the movie. Have a girlfriend who likes Victorian romance? \"A lonely heiress meets a struggling baronet who wants to rebuild his land, yet has a dark secret. Unbeknownst to him, she has a dark secret as well.\"\nWhat about the rest of us? \"A sisterfucker uses creative fundraising ideas and a passion for high quality brickwork to rebuild the land his father destroyed. Also there's ghosts.\"\n\n2. Speaking of Game of Thrones, that show really took the wind out of the old incest sails.\n\"So you're not his sister?\"\n\"No I totally am!\"\n\"Oh, gross, I guess.\"\n\n   BONUS: The sister literally said, \"The things we do for love,\" then shortly afterwards pushed someone from a great height onto snow covered ground.\n\n3. There were so many times I felt like I was watching Pride and Prejudice, then suddenly someone's face was violently smashed, stabbed, sliced, or a clay covered ghost baby was whispering to me. 8/10.\n\nEDIT: STOP! Grammar time.", "Misleading trailers, but I enjoyed the film. ", "It's sad how much Hollywood keeps kicking del Toro in the balls. This movie was so beautiful to look at and he has such a wonderfully creative mind. I hope PR2 isn't completely dead in the water", "I thought it was a beautifully macabre film. I personally found the story a bit slow, and predictable towards the end, but still interesting enough to keep me involved. I loved that the house was a living, breathing and even bleeding entity. The production design, as you'd expect from Del Toro, is amazing. \n\nI really enjoyed the scene where Lucille was telling Edith about the butterflies and moths; the butterflies being beautiful yet fragile and dying without sun, while the black moths are unseemly, yet durable creatures feeding on the butterflies. To Lucile, Thomas and her are the black moths that will consume Edith, the fragile butterfly.", "Okay. I loved the crap out of this movie. It was beautiful, it was heart wrenching, everyone's acting was glorious. The only thing that bugged me? \n\nThe leaves!!! They keep falling through the hole in the roof and where did they come from? They didn't come from trees because the only tree in the general vicinity of the property was the one anorexic looking tree near where Edith plays with the dog, and that tree was far too small and scrawny to produce the sheer number of leaves that were falling through the roof. This has bugged the crap out of me since I saw the movie last night. ", "While I wouldn't factor it into a review, did anyone feel very deceived by the marketing? Since the ghost didn't really do a whole lot to affect the story, this barely felt supernatural. Even the blood on the snow was really just clay. I thought they were feeding people to to house to stay immortal or something, but it was kinda disappointing on that end. Overall it was visually great but had several sloppy plot points. ", "Really surprised at the negative reaction to this. It was more dumb fun than I was expecting (something like Pan's Labyrinth), but the story wasn't bad by any means. I was never bored, and even though I had guessed they were in an incestuous relationship and such, I was always intrigued by the mystery. The dumbest lines of dialogue are so overdone in the writing and acting that it has to be intentional, and basically serves as the film's comedic relief. (\"I knew you weren't really his sister,\" \"Oh sweet Edith: I AM!\" It brought such a big smile to my face.)\n\nThere's so many touches in the costumes and set, you can't breathe it all in one viewing. The deaths were all fucking INCREDIBLY well done, they'll stick with me for a long time. The monster designs were a little weaker for the ghosts, but Lucille is one of the best monsters del Toro's made. I usually roll my eyes at irises, but ALL of the ones in this movie were super effective. And it's not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty spooky. Really creepy vibe from the arrival at Allerdale Hall on, and a lot of tense moments (like the swapping of the keys).\n\nIt's my favourite this year so far, and second only to Pan in terms of del Toro's filmography for me (I haven't seen Cronos or Devil's Backbone).", "I enjoyed how everything was pragmatic and grounded in nature. The Sharpe's fortune being squandered. Their abusive relationships. It sets a backdrop where violent con artists works. Even the machine turning out to be nothing more than a failing mining project to try to restore their fortune and get some use out of a worthless plot of land.\n\n\nEven the ghosts are fairly grounded as far as these things go. Their knowledge makes sense. The ghost shows Edith the wax cylinders because she placed them there. The ghost holding the baby points her towards the affair because she knows it is happening. As far as supernatural mumbo jumbo goes it kept everything pretty tight. Except one thing that I keep going back to.\n\n\nWhat was Edith's Mothers connection to Crimson Peak? Her first warning comes when Edith is very young. This would have been around the time Lucille murdered her mother. Well before the Sharpe children had even begun working out a con. When Edith's mother revisits her and warns her a second time it makes a little more sense as Thomas is waiting outside and already working to win over Edith's affection. The first visit, however, stands in stark contrast to the grounded nature of the ghosts knowledge in all other cases.\n\n\nWe know that both Sharpe parents travelled and that their father lost their fortune slowly. It is possible that the Sharpe parents and Edith's parents had some connection but if it was direct then Carter (Edith's father) would have known.\n\n\nThe ghost having some sort of special supernatural knowledge doesn't sit well with me since they went to painstaking efforts to give reason to everything else that happens. It is possible the connective tissue is not revealed to the audience, but all the hinting of what is going on, like the scene in the library where Lucille shows Edith the book and comments about secrets, suggests that even if it is not revealed there is definitely a reason that was worked out.\n\n\nMaybe years from now on a successor site to reddit I will read a fan theory that pieces it together.", "I think like Pacific Rim, the visuals are amazing, inventive and stylish- but the script is simply not up to scratch. \nI appreciated what it was going for, but being a camp melodrama doesn't excuse your movie from having such simplistic, borderline boring dialogue.\n\nBut Tom Hiddleston's ass is shown in it, so 10/10", "6/10\n\nActing over all was good. Chastain was my favourite. I've been liking her more and more lately. \n\nThe cinematography was the best and stood out the most. Lots to look at and take in. \n\nThe story overall was average and a little predictable. \n\nI don't think the \"scares\" were very effective. I thought most of them were just really loud noises used to make you jump. It took an hour to even get into the house. There were some genuinely creepy moments of cgi and cinematography. But there could have been more. \n", "I really like the movie and it is really a breath of fresh air. It's great to see a movie come out around October that isn't really a horror movie and focuses on building a world, atmosphere, and characters. In a way, it reminds me of Only Lovers Left Alive. I get that if you are expecting a horror movie or aren't expecting a slow-moving love story, there is a good chance you won't really like this. Mia Wasikowska's character's story that she writes is a ghost story with a love story added into it and this movie is a love story with supernatural elements added to it.", "Anyone else think the ending was really stupid? Like, she's supposed to be near death from poisoning, plus a broken leg, but she's running around and smashing heads with a shovel. This type of thing wouldn't usually bother me, but if she was weaker and sicker trying to run away it would have been more intense.\n\nProduction design was incredible, of course, and I did like the first act a lot (probably had a lot to do with Jim Beaver). I feel like this movie deserved a better script.", "Pros:\n\n* Probably the coolest/scariest looking ghosts ever put to film\n\n* Amazing set design.  Anytime they were in the main foyer with stuff falling through the ceiling, I was in awe.  Costumes were great as well and made the most out of its time period.\n\n* Fantastic cinematography.  So glad I saw it in IMAX, there were so many fantastic images to look at throughout.  Can't think of a single shot that didn't suck me in to the story and setting.\n\n* Tom Hiddleston is a good actor.\n\n* Jessica Chastain continues to prove she's one of the best working actresses.  If she was the villain in every movie, I certainty wouldn't complain.  \n\n* Cute dog\n\nCons:\n\n* Charlie Hunnam continues to prove he's one of the worst working actors.\n\n* Mia Wasikowska confirms what we all knew after Alice in Wonderland that she shouldn't be a lead actress.\n\n* Kind of lame that the villains' motivation was just to get money.  You've got fucking ghosts in your movie, have some sort of cool supernatural driving force.\n\n* \"It's not a ghost story, it's a story with ghosts in it.  It's a metaphor for the past.\"  Wow nice subtle storytelling there, Guillermo.\n\nPeople who were expecting a straight up horror movie probably haven't seen very much Del Toro.  It's very much in line with Pan's Labyrinth and The Orphanage of using supernatural elements, but not telling a horror story.  Not as good as either one of those movies, and the writing was a little choppy, but the performances, sets, costumes, and amazing ghost design made it for me.  Much better than Pacific Rim and I hope this makes good money so Del Toro can keep getting funding for his 20 million projects.\n\n8/10  ", "The movie was beautiful. The story was shit", "I loved it! I read the leaked script a while ago and thought the ending was weak, so I was so pleased that they had rewritten most of it and it was much better.\n\nThe set and costumes are some of the best I had ever seen. I can't wait for it to be released on blu-ray, so I can pause scenes and absorb everything in the house.\n\nJessica's performance was also very impressive and intense. I really liked how she never blinked and the way she would just explode with rage. Would love to see her get noticed come awards season, but I feel like this will only get nominated for costume and production design (which it should!) I thought everyone else played their characters well, but weren't overly impressive.\n\nIt's got me on a Vincent Price kick now (currently watching Fall of the House of Usher), before I go to see it again this weekend.", "I went into the movie hearing that it IS NOT a horror movie, but more of a Gothic romance. With that preconception in place, I absolutely loved it. The story sucked me in, and the visuals and acting were amazing. Some great imagery from del Toro too, par for the course.", "So I watched Chris Stuckmann's review before seeing it and he made an observation about how this movie has a scene with an unnatural \"orgy of evidence\" as coined by Minority Report. I would say overall I enjoyed most aspects of the film but holy shit did the scene in question bother me to no end. Maybe I'm not understanding something but when Edith finds the recordings in the case I just wondered to myself why that stuff even existed. When and why was it recorded and more importantly why did they not just destroy it? It felt like it came out of nowhere. This movie needed more of Edith piecing things together instead of essentially dumping the whole thing on use at once.", "I thought the directing was fucking phenomenal. The choice of shots, angles, music, color, editing was on par with the best. No complaint there. Even the pacing, which was slow at first, really picked up in the second half.\n\nMy biggest issue was with the storytelling itself. It was repetitive and the exposition got overbearing at points. It was pretty slow and didn't really grab me the way it should have. It wasn't anything new and the story was pretty boring at points. Del Toro should have a writer work with him or direct other scripts.\n\nI give it a 7/10. Could've been better but just wasn't the homerun it could've been.", "I joked with my SO that a after credits scene should have taken place modernish day then a knock on the door front door of crimson peak and bam it's Hellboy with the B.P.R.D .", "I absolutely loved it. I doubt there will be a more gorgeous-looking film than this that we'll see this year. The elaborate production design and lighting was simply stunning.\n\nI also love how the entire film feels like it was made from the 30s. The deliberate pacing, slow build-up, and simple story all feels like a product of a much earlier decade, but shot with a sophisticated, modern look. Not everyone will be a fan of this for sure, but I personally loved it all. The bloody, insane climax felt all the more rewarding because of the build-up.", "Most disappointing film of 2015 so far, though I have to admit I suspected it would have a lackluster plot from the very first trailer. I imagine if this wasn't directed by Del Toro the general attitude towards it would be a lot more negative. I feel like he's getting a lot of leeway. PLEASE, Guillermo, don't make another cheesy throwback film next and use your talents on something original and worthy.\n\nPros:\n\n- Oscar-worthy production design & costumes\n\n- Performances: Chastain, Hiddleston very good in particular.\n\n- The bit where Hiddleston says \"You're a doctor, tell me where to do it\" was the best bit of writing/acting in the whole movie.\n\n- Cracking cinematography & score.\n\nCons:\n\n- Generic plot that's totally predictable from start to finish\n\n- Cardboard characters, especially Hunnam's\n\n- WTF was up with Hunnam's accent? I swear he kept wavering between Irish and American.\n\n- It's not scary at all. Very reliant on jump scares.\n\n- Doesn't make much use of its R-rating, a few neat moments aside.\n\n- Though the film LOOKED good I don't think that had much to do with del Toro's direction. I thought a lot of the shot selections were very boring and I felt like I was watching a very expensive TV movie. The smaller aspect ratio probably didn't help.\n\n- We should try to separate a movie from its marketing but I can see why people are upset that they paid to see a horror movie and got something with much more romance in it.\n\nI find it a bit frustrating that many will hand-waive these complaints because \"del Toro intended it to be cheesy/campy\". But we shouldn't settle for such low-effort writing. This film could've been so much better.\n\n5/10", "Thought the movie was great. definitely don't agree with the negative reaction in here. ", "I just came from the theater, so I'm still digesting a bit but here are my initial thoughts.\n\nI totally agree with all the comments about visual effects, color, etc. Really a cool movie to watch. The atmosphere is finished off with an excellent score that chills you at all the right moments.\n\nI was a little disappointed in the end by the characters. I felt like Edith totally lost her character as the film went on--she is introduced as being someone very sharp, but we hardly see it before she is dulled; what I mean to say is, once she gets into the house, her character for the first half of the movie is totally erased.  I would have really liked to see her personality a little more throughout.\n\nThe ending felt very anti-climactic to me. I think it would have been more satisfying to show or suggest what it would be like for Lucille's ghost to be now sharing the house with the *ghosts of all those people she murdered.* I would have really liked for that to be played up--Lucille is not alone there. \n\nMy last thought: I wish the title was different. Midway through, when it is revealed to Edith that Allerdale Hall = Crimson Peak, it was a very meh moment for the audience. It was really obvious already that she was at Crimson Peak, so what could have been a moment of intrigue felt like nothing to me.", "I thought this movie was excellent. It continues to linger in my mind, and I feel the movie is not getting fair reviews from critics. The acting was pretty well-done by the whole cast, I thought the writing was on par (mostly due to the ham-fisted exposition), but like some of you have said the film is a throwback to classic Gothic stories and the writing suffers from having to cater to a modern audience and this caused a few giggles in the theater. The direction,  cinematography, production design were spectacular. I honestly though all the characters were believable. Edith was tormented from the death of her father, and fell in love with Thomas, thus causing her need to leave America. Thomas was her savior, and in the end I felt satisfaction from the fact that they both were in love. Lucille was a tormented soul, she was insane, and acted on pure selfishness by using Thomas. Even Alan was a quasi-Sherlock Holmes type as evidenced by his collection of Arthur Conan Doyle novels, and his investigation into Edith's whereabouts and I was happy he survived. Overall I loved this movie. 4.5/5", "I think the story severely lacked in almost every aspect.. The main character was an absolute idiot..I didn't like how things were thrown in my face as if I were child and couldn't deduce the answer on my own.. I predicted everything that occurred.. The visuals were amazing though, and I really enjoyed watching Lucille!", "Not a horror film, but indeed, very visually stunning. My friends hated it, but I thought it was OK. I didn't appreciate the jump scares and I figured out the twist early on. I loved the attire, especially Edith's wedding dress. With her hair down and in a nightgown, she totally looked like Carrie.  \nRandom, but subscribers of /r/penmanshipporn should see this. ", "As someone with anxiety, I hate horror films but love them because I hate keeping my eyes closed half of the film but part of the thrill is the scariness. It felt good to be able to relax for once, and when I quickly realized it wasn't meant to be a horror film (such as when she emphasizes that it is a story with a ghost that happens to be in it), I relaxed and thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nThe performances were great and Mia is really wonderful. It was fairly predictable once you read into the body language and what the characters say, but nonetheless it was refreshing and made for a good story. \n\nAt times it felt like it dragged on a bit, and Lucille just started to piss me off towards the end (but that was most likely intentional). Regardless, it was one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen and it was hard to focus on just one thing when everything was so detailed and stunning. \n\nPretty good movie but the visuals were better than the story. Usually I hate that and feel directors compensate for a lacking storyline with overbearing visuals, but everything was done right. \n\nEDIT: just occurred to me that in the beginning, she said she would rather die a widow like Mary Shelley, and she did. \n\n7.5/10", "Although Del Toro is amazing at cinematography and visuals, and Tom Hiddleston's and Jessica Chastain's acting is superb in this, I still felt that this movie wasn't so good. This movie was marketed as a horror movie and it was not that at all. I mean the ghost portion of it was almost completely useless to the plot. It is a Victorian-romance, but I don't care for the characters at all, except for the ones mentioned above, and that really takes away from the movie. Aside for the meh plot and the shitty marketing, the visuals are stunning, but gameplay > graphics. It's a shame because I really wanted to like the movie too. ", "Visually amazing, but the story really fell flat. The ghosts were completely superficial and existed only to underline a pretty boring and flat crime story that's been around for 200 years. Decent, but it's no Pan's Labyrinth.", "I loved this - finally, a worthy follow up to *Pan's Labyrinth*! It's not perfect [spoilers](#s \"like seriously... A surprise incest twist? yawn.\")  but it's definitely hanging around on my mind. The World he builds is so gorgeous - a house that forever rains leaves and snow on the inside; walls and snow that seep with red clay; and those Ghosts, which are so damn cool - almost like the dementors from Harry Potter... but creepier.\n\nI loved the way this was shot. The smooth, sweeping long takes really enhanced the horror of the moment, with clever use of space and a limited point of view. Also, I'm a big fan of Wasikowska, and she's again great here. I think she puts Hiddleston to shame, who, although was really quite funny, fell short with his range. \n\nDel Toro reaches sparingly into the cheap tricks bag. It was really refreshing to see a nice, balanced horror. And call me a geek, but I just loved all the throwbacks and homages to old(er) horrors. The shadowy hands moving accross the wall (*Nosferatu*), and the ball being rolled along the ground from no where (*the Shining*). There were a bunch of Hitchcock's in there, and a heap more I'm not remembering, but it'll be fun to go back and pick them out. \n\nOh, and the violence! It's like Del Toro had to one-up the bottle-to-the-face scene in *Pan's Labyrinth* over and over and over again. I loved it... in a sick way.

And that border scene was my favorite part of the movie. Wow", "Adapted from a post I made a couple of weeks ago immediately after seeing the film:  \n  \nThings that stood out to me in the film:  \n- The way Villeneuve lingers on some images that shock you puts you in Kate's perspective. Like how in Juarez for the first time, the missing-persons posters behind Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro) are still in focus but behind Kate the background is shallow, emphasising how she's still out of her depth as to what she's gotten into but Alejandro is perfectly in-tune as far as his motivations go.  \n  \n- The acting was mesmerising. Everyone brought their A-Game, Josh Brolin was aloof yet intense and really brought a strong sense of his character, Matt's M.O. as someone who relishes this 'game' of life and death but doesn't play by the rules.  \n  \n- I went in expecting Emily Blunt to be strong and own the screen but...she didn't. It really bothered me that her character wasn't as strong as I thought she'd be but slowly over the course of the film and even after, it slowly dawns on you how brilliant her performance as Kate Macer is. My disappointment in her is exactly how she feels herself...she thought she's strong, effective and can handle it with the best but quickly she realises she's lost, overwhelmed and way in over her head. There's a stinging itch that urges you to scream at her to be stronger and you feel that disappointment by the end thanks to her fantastic performance.  \n  \n- And then there's Benicio...this is his movie. I would say that his character, Alejandro, is 'comfortably intense'. The film misdirects you to believe this is a movie centred on Kate Macer, but it isn't. It's actually about Alejandro. Everyone has motives driven by vague concepts of morals or societal-good but it is Alejandro's character that has a truly vested interest in the outcome and he carries it through. You notice towards the second half of the film that it's very much Alejandro's show. That's why the movie is called Sicario. It's Alejandro.  \n  \n- Roger Deakins' cinematography...don't need to say much. Gritty but so beautiful. Immersive yet overwhelming at times. In other words, close to perfect.  \n  \n- Props to Taylor Sheridan for a fucking masterpiece of the script. Lean, intense and slim on exposition it drives a story of misplaced trust, morally ambiguous characters and the overwhelming brutality of the drug wars.  \n  \n- The last scene where Kate pulls the gun on Alejandro from the balcony. He half-turns to acknowledge her, but then fully turns to face her confidently. He's not being alpha, he's facing her front on because he's come full circle. He's avenged his family so if he dies there and then he would have no regrets or unfinished business. ", "Amazing film. And when the fuck did del toro start to look like brad Pitt?", "A wild Jon Bernthal appears.", "Having never seen any other Denis Villeneuve films until Sicario, this movie got me REALLY excited for Blade Runner 2.", "This is one of my favorite films of the year. Not since Zero Dark Thirty have I enjoyed a political action film. The action was sublimely choreographed and shot, the story was compelling and every actor brought something awesome to the film. Benicio was great but goddamn I loved Brolin's character. That confident swagger and nonchalance was perfect.", "Just saw the film at Arclight Los Angeles and loved it. Was better that what I had expected. Soundtrack, acting, and cinematography turned a dull script into a masterpiece. \n\nI did have one issue with the script. When Manuel Diaz gets pulled over while driving his Mercedes S-Class in Mexico on the way to the Cartel boss is house why does he stop? I'm assuming the car is a Mercedes S550 which would easily outrun a Ford Crown Victoria. Manuel should know the cops are on someones payroll. I just don't see the logical reason for him to stop on a dark road in Mexico. If it was a dark road in the United States I can see the reasoning easily, but Mexico, no, especially the situation he was in. I'm guessing his character was under estimating the situation and probably assumed the cop was pulling him over for a simple shake-down, but even then just seems like a waste of his time for him given that he is connected to the cartel plus the given situation he is in. \n\nI liked how Kate was the voice of reason. I just hated how she expressed her views, \nKate could have played the game a little smarter. Instead of yelling out, \"I'm going to tell everyone what you did\" She should have kept her intentions to herself. Just paints a target on her back from all sides. She also got a bit overzealous at the bank. She should understand the overall investigation has a bigger picture. Same thing when Kate is about to have sex with Ted and she see's the rubber-band/bracelet. If Kate reacted more calmly/smoothly to the situation with Ted it would have saved her some stress. I'm not against Kates moral reasoning, just the way she goes about enforcing said moral reasoning. Kate is not a wolf yet, just a cub. ", "I've never been so tense watching a movie as I was there. Don't really know what I was expecting heading into that theater, but it wasn't that. What an amazing film ", "One of the most brilliant performances was **Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez** as the state cop, Silvio. I think the *lack* of dialogue made it even more powerful. So much was said without words about the relationship between he and his wife and his son. It was the perfect metaphor for the movie. \n\nHis wife represents the truth and knows the truth in all its horror but understands her husband has to do what he does to provide for his family - this is also represented by both the characters, Alejandro Gillick and Matt Graver. \n\nSilvio's son represents the innocence. The people who are not *in the know*... 99% of Americans and ultimately even Kate Macer (she thought she was in the know, but eventually found out she didn't know shit). The innocent are like blind sheep who will either continue to be fattened up or be led to the slaughter, either way, we don't know until it's too late.\n\nSilvio represented Mexico (to me Mexico was more than just a setting in the film, it was a character). Geographically, it's just in the right place at the right time. Mexico doesn't have a choice in the matter to be at the center of this brutal war. Silvio *has no choice*. He either does this or he and his family are dead. He knows it. He wants only the best for his family and to better his life, but has no say in the means to do so. When Alejandro tells him at the end, (paraphrasing) \"You're doing this for your son.\" before executing him, Silvio knows he is right. And ultimately, when Mexico is taken out of the equation and the war is moved back to Columbia, his family will be safe. So, his sacrifice will be worth it. Because he was only doing what he was doing to provide for his family. He knew he was already dead anyway. \n\nFuck, though, this was a fucking head trip. Sicario is like Traffic to the 10th power.

There's nothing here I haven't seen in tons of other films, but the cinematography, acting, and directing are a big step up from your average cartel film.

I've been a huge del Toro fan since The Hunted and I think he's an amazing actor, so I definitely focused on him throughout the movie. I guess I don't have any clear point to make, just wanted to discuss!\n\n He kinda began as being the cliche 'silent bad ass type,' then we hear about his back story from Brolins character in the tunnel raid scene, which adds some depth to him finally. He was *super* sleek and bad ass as the lone wolf from the tunnel raid on, and I'm really glad we finally got to see him in action. It's so cool to see experts at anything, and it was enthralling to watch this expert hit man at work. \n\nI've been digesting the movie since i saw it earlier today, and I was kinda thinking that i was disappointed at how \"simple\" it was I guess. I can't think of a better way to explain it, but like lots of people on here have been saying, it's not really anything new that we're seeing but it's definitely really well done. Just going over all the little details of the movie in my mind though I guess i started to pick a little deeper, and was thinking about why Taylor Sheridan chose Reggie's background to include going to law school. And I guess my theory is that he wrote it that way to show the audience what del Toro's character may have been like before he lost his family (they mentioned Alejandro being a lawyer before he lost his fam a couple times if im not mistaken).\n\nWhen they were having the meeting about choosing Blunts character at the beginning, Brolins character was immediately turned off by the idea of having Reggie, a lawyer, on the team. Most likely because they're gona do a bunch of immoral and illegal stuff to complete their task, as we end up seeing throughout the movie. Earlier in his life when he was in Colombia, Alejandro was probably just like them. In the scene right before they go to Juarez, Alejandro and Kate stay after the briefing is over, and all the tough guys are gone, and she asks him about who he is/what he's doing there etc. He tells her in the end she's going to find out on her own, just like he did. (Just another thing to add, I also thought it was interesting that Brolins character and Alejandro probably would have hated each other in their earlier lives because Alejandro would have been one of the law abiding idealists like Kate and Reggie.)\n\nAnyway, we see how conflicted Kate and Reggie are over what's going on, and in the scenes with Alejandro and Kate, I think he see's not only his daughter, but himself. In the dinner scene the bad guy asks him what his wife would think of what he's become, and even though it doesn't phase him then, in the middle of his violent rampage, I think we get to see his sorrow in the final scene where he goes to make Kate sign the paper. And I like to think his advice to Kate, about moving to a small town to escape the 'land of the wolves,' is what he's going to do now that he's had his vengeance. \n\nHe no longer wants to be a wolf either, and I think that's what del Toro did such a great job at showing us through out the movie with his amazing performance. His character seemed reluctant to do the things he was doing throughout the whole movie. When they catch Guillermo Alejandro meets an old friend in the hallway before going into interrogation, and acts like a guy who has to head back to work after a lunch break. \n\nIn the scene where they have the dude who tries to kill Kate he seems so annoyed to have to keep asking this guy about the dirty cops. Wiping his bloody hands on his shirt, and then finally just grabbing the phones and sitting on the guy while he goes through his contacts, i was cracking up. \n\nAfter thinkin about all of the details, I guess the movie was a lot deeper to me than at first glance, and I'd really like to see it again, if not just for del Toro's performance. I hope this gives some of you guys something extra to think about if you already saw it, or a reason to go see it if you haven't! Anyway, this was way longer than I thought it'd be! I feel like im back in school writing book reports! Anyway, the movie was great! Interesting topic and story! Guns sounded awesome! Super pretty movie to look at!

Here goes.\n\nFirst thing that leaps to mind is that this is the most intense movie I have *ever* watched in the cinema. Like, *wow*. It was frickin edge-of-your-seat stuff, and the soundtrack just made it that much better. That pulsing in the background that lets you know stuff is about to go down... Good grief I loved it. Probably my favourite scene would be the bit where they're all on the road, and there's like three different cars they're picking out as suspicious. Like I said, edge-of-your-seat stuff. Intense as hell.\n\nThe shots were AMAZING. The cinematography, good lord. I felt like taking a picture every few minutes and putting it up on my wall. Loved the scene where they were prepping in the desert especially. Beautiful.\n\nThe acting was amazing as well. I don't think I've been exposed to Emily Blunt that much, I only really remember her from Edge of Tomorrow, but she was on a much higher calibre here. And Benicio del Toro was just - wow. Didn't really know about him, or take an interest in him before, but he's on my radio now, definitely.\n\nBesides all that, on the negatives, I thought the story was good-ish? It seemed rather simple. Maybe a little too simple. Surely it can't be that simple to take the head off a cartel? Or is it really? I don't really have much knowledge in the subject matter this movie dealt with, so I can't really say much about it. \n\nOh, and Michael Westen! He keeps popping up everywhere, I love it.\n\nOverall I'd say this movie was a great *experience*. It's incredibly suspenseful and really pretty (in a way). But if I were to dissect it further, think about it a little more, it's a little... It's a little flat? It's not dense and it's not an *amazing* story. It's just a fairly basic one that was shot, scored, acted and directed really well. It had atmosphere. I'm really not sure how to explain this, but it felt like an okay story elevated by everything I've mention before.  \n\nI'd put Prisoners over this, though. But this was a really, really great movie. Definitely would recommend. ", "To me, this movie combined the futility and bleakness of the first season of True Detective, with the bewilderment of Training Day. Everything about it was stunning, from the cinematography to the acting, but most especially Benicio del Toro, who channeled the persona of stone cold killer in a way I've never seen before. I ran to my car and locked it quickly after leaving the theater, expecting him to be right behind me. The best movie of the year, hands down. ", "I have a few problems with Sicario even though I really enjoyed it. I think the biggest problem has nothing to do with Denis or Deakins, and certainly not with any of the actors. It's Taylor Sheridan's screenplay. It went real big and tense for the first half, and then right after Kate fought off Ted, it really became predictable and as a result the suspense dissipated. Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors, Deakins one of my favorite DP's, and everybody involved elevated the mediocre writing to an astonishing degree. \n\nIt's a tremendous, beautifully macabre film - but after all the haunting, threatening imagery of the bodies in the wall, of the mutilated corpses hung from the bridge, it seemed to deflate the tension when the viewer realizes that the worst that's going to happen is that someone's just going to get shot. Of course, the people who *do* end up getting shot make for a very surprising (and brilliant) scene. \n\nBut yeah, you got dipped into the sprawling \"Beast\" of Juarez... And then never went back. The rest of Mexico that the audience sees is a mansion in the middle of the night. That said, I appreciate that the story's setting was \"The Border\" - it drove the point home that it didn't matter which side you were on, the corruption was everywhere.\n\nIn short, I thought the first hour was so white-knuckled, nightmarish and tense that I was expecting it to ratchet up in the same kind of setting. It's neat that the story took the risk of \"going smaller\" while still (mostly) preserving its stakes, for sure. But once Alejandro jumped into the crooked-yet-sympathetic cop's car I knew the rest of the story. It's been told before. Right down to Kate signing the paper and \"corrupting her moral code.\"\n\nAnd what became of her partner Reggie? That character's just dropped because I guess he didn't matter anyway. I can stand inconclusiveness, I appreciate lack of closure when it's done right, but I don't like feeling that things were tacked on and that the writer wasn't in control of his own story. Even Kate was too stereotypical \"overwhelmed protagonist who has no control of anything\" to me, as is so common in movies about cartels and the drug war. It felt like he set up this terrifying atmosphere, and then ditched it.\n\nSo I didn't like the writing. Everything else was fantastic.

Was he raping Guillermo? ", "Anyone else find the Jon Bernthal stuff waaaay too contrived?", "My only real criticism of the movie is that it used an FBI agent as the na\u00efve lamb character. I mean, that was a little unrealistic. I mean you kept having her say things like \"that was illegal!\" to a CIA agent about the Mexican shootout. I mean, they only do things that are technically illegal. It's the CIA, created for wetwork and espionage. We all know what they're doing all over the world.\n\nI get that she was a rookie FBI agent but she almost seemed unrealistically unaware of how the CIA does things, more na\u00efve than just some person off the street. For the CIA to NOT extrajudicially assassinate someone in another country would seem out of character, is all I'm saying.", "I enjoyed the film and might watch it again, but I was a bit disappointed as well.  I *really* wanted to be blown away, but ultimately I thought the script and plot were a bit lacking (as opposed to the cinematography and music, which was absolutely stellar).  I was hoping for a movie that had the level of political intrigue and cynicism as [*Syriana* (2005)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syriana), especially since Denis Villeneuve had said in interviews that the movie was going to be highly critical of US policies around the War on Drugs and its militarized approach toward foreign policy. \n\nOne of the biggest problems I had was that I didn't get a good understanding or connection with the by-the-books law enforcement that Kate (Emily Blunt) and Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya) want to uphold, and the lawless covert operations that Matt (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro (Benicio del Toro) are leading.  Kate and Reggie are, from the first scene, shown to be in a virtual war zone--so it was a bit confusing for me as to why Kate is *that* freaked out or upset at what she sees in Juarez.  The fact that I don't really see Kate and Reggie engage in their desired \"by-the-books\" policing means that there was a disconnect when they are getting increasingly angry and upset at their CIA/Delta Force counterparts.  I don't get a good sense of *why* they are so upset and jarred, because I was never shown what they were really expecting or what they are used to. And the final realization that the CIA was working with the Medellin Cartel kinda fell flat for me; its delivered through exposition, which is a bizarre choice considering the visual nature of the film, and its abrupt rather than shown through steady hints.  \n\nThis is also related to another big issue I had, which was the low level of consequence shown.  Typically, with these kinds of morally-gray, \"are we the baddies?\" kind of films, you see negative consequences of the protagonists' strategies start to build up; but in *Sicario*, the main \"uh oh\" movement is at the very end when the drug lords family gets killed.  Before that, what are the actual negative consequences of the covert operations?  A theoretical violation of Mexican sovereignty?  That's not very easy to connect with, or feel the ramifications of; which means that Villeneuve's stated intention of critiquing US foreign policy kinda falls flat.  It would have been great to see deeper consequences for the CIA's cynical strategy, i.e. a demonstrated corrupting of Mexican institutions, or turning a blind eye to cartel allies making off with cocaine or killing innocents, etc. \n\n**TL;DR Enjoyed the cinematography and music a whole lot, but was pretty disappointed in the plot/script, mainly because I came in expecting a lot more political intrigue and deeper engagement with larger issues of US foreign policy**  \n\n  ", "Right. I need to say this because it feels like nobody on the internet agrees, but I hated this movie. It failed for me on every level.\n\nLet's start with the plot making no sense. I get the basic theme--those who fight monsters become monsters--but their operations were incredibly half-assed. What kind of special forces send a dozen fighters on a \"diversion\" (who the hell were they diverting?) and one guy to accomplish their primary mission? I don't care how badass he is, give the man some fucking backup. Honestly, it was hard for me to figure out whether the cartels or the police were stupider, since the cartel sent their number two man across the Mexican border alone, their leader put only four guards on his house, and their hitmen at the earlier border crossing weren't even trying not to look incredibly suspicious. Also Ted, who despite knowing (I think) he was seducing one of the officers on his case, left damning evidence right out on his coffee table. Was he counting on his lovemaking prowess to ensure Kate didn't notice?\n\nThe characters were utter ciphers. Kate herself does not once have a reason to be in the movie. She's either following after the qualified people, punching the qualified people, or nearly getting killed for no good reason. Her only contribution is nearly fucking Ted, and she even needs to be rescued from that situation. Emily Blunt is a great actress in other roles, but it's like Villeneuve shot her down every time she tried to make a facial expression. She's only allowed to express herself through smoking. She has no past, no motivation except a weak nod at revenge early on, and her only milieu is a literal sassy black best friend. I'd say the character is a step backward for feminism, but she'd be equally boring as a man, so I guess that's a weird kind of equality.\n\nAnd then there's everyone else. What the hell makes Matt do what he does? How did he earn all the respect he gets? He doesn't do anything very worthy of it, except give Alejandro his stamp of approval. I didn't know Dave's name until I looked it up just now, and he disappears after getting a couple of good lines. Alejandro is better because he at least has a backstory, but del Toro was one-note. It can't be that hard to not react to anything. Then there's the parade of cartel leaders mentioned above, who I lacked the energy to care about. Seriously, filmmakers, it's not that hard to make me care that a murderous drug dealer got killed. Give me something to go on with this guy. Anything.\n\nI can't remember a second of the score. The cinematography had some good landscape shots, I guess, but I could have Googled those. But the worst part is that this movie that everyone is saying was so tense and heart-pounding just...wasn't. Ever, once. I had no reason to care about what was going on. I'm no longer surprised by people getting shot. The alleged protagonist never had any hope to actually influence the proceedings, while the real main character never faced a single obstacle.

I know this is a discussion about the movie but I think it's important contextually to know where my head was at coming in to the movie. My favorite things about the book were the characters (Watney especially) and the science. Pretty much all of the characters were likable and charming in some respect. Even foul-mouthed Annie left a warm and fuzzy impression on me. \n\nI will admit that some of the science was a little drawn out and started feeling textbooky but for the most part, it was like a series of riddles that had some ingenious solution and it's captivating to see how it was solved. What's more is that the explanations are, at once, complex but understandable. Hydrazine could be a made up thing for all I care but because of the well-crafted writing, I am able to understand the significance and context in which it is important.\n\nMy least favorite thing about the book is that Watney never really seemed to face any REAL challenge. Yes, that probably sounds crazy but bear with me: Watney is deserted on Mars with what we think is no hope of survival. Yet he always seems to have the tools and knowledge to come out unscathed (Seriously, even the gaping bloody hole from chapter 1 never gets mentioned again). Apart from one incident where he has a momentary \"tantrum,\" Watney is always optimistic and persevering. I quickly learned, while reading the book, that all the danger was an illusion. Watney never loses hope and while I think that's admirable, it made the story less gripping.\n\nThe book definitely reminded me of Michael Crichton's novels but without the danger and excitement. Imagine the movie Cast Away without the 'Wilson' scene. It's pretty hard to, right? The desperation, loneliness, and sorrow of his situation is so viscerally portrayed. It's an iconic movie moment, and I don't think The Martian has any of that. \n\nSo now I'm blending movie and book which is fine, I guess, because they are indeed VERY similar. I won't bore anyone with the tired line of \"but that wasn't in the book!\" ....\n\n....\n\nActually, I will. Because it's very much related to the last point I made.\n\nThe movie cut out a decent chunk of stuff but two scenes in particular only exacerbated the issue of Watney not facing enough challenge.\n\n[Spoiler 1](#s \"Watney breaking the communication he had with NASA while drilling holes in his Rover. I think this was important because Watney really started to feel the weight of his loneliness after this happened.\")\n\n[Spoiler 2](#s \"Uhhh....the sandstorm and FLIPPING THE ROVER. His solution to the sandstorm was genius and the rover flipping would've been quite a marvel on the screen. I'm just surprised they didn't include this.\")\n\nThe movie also downplayed a lot of the other Characters. Mindy in particular was a great character in the book with actual growth. She felt almost irrelevant in the movie. Similarly, Annie had pretty much none of her personal brand of hostility and charm. \n\nI think the movie also lost a lot of the \"Cool!\" factor by not really explaining the science behind some of Watney's decisions. Watching the movie was a bit like watching the book in that it just seemed like Watney had a cheat sheet for every possible problem he could face. The book felt better because Watney was humorously explaining the science behind some of his decisions (Like the night soil, for instance).   \n\nNow, I know the overall tone of this response is negative but I did really enjoy both the book and the movie. In my eyes, though, they both had their letdowns and I think the movie's letdowns were often greater versions of the book's. \n\nIf anyone bothered to read this whole thing, thanks! I know it's not likely to be seen but I wanted to write it anyway. \n\n[The Ending](#s \"The change to the ending was pretty dumb. I don't really mind Lewis replacing Beck but having Watney do the Iron Man thing was idiotic, in my opinion.\")\n", "I'm sad we didn't get to see (.)(.)", "If I knew how attractive people at NASA are, I would have changed my career path years ago.", "Saw this last night and thought it was utterly fantastic.

The rest of the cast do a lot of great work, even if they are underused. \nThe film works great on a visual level.\n\nI'm mainly just really pleased to see something so optimistic. I enjoy watching Mark Watney succeed, which is why I appreciated the removal of some of the false-jeopardy that was in the book. \n\nFurthermore, I think this movie is going to do some great business. Possibly *Gravity* sort of numbers.  My theatre upgraded all screenings of The Martian for this week to their largest screen, and the screening before mine was completely full.

There was no cut to Damon speaking to the audience, \"If that tarp doesn't hold, I'm dead!\" The Martian needed more of that, Damon showing instead of telling.", "Disappointed with how much they glossed over the rover engineering he did, including the power short ruining his comms, the sandstorm, the tipover, etc. If anything I think the botany accomplishments were small potatoes (GET IT?!) with how he basically made a mobile HAB and covered all the essentials (oxygen, water, power, food, storage, warmth, etc.). I know the movie couldn't cover EVERYTHING, but this was basically 5 minutes of movie. Besides that, loved the film.", "The Martian is definitely one of my favourite movies of the year (yay Ridley is back). The cinematography was amazing, and I typically don't like 3D but Mars looked really great in 3D (especially that opening shot). It was a simple story and that's why it worked so well. It relied upon the human drama instead of trying to make some grand, convoluted statement. Overall a really great movie, Damon was awesome and the entire cast is great!", "I wish the movie included the part about Johannson being the only one to survive if the Rich Parnell resupply didn't work (because she would have to eat the other members on the Hermes). That's one of those scenes in the book where it really hits home how hard space travel can be. Also it would have led to Martinez's hilarious comment about who she would have eaten first - I bet Michael Pena would have nailed that line. ", "I absolutely loved it! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and it makes me optimistic about future Mars exploration. I hope this is the world my kids will be living in. \n\nThe best part: No tacked on, needless love story. No late 20's wife with an adorable little girl waiting at home who are the only reason he needs to survive. For them. None of that shit. \n\nThere were two clich\u00e9s that stood out though.

I started busting a move in the theater.", "These are my thoughts about The Martian:\n\n* I like story in The Martian because it is fairly grounded, the narrative goal is consistent, and it was executed nicely.\n* I also like it because light-hearted movie. So most of the audiences keep engaged with the movie even though the subject is really sciency for some people.\n\n* I think Ridley Scott did a job nicely in directing The Martian and I want to give thumbs up to Drew Goddard because he adapted a good source material into a smart and hilarious screenplay.\n\n* I like Matt Damon as Watney because he is competent, funny, and witty. I think that makes his character likeable and makes people easily rooting for him throughout the movie.\n* The entire ensemble cast was also great in The Martian, from the Ares III crew to the people back at NASA and JPL. I think they do not need their big moment in this movie but there are some details, scenes, and dialogues that help you to understand the personalities of each characters.  I think that makes the character development in this movie is fairly balance.\n* I think the other actors and actresses who stands out besides Matt Damon in this movie are Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, and Jeff Daniels. I think the other actors and actresses in this movie also gave a good performance. I want to thank Ridley Scott for this. \n\n* One of the flaws in this movie is I wish that Kristen Wiig\u2019s character is more profound in this movie as a PR director of NASA but I think she did a great job in her role\n\n* The other flaw is from the visual perspectives, this movie did not offer something new but at the same time it is still pretty to look at. Especially the red dessert on Planet Mars.\n\n\nMy final words The Martian is a great movie because most of the entire ensemble cast gave a good performance from a smart and hilarious screenplay. This movie became one of my favorite movie in 2015 and my favorite theatre experience in recent years.\n\nIf I have to give the score to this move, I would give it around **8.0 \u2013 8.5 out of 10**.\n\nSide notes:\n\n* [I disagree with Mark Watney ](#s \"because Disco Music is great in space.\")\n\n* [I think it is cute ](#s \"that Winter Soldier and Invisible Woman (Beck and Johanssen) have a baby together at the end of the movie.\")", "The ending though, Lewis stealing Beck's big moment!

When the pod supply mission explodes during take-off the incident takes place at 1m 13s into launch.

Anyway, I would recommend the movie, but I'd recommend the book 2x as hard.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people talking about the movie capturing the novel. I really don't think it did. I never felt like once that Mars was trying to kill Watney during the movie. The movie almost seemed to be more about the people on Earth and the Hermes rescuing him than him rescuing himself. In the book he is always fighting to survive and while you know he is going to you are still invested.

I didn't read the book and I'm not particularly into science. I'm very interested in space topics, though, so I thought I'd at least enjoy it. Sadly, I really did not. \n\nFor a movie about such a truly horrific and desolate situation, I was shocked that its tone was highly upbeat for 90% of the movie.\n\nI found it lacking in tension, emotion, and character development. I thought it was much longer than it needed to be. There were times I was really truly bored. When the last montage came on, I felt myself drift off. There were so many montages. \n\nThe stakes for Mark's survival were never very high. He didn't appear to have much of a family at home that he missed, everything seemed to go very well for him in general. He always had a perfect solution for everything, he was basically super human. The isolation of his situation almost never showed in his character. He got a bit huffy once when something broke and he was a bit emotional when he was finally being rescued, but he showed no signs of insanity, or really, struggle. He had no development and no attachments. \n\nThe sense of humor throughout felt cheesy to me. I cringed a lot. The jokes were like a what a 35 year old science professor picked up from a few months on the Internet. The use of curse words as humor is only funny if you're very young. I can't believe I'm seeing praise for that. \n\nI thought the supporting characters were soulless. When asked if they would spend another bunch of years in space to return for Mark, not a SINGLE one objected? Everything in this universe existed for Mark and no one else. He was the universe's priority  \n\nDonald Glover's character was bizzare, he existed for cheap, immature laughs. \n\nOne thing I will say is, it built a bit of tension when they were finally executing the rescue, but ultimately those scenes left me missing Interstellar and Gravity.\n\nOverall, I really don't get the hype. This movie was boring, often cringe-worthy and lacked tension. The protagonist was cocky, didn't have many emotional attachments to earth and was smarter than everyone.

But why doesn't a movie have to be intelligent and soulful to be considered great anymore?  There are reviews out there calling this film smart and designating it for intelligent audiences.  Give me a break.  The effects are pretty breath-taking but aside from that it's hardly memorable.  The whole time you're aware of something missing.  It's typical Ridley Scott:\n\nbeautiful score\n\nstunning visuals\n\nutter crap writing/corny dialogue\n\nno heart \n\nAt not one point did I care in the slightest about the well-being of Damon's character.

I mean there was no talk of how important he was to the world like the team were in Danny Boyle's Sunshine.\n\nThis thread seems to have no negative comments about it which I also find quite weird, this is reddit FFS, so I guess the fans were ready to start commenting on it as soon as they seen it. ", "The Martian was fine. It had some great moments and some really dumb ones. And everyone keeps praising the direction and the adaptation, but I think those are my biggest complaints. The pacing was really bad, especially in the beginning, to the point where a lot of the tension was lost in what were supposed to be very tense scenes. Even the big scene where he gets left behind felt very anticlimactic, partially because of this and partially because the other characters didn't act regretful enough afterward. A lot of scenes suffered like this; the crew finding out he was alive, the supply rendezvous above earth, the crew deciding they're going to rescue Watney, etc. The whole movie just felt rushed, even though it was 2.5 hours long. \n\nSome of the things I didn't like:\n\n* \"I need a map!\" So he goes to the cafe and pulls a picture of mars off the wall. You really don't have a map of mars? At NASA? In the middle of a mars mission?\n* \"And that's if nothing goes wrong.\" <Jeff Daniels basically winks at the camera>\n* I'm fairly sure you can't use human feces as fertilizer because of the protein in it. The reason we use cow's is because they're herbivores. I could be wrong. \n\n* Donald Glover played his character so over the top that it just felt like a cartoon character wandered into the set from a different movie\n\n* Johanssen and Beck's relationship kinda came out of nowhere. Even if that happened in the book it was poorly realized on film and came across as a shoehorned romance subplot\n\nI guess most of these complaints are minor, but I was disappointed by the movie. Don't get me wrong, I liked it. It had some great and hilarious moments, and it was just really pretty in general, but it's far from the perfect film everyone in this thread is making it out to be.

I'm glad to have saw it and will probably pick it up on blu when it hits.", "The biggest problem with it, I felt, was the pacing and the constant switching between NASA and Mars scenes. It's not so much a problem with directing as more a problem of the inevitable nature of movies; the switching really makes the viewer, at least for me, lose the sense of isolation Watney experiences. You stick with him for a few minutes see him do stuff, then back to Earth and then when the scene returns to Watney it's back to square one in building that isolation again. I kept thinking how they could have given that Cast Away feel but the NASA scenes are crucial, so it's a bit of a catch-22 in the end in not making it too boring but making it just engaging enough within the time constraints of a movie.", "Well I guess I'm going to fire up the engines on the downvote express, because I think reading and loving the book ruined my enjoyment of this film. \n\nIt's exactly what I feared when I heard Matt Damon had been cast as Watney.  He's an action star now, and they completely changed it to fit him. They somehow managed to change a comedy into a drama, while completely taking out all emotion. It's impressive, actually. \n\nThey de-German'd the German. They turned an Indian man black. But hey, fuck it, diversity is diversity, who gives a shit, right?  Oh and let's throw in a healthy dash of make the female captain the end hero while also stripping out any of the parts that made that scene heroic. \n\nSpeed up to the point of why not jut put it in fast forward, de-science'd, stripped of almost all humor.

For some reason, it felt like the ugly and boring brother of *Gravity*. The premise/plot had similarities with *Gravity*, which I found amazing in its simplicity. *The Martian* just seemed to drag on without investing much into what the character is feeling in his solitude and awareness that he is close to death, and if it did, it wasn't effective at all. \n\nI also can't stand the cliches, like the rogue NASA employee that ignores the rules to upstand his personal morals, the nerdy socially awkward scientist that comes up with the scientific solution, the trademark locations like times square and trafalgar square with their human crowds trying to convey a failed attempt of emotional attachment to the hero by the human race.

The Watney storyline's original format would have been closer to a found footage film, but the problem there is that the appeal there is fairly limited. His character doesn't change all on Mars, so it's literally just watching this mary sue-ish character solve every problem he's presented with and the way that is approached is through science that goes over the head of 98% of the audience which leads goofy pirate ninja bits where the audience just tunes him out until he goes back to talking about something interesting. Pretty much masturbatory material for engineers who like to fix everything on their car with duck tape. So obviously, that approach is out. Too limited of appeal, too flat a story, etc.\n\nSo what it looks like they tried to turn it into a vaguely more Hollywood story, and managed to avoid hitting any of the really interesting aspects of either world. They leave out 99% of the science (because the audience won't give a shit) but you're left with a boring mary sue quasi-nerd trying to survive in a story where it would be completely out of tone for him to just die alone on the planet. We're not exploring the emotions of someone surviving alone on Mars, we're just watching a dude solve problems. So ultimately you know he's going to make it and the story doesn't even have the balls to kill anyone to actually make space a legitimate threat. It's just not that kind of story.\n\nThey even forget they took out the science, which leads to scenarios where they don't explain how he farms potatoes on Mars, but when the Hab blows, they mumble the book's reasoning why he couldn't farm anymore. It's like delivering the punchline of a joke when you forgot to say the set up for the joke.\n\nI'm on the fence as to whether or not it was worth going. I didn't get into the book from the perspective needed to fully enjoy it, and the movie (IMO) doesn't have any perspective to really enjoy it. Flat character, simple plot, and I saw it in 2D so I can't say whether or not the 3D visuals made it worth it like Avatar. The handful of tracking shots in 2D weren't that amazing and I was wondering if it was just a recolored real location or entirely CGI during most.

The film constantly moves back and forth between Mars and Earth. I felt like it took the drama away from Mark being on Mars and focused it more on NASA trying to find a way to get him home. I was unable to feel tension in many scenes because the audience usually knew if something would fail/succeed. There were many parts of the movie that you could tell there was a larger backstory (book) because some characters had specks of development that seemed out of place.

Instead of the passionate activist she'd originally been drawn to, he revealed himself to be just another cynic with ulterior motives. And by the time they were in the cage, he got even worse. But still, she didn't want to be prosecuted for murder, so she lied about her role in his (presumed) death.  \nb) The tribe were cannibals and most of them seemed devoid of compassion, but they also mistook the activists for the same people who were threatening to tear down their home and kill them. That's what she went there to stop, so in that sense she is very much on their side. The kid who freed her reminded her that they are still human beings, not irredeemable savages. She knew the tribe would be wiped off the face of the earth if she came back to the first world and told everyone what they did, and she still wanted to save them, even if only for that one kid and possibly others like him.  \nc) I wonder if maybe Justine really caught the activist bug there at the end - she held up the camera on the phone and seemed to enter a \"THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING THIS!\" mode, the kind of radical thinking that led her to going on the trip in the first place, even though she was obviously uncomfortable and out of place. Concocting this story and playing the part of white savior may have been a big plus for her.\n\nThe movie was silly, but the fact that I'm still thinking about her choice at the end means it was at least somewhat successful.", "\"They've got the munchies!\" I lost my shit that was so funny.

You can tell Roth had great ideas for deaths and scares, but really didn't know how to get there. A lot of the scenes felt like filler, especially when Justine falls in to the river. Also, because of Roth's diehard passion for horror and traditional gore, I was surprised at the amount of cheap CGI. Having flesh eating natives is frightening enough, I really didn't see why computer animated leopards and ants were necessary. The third act was really messy and rushed, but I did still enjoy the outcome of Justine trying to persuade that the natives were good people.

That part where she is about to get circumcised made me want to avert my eyes and made my stomach turn. \n\nThe rest of the movie is actually rather tame. The CG ants were so bad looking, the weed and poop jokes were so awkward, even seeing a guys eyes gouged out and limbs cut off was...meh. Maybe it's just me, but it's like, they're cannibals, this is what they do. So while the rest of the movie fell very flat, I gotta give Eli Roth credit for really getting under my skin with the whole female circumcision thing. \n\nIs the movie good?

Krakauer gives such a thorough look at the expedition and how it all went wrong, the interactions with the different expeditions, the defiance on the mountain and the difficulties getting everyone to work together, guides, clients and leaders. Everest hints at all these interactions, but provides no depth or perspective. Good that they did at least. One thing I thought Kormakur got really wrong was the pacing of the experience, hours would go by in seconds, it made it really hard to understand the trauma they were going through.\n\nI thought the character development for the most part was good, I didn't need more backstory or understanding - maybe a bit more in the right places - less jan, peach, beck, more anatoli, and other guides. The one place Everest was lacking badly was on Scott and his perspective. Very unfortunate he was seriously glossed over (maybe Jake got mountain madness and his scenes were cut). It looked like Scott was reckless and that's what cost him his life, but really he was stressed beyond belief running up and down that mountain trying to take care of everything. \n\nI also thought I had a poor idea of how the mountain was laid out, the major landmarks, Camp1, C2, C3, C4?. Can't remember exactly how many there are. South Col, Hillary Steps. You need to develop a clear picture to grasp the journey they took. By the end of ITA I could see the mountain and all the places and picture clearly where everyone was during their trek and where they died. \n\nI agree though - no villains because there weren't any - good on Kormakur.\n\nBut if you did enjoy Everest, make sure you read the book Into Thin Air.

Jason Clarke did a really solid job as the lead.\n\nI liked that the film didn't linger too much on the deaths, it made it seem more tasteful, though there was an unintentionally funny moment when [spoilers] (#s \"John Hawkes' character died. The shot set-up was weird and it was kinda funny how he fell when Clarke's back was turned\"). Most people just die and there's not a big sentimental song and dance nor a focus on grisly injuries. To me this made the film much more about the man vs. nature aspect.\n\nAlso the film did a good job making it \"unpredictable\". Yeah it's kinda tacky to talk about a mystery aspect when it's a real-life story, but I honestly had no idea who would live or die which suits the theme of the film; no matter how prepared you are, nature decides in the end.\n\nI was surprised at how quickly they climbed the summit, though. I thought that was gonna take waaaay longer after they climbed the step, so I was a bit like \"WTF\" when they all started celebrating. But obviously it's real life and the shit truly hit the fan on the way down.\n\nYet another movie this year that I am genuinely surprised I enjoyed more than either Jurassic World or Ant-Man. It's pretty much as good as Avengers: AoU too.\n\nDon't see it in 3D though. A lot of the film is talky and I'd say about 80% of the time it's invisible. \n\nEDIT: Also, how the fuck did this only cost $55 million? With the visuals and actors I wouldn't have been surprised to see it in the $80-100 million range.", "I watched this a few weeks ago in IMAX 3D. I don't recall the 3D adding a lot, but the IMAX sure did. It kind of makes sense for them to release it this way a week early, because honestly it is the only way you should watch the film.\n\nI went in for Gyllenhaal, but was presently surprised by the rest of the cast, especially when Jake wasn't in it as much as I had expected. \n\nThe second phone call between Rob and his wife had me balling my eyes out. Just straight up tears rolling down my badly bearded cheeks. I am so glad that the scene is basically real and how terrible that conversation must have been for both of them in real life. I can only hope that when I go out in a tragic storm that I can at least have a goodbye call with my own wife.\n\nAnd yeah. Beginning had its issues in terms of interest, but the last 45 minutes or and hour were just edge of my seat intensity. I am glad no one was a super bad guy. Some people were dick-ish. But even I was rooting for the Texan despite his ego. \n\nAnatoli Boukreev is GOAT and BAMF.\n\nYou can read my [full shitty review here](http://gorgview.com/everest). :)", "I really enjoyed this movie! I did not know anything about the Everest Disaster, but I thought the movie was entertaining, suspenseful, and beautifully shot. You don't really get to know many of the characters in the movie aside from Clarke, but I don't think it's necessary. You're given enough of a backstory to be interested but you never get truly attached. I didn't find it a problem as the Mountain seems to be the actual star of the movie. Film was gorgeous. I loved the shots of mountains and glaciers. \n\nSome of the bits were confusing between the accents and the radio/wind/sounds but overall I could follow along and it didn't really hinder my enjoyment. It's a movie I'll probably be picking up once it's released on Blu-Ray. ", "So this is one of the few times I've ever actually made noise at a theater. People in mine were cheering on Beck to get back up.", "I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that for once, I didn't recognise Keira Knightly (though there were only 3 female parts in the film). Kudos to her for her Kiwi accent.\n\nJason Clarke was outstanding and a real credit to the casting director since he as well, actually looks a lot like the real Rob Hall.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal was a bit of a caricature and totally underused - I agree with whoever said that his weeks of being short-staffed and running up and down that mountain, contributing to his underconditioning, was not touched upon.\n\nThe good: Everest - IMAX and in 3D - especially the early establishing shots of the valleys were just breathtaking and worth the price of the ticket alone imho.\n\nThe acting was overall very good though it was very hard to make out which bearded hooded figure was who on the mountain (as it would be in real life, I guess). You also really got a sense of how arbitrary existence can be up at that altitude - some of the deaths were totally shocking.\n\nThe bad: Gyllenhaal - Scott Fisher may have been a surfin' laid back dude in real life, but I don't think that the film did him much justice as he ended up being portrayed as an irresponsible louche, for want of a better word. \n\nThe ugly: The storm .. the viewers we as lost as the climbers, trying to work out where/what the south summit, south col, Camps 1/II/III/IV actually WERE.. not sure how this could have been presented outside of a documentary. I can't remember if they used any sort of time stamp/title but I think it may have been helpful to show the timing of the events (including the summit push).\n\nFinally, had I not read \"Into Thin Air\", I would've assumed that Beck's story and Hall's final speech were cliched Hollywood hokum but there you go - real life does from time to time, outshine even Hollywood scriptwriters for dramatic miraculous moments. \n\nI have been fascinated by the high peaks for quite some time (and loved Russell Brice's telly show) so I knew that i would love this so am going back again to be back on the mountain with the team of '96 once again. ", "I saw a few people complain momentarily about this, but I was actually pleasantly surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal reduced to such a secondary role, despite being given top billing along with Jason Clarke. This isn't to say I don't like him, I think he's a great actor. I just also really like Jason Clarke as of the last few years and it's cool to see him given star billing alongside one of the biggest stars on the planet. This was Clarke's vehicle to drive and he drove the cast well. In addition to Zero Dark Thirty and Apes, he's got an exciting career ahead of him that really has only just taken off.", "I went into this movie because The Scorch Trials showing was full, and I'm really glad it was, because I really enjoyed the performances and set pieces. I had never heard about the 1996 incident prior to this movie, so I was actually waiting to see who would make it and who wouldn't. That being said, I was expecting to see Rob being saved, so it really bummed me out when I learned that Rob, Scott and the japanese woman died. Overall, it is great how the movie captured the realism of its events and the feeling of hopelessness of being in that stuation. ", "As much as I enjoy the majority of the actors, the movie lost a lot of its touch by not having any sort of proper character development. The setpieces were amazing and the performances were fine, but it was tough to get attached to any character. Made the movie lose a lot of emotional weight. ", "Just saw it, and I loved it. My only gripe is that I wish it were longer.\n\nThe movie definitely hit all of the necessary plot points, but I would have liked to have seen more about the sherpas, Makalu Gau, and the Indo-Tibetan Expedition.  Overall, it was one of my favorite movies of the year.

I wished that had developed the people more. They made some of \"tourists\" seem like the were incompetent even though most had a lot of previous experience climbing mountains. They set up John Krakauer as a journalist for Outside magazine but fail to mention the multiple mountains he had summited.\n\n\nThere was a major historical error with Beck Weathers played by Josh Brolin. He was wearing a Dole Kemp 1996 t-shirt to show the year, but they climbed they mountain on May 10th and had to be in 4th base camp for 3 weeks before. Adding travel and time at base camp Beck left Texas sometime in early April. Bob Dole hadn't won the nomination yet nor had he choose his running mate. Kemp wasn't chosen til July of 1996. Months after the climb.", "I just got out of this not an hour ago and it was alright. All the acting was great the visuals were breath taking. It was just too long, or at least felt too long. But my biggest problem was when the shit went down I had no clue what was happening to who. I mean I understand that if there is a massive blizzard you're not gonna know what your buddy is doing and stuff but as an audience member I felt that I was a little out of the loop. For example I didn't know what was going on with Jake Gyllenhaals character for a solid 10 minutes even then I wasn't really sure. This movie though not bad was a let down because I got myself pretty hyped so I'd give it a C or 5/10 just average.

That was about as tense of a scene as I can remember watching in years.", "Why the hell is a gangster movie with an all star cast about Whitey Bulger only 2 hours long?", "I wanted to like it way more than I ended up liking it and I can't explain why. I feel like it had all the right pieces of a really, really nice film, but it was just put together wrong.  \n\nThe pacing was awkward. For a film that's only barely two hours, it felt like an eternity, and not in a good way. Slow scene after slow scene muddled the distinction between the parts that really mattered, and there seemed to be no plot almost. Minor plot points that were either dropped, resolved quietly (and insignificantly) or whatever else.  \n\nI think Cooper tried to tell as much factual story as possible and the film suffered for it. Real life events told in true chronological order make good news, but not good stories always. They could have built the whole thing around the takedown of the italian mafia, which the entire first act is based on and is resolved by the middle of the movie and doesn't really affect anything else for the remainder. Bummed me out.  \n\nI don't need to comment on the performances as everyone else is accurately saying how amazing they are. I just wish the film was built better. ", "Depp was literally terrifying. The presence he imposed on the characters and on the viewer was just powerful and powerfully unnerving at that. Very good, solid movie but Depp really did a fantastic job.

I wasn't necessarily disappointed, it was still a great movie, but it wasn't fantastic, and I was expecting fantastic. \n\nNow... as what will be said from now and for some, nothing more can be said about Johnny Depp's performance.\n\nHoly shit.  \n\nHe is scary. He doesn't look like Johnny Depp, he doesn't sound or walk or sit like Johnny Depp. This guy on screen is simply someone I had the pleasure of never meeting because goddamn he is a scary motherfucker if I've ever seen one in s movie. And watching him go from having a soul to being just a sort of pit of darkness -coughcough roll credits- was really amazing. His character was hands down the best part of movie. \n\nTL;DR Family recipes ain't nothin to fuck with. ", "Where to begin...\n\n7.5/10 I think is an accurate score for the movie. Definitely worth seeing though. Black Mass was a good movie that should have been a great one.\n\nFirst of all, Johnny Depp did absolutely amazing in the movie. If the movie was a little better I think he could easily have grabbed an Oscar for the performance. Some people will disagree, but honestly the movie was way too short. The movie was only 2 hours and 2 minutes long. There is a reason a lot of popular gangster movies are are all nearly 2.5-3 hours long (Godfather, Goodfellas, American Gangster etc.).\n\nThe biggest problem with the movie was that almost none of the other characters were developed well. Billy, Jimmy's brother, was hardly even in the movie. Which was very strange since he was played by Benedict Cumberbatch. If you were going to bother casting him with Benedict I would expect way more scenes. His accent was actually well done in the movie though you could hear the \"British\" in his voice during certain sentences. Overall, none of the characters got any true development except John Connolly. Kevin, Johnny, and Stevie all should have had way more scenes especially since Kevin and Stevie were confessing to everything. The way the movie started I thought the entire movie was going to be from Kevin's perspective and narrated but they kind of just stopped. Adding extra scenes about him and the others to develop their character alone would probably bring the movie around the 2.5 hour mark, and it would also have you care about the characters more instead of as \"Random Henchman #1\".\n\nAnother problem was the pacing and overall flow of the movie. I did not like the pacing of the movie at all. It was incredibly jumpy for the first hour. It improved near the ending scenes, but even then the movie was extremely all over the place. There isn't really a 'main plot' to the movie. The movie is essentially *Whitey does this, Whitey does that, Whitey killed the girl, Whitey has dinner here, Whitey kills this guy*. There is no real main plot to the story. You never really build to anything throughout the entire movie, its just things that Whitey does over and over. You never even see how Whitey became as powerful as he was, it was automatically assumed in the movie he was a kingpin.\n\nThis last problem was more personal opinion, but I felt the movie needed a stronger soundtrack. There is hardly any music in the film aside from the serious scenes. The ending scene had a great track, I don't understand why the entire movie didn't have effort into it.\n\nIt may sound like I didn't like the movie, but it was definitely  enjoyable. You should certainly go see it this weekend along with other 4 big releases.\n\n", "I wanted more Adam Scott", "So why is *Black Mass* called \"Black Mass\"? Does it have anything to do with anything that happens in the movie, or is it just a cool name?", "As someone from Massachusetts I want to thank them for finally making a movie set in Boston that doesn't give every character an annoying over the top fake accent. \n\nOverall, very solid movie. Performances were excellent all around and it kept me engrossed the entire time. It didn't have much of an ending but that's a result of really sticking to the actual events.\n\nAlso, how many times has Kevin Bacon played a cop?", "While I was bored for a lot of it and the direction itself was pretty forgettable, I *did* really like the shot of Bulger overlooking his mother's funeral.  The lighting was perfect and Depp looked positively demonic in that scene.  It really echoed the visual style of *The Godfather*.  That was probably my favorite part.   ", "I really didn't like this movie. But I think my opinion might be a bit skewed, because I've been watching Narcos (for the second time). Narcos just does everything Black Mass does, but so much better. \n\nOverall I rate it at best a 6/10. Not very memorable. Depp was awesome though.", "My issues with this movie come down to the writing and directing. I feel like Edgerton's character should have been the focus, with Bulger coming in to steal the show in a supporting role. He really had no arc, as opposed to Connelly. \n\nAdditionally, the slow pace did not work at all. There really wasn't anything at all to chew on, which is vital if you're going to have this type of pacing. \n\nThis movie also suffered from \"character vanishment syndrome\", which means either it was cut down significantly in editing or the writers were sloppy. \n\nOverall I'd give this a 7/10. Solid kick off to the Fall movie season. ", "I can't wait for that movie about the french guy walking across the Twin Towers to come out so that we can STOP SEEING THE FUCKING TRAILER ATTACHED TO EVERY MOVIE THAT COMES OUT.", "Let me first start by saying that I enjoyed it a lot. Depp was killer and so was Edgerton. That being said I feel like they left a lot of things out that would've also made for good scenes that would have fit the movie and shown Whitey's power and how the \"alliance\" truly was shifted in Whitey's favor. (I read the book.) Some of the characters were skewed and not so much true to the book (but favored to move the movie along so I forgive it). For example, I dont know why they portrayed Stevie \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi as such a downtrodden character. He was Whitey's number 2 and had a reputation as a killer. (Also he's the one that suggests killing his step-daughter, dont know why they made it seem like he didnt want to.) This next one is just a little gripe but Kevin Weeks doesnt really come into play till the 80s but thats beside the point. John Morris' character was waaaaaaaaaay more into it than they showed in the movie. He took money and gifts from Bulger and held dinners at his house as well. I feel like they could've made more of a statement with how both the Johns pumped up the info that Whitey gave them (or didn't give them). Or how they helped thwart several investigations into the Winter Hill Gang. Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan plays a bigger role in the book, actually plays quite a big role but for some reason is only in the movie for that offhand scene; for pacing reasons no doubt (the director has said that the original runtime was closer to 3 hours, so here's to hoping for a directors cut!). They left out Whitey's girlfriend, Catherine Greig, but from what I understand Sienna Miller's scenes were cut. \n\nAll in all I liked it a lot and understand some of the reasons they made the choices they did but feel as though they couldve fleshed out the book in maybe a miniseries or something to that effect. I will be buying the BluRay tho, thats for sure.  Johnny Depp was chilling and several scenes were suuuuper uncomfortable.. in a good way. Many times Depp was unsettling with his stare and mannerisms. Overall, the acting and directing and script was great.\n\nedit: a word", "I felt like it could have been a better movie if it was longer or if it focused on a particular period of bulgers life. Wolf of Wallstreet had a similar timeframe and it never felt jumpy or shallow. All character were just glimpses in this movie that had no real essence to them. Depps acting was great but not enough to save it in my opinion. I wish he had more interactions and chemistry with his brother. Good acting, mediocre direction 6.5/10", "I loved the performances and the make up. Both were top notch. \n\nOn the other hand, the direction felt a little paint-by-numbers to me. Very little was done with the camera that I would consider interesting. ", "Saw it as part of a free preview yesterday.  Amazing performances by Johnny Depp and Joel Edgerton.  Anyone else get chills when Depp gunned down Peter Sarsgaard's character with a rifle in broad daylight? ", "I've been trying to put my finger on why the movie wasn't a home run for me, despite Depp's stellar performance. \n\nAside from some weird tone switching early on in the movie, I think what is really lacking is that we don't get much insight into the character of Whitey himself. I came away with a much better understanding of Connolly's nuances and motivations than I did Bulger. \n\nDepp's Bulger was a terrifying killing machine, but there was no gray areas \u2013\u00a0he was simply insane. We didn't get a glimpse into anything under the surface with the character, and we knew so little about his business and how he got there \u2013\u00a0in fact, we're just told literally in narration, \"Jimmy went from a small time hood to a kingpin.\" \n\nIf the movie just had a little more room to breathe, instead of wrapping up in a quick 120 minutes, we could have gotten more of that background and I think it would have been a better movie for it. ", "Seems like I'm early..\n\nJust saw this and quite liked it. I didn't really buy Cumberbatch's accent. Depp, however, was in top form. ", "Having read and watched everything about the man over the years, I'm torn.\n\nOn one hand I love the casting, the performances are great. The costumes, sets, everything looked perfect.\n\nAt the end of the day though, a story like this cannot and should not be condensed to 2 hours. It just doesn't do this story justice. \n\nHowever if I didn't know the intricate details, I would have loves it. As a film it's great, and I love how this portrays the gangsters as twisted psychopaths over the usual flashly rags to riches stories.\n\nLoved the end credits btw", "Narratively flat film with no rising action, climax, or falling action - just a collection of scenes around a dinner table/bar with *amazing performances* by the actors.", "So I'll be honest...I thought it was just okay. The movie was well made and very well acted, but it definitely began to drag towards the end and overall I'm not exactly sure what the film was trying to say.\n\nIt was clearly about Edgerton and how he became heavily involved with The White Hill Gang, but I don't know it just felt so by the books and didn't take any chances. The film felt like it couldn't wait to get to the next murder, the next hit. Every other scene felt like Depp needed to take care of someone else and after a while it got pretty repetitive. \n\nI personally think we should have stuck with Jesse Plemons character throughout, have all of this happen around him while he is out of the loop with exactly what is going on. His introduction during the first half of the film was solid as hell then he kinda fell to the waist side. There were main characters but no one \"Main Character\" and I think that's what really hurt the movie. \n\nOverall it wasn't a bad movie it just could have been so much more. Would give the film a B if I had to put a grave to it.", "It bothered me how they showed about his kid in the hospital. Tried to make that intense scene where Dakota Johnson said she wanted to pull the plug(which was bad acting on her part). Then not show anything about his death. All they did was say he died first then whiteys mom after. Felt like there should have been more there but that's just my opinion. \n\nOther than that I liked the movie. I give it a A-", "It was good but not great. While the idea of paralleling Connoley's fall to crime with Bulger's rise to power was interesting at first, it tread water quickly and didn't go anywhere surprising. Also felt like the film wanted to be Goodfellas and Donnie Brasco, a big sweeping biopic and an intimate character study. The problem is so many great actors come and give great performances only to be shuffled away quickly. The whole thing felt muddled by the end.\n\nWhat is great is the acting. Most of the acclaim is going to go Johnny Depp and with good reason. He's otherworldly but in a good way. He's almost this insane primal force of nature that doesn't fit in the human world. Some won't like it but it really worked for me and he could hold suspense so well. However I really hope some attention is paid to Joel Edgerton because I think he knocked it out of the park. He really did a great job and I hope he gets some awards attention. Also thought Rory Cochrane did quite well, especially in that very well done scene where has to watch his step-daughter killed in front of him. That little pat he did on her dead body killed me. Also while she wasn't in it very long, it's nice to see Dakota Johnson in a non 50 Shades role. She's a promising actress and hope she gets a really good role soon.\n\nOverall this fits alongside the other Scott Cooper films. With him it's clear; don't come for the story, come for the acting.", "This movie was a complete snoozefest. They had no idea who's perspective to tell the story from, or even how to tell it.

I understand the guy had blue eyes, but they were so distracting it took me out of it the entire time.

It definitely had its ups and downs.\n\nSome thoughts (from someone who hasn't read the books):\n\n* Giancarlo Esposito fucking killed it. I loved his character, though at points, I just expected him to start asking \"What do we say to the god of death?\" Maybe it's cause Littlefinger and Missandei were hanging around, but Jorge felt a little Syrio-esque.\n\n* I still have no fucking clue what exactly this virus is, or why the fuck these kids were in mazes. Why don't just straight up harvest them? What?\n\n* Wasn't Thomas supposed to have regained his memory in the last movie? Why does it feel like he never did.\n\n* I get why people hate shaky cam. This movie made me despise it. The action is nauseating and incomprehensible at points. That first zombie (cranks? are they called cranks?) chase scene was just a blur. It looked like it could have had potential, but noooo.\n\n* Speaking of which, there were so many times these kids were in danger, and then suddenly, they weren't in danger in the next shot. Like they built up a bunch of suspense, and then BOOM safe.\n\n* Big offender here: That scene were brenda is stuck on the window, and it's breaking under her. Every little movement is dangerous. And then the Crankzombie fucking lands on it from 20 feet, and suddenly, it's super stable and they can fight around it. Thomas had to struggle to break the thing. AND HOW DID THEY GET DOWN?\n\n* I like that Theresa was a traitor. Because she did nothing until she betrayed them. Like, I could tell she was gonna betray them every since she pulled Thomas aside to talk to him, and then NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO FINISH HER VERY INTERESTING SENTENCE EVEN AFTER WINSTON KILLED HIMSELF. Seriously, Thomas, I spent the entire movie wondering why she wanted to go back, it seemed really fucked up, maybe you should have asked her before she mutinied. Anyways, I'm really glad she was a traitor because at least she fucking did something. Her character just felt offensive, like the author of the book was just like \"we should have a hot girl here who everyone likes and doesn't do anything.\" And it disappointed me, because I like her and I want her to do things, so even if she ended up being a Judas, at least it was something. And she still seems like she has a heart. (But seriously, Brenda was an interesting character from the moment she stepped on the screen...and Theresa....wasn't...)\n\n* I think my favorite part of the movie was the final battle. That was actually kind of cool.\n\n\nI don't know. I had other thoughts. These are really rambling, but I wanted to write them down. It was a fun time at the movies, really everything I expected. I still haven't had to pay for a movie in this series, but I suppose I'll try to see the next movie. I'm just so weirdly interested by this movie. AND I GOTTA SEE THEM SAVE MINHO. Oh, and for Theresa to redeem herself. Like I said, I like her for some reason even though she's a nothing character.", "Two questions around Winston.

I mean, not that I think it's a better movie than say, Fury Road or Inside Out, but to me, it was fun and exhilarating, which is really all I ever look for. \n\nI thought the action scenes were really, really well done, and got super tense. The acting was great all around, and speaking of acting - Alan Tudyk?! Wth he popped out of nowhere! Was he supposed to be a secret cameo or something? I had no idea he was going to be in this, it was an awesome surprise.\n\nOne other thing I appreciated: The movie didn't leave me hanging as much as I was expecting it to. I was so expecting the movie to end with all of them going back to WICKED, which would have sucked, but it carried on with that last battle. \n\nOn the downside, I thought the main character was a bit devoid of personality. He's understandably in pressure and stuff, I get that, but still, maybe just one small moment to show what he's really like, when he's not fighting off zombies? They seem to be building up a love triangle, which is always meh for me, but they didn't focus on it that much at all, which is great. \n\nOh, and the zombies, did that remind anyone else of the Last of Us? That whole scene where they were in the city, to the mall, to the sewers, I was getting serious Last of Us vibes. Plus, the cranks acted SO much like Clickers! They even kept making the click clicking noise thing, especially the ones in the sewers.\n\nBut yeah, TL;DR? I liked the movie very much. Cranks are Clickers.

Good writing, excellent cinematography, superb actors, and damn good set design.\n\nThe first movie didn't hold a candlelight to the second, in my opinion.", "I've really enjoyed the series so far. In these kind of movies you're waiting for the love triangle but there doesn't seem to be one so far which I'm glad about.\n\nI'm looking forward to the third one. (Defend the fortress!) I hope Teresa is much more involved in the next one. I loved her introduction in the first as there was a tonal shift once she arrived.\n\nFor a budget of $61m I was incredibly impressed. I've seen movies with double/triple that budget and they look awful. Wes Ball the director clearly has his CGI connections locked down.\n\n8/10 I much prefer this series over The Hunger Games.", "I'm going to be completely honest - I hated this movie, and its not even because the plot is entirely different. It is one thing to change the plot to make the story more exiting on the big screen, or even if you just think you can make the story better. But if you're going to change pretty much the entire plot line, at least be smart about it.  The movie was so focused on the action that it completely ignored common sense, and left some pretty weird plot holes, such as: \n-Why the hell would a guard have access to a very important lab?\n-Lets run away from WCKD and hide in the first building we see that's probably less than a mile from where the WCKD building is. They wont look for us there.\n-Also, whilst in this building, lets turn on their power supply when we were told (and were chased by) crazy people with a zombie like virus.\n-Winstons stomach was pretty much entirely ripped open. Once they free him, he's ignored until he falls over dying. \n-When running from the full-time cranks, during the suspenseful glass scene, the glass was cracking under Brenda's weight, but could hold with her weight plus the force of the crank slamming and flailing on it. Because...physics?\n-When the group was attacked by the \"ambush\" (Right Arm), they were surrounded on all sides, yet were able to hide behind a car.\n\nAlso, was I the only one that noticed that they could run through a corridor and end up in a GIGANTIC metropolis that was never there in earlier scenes?\n\nI'm also not even sure what the point of this movie was. It could be summed up just like this: Gladers escape from WCKD, Teresa wants to go back, Minho gets captured, so Thomas decides to go back to WCKD. What the **** was the point of this movie. The ONLY important thing we found out was that WCKD was harvesting enzymes from the immune in a way that's considered immoral. Where is the plot development? Where is the depth?\n\nHonestly, I don't mind so much if the plot changes. But this movie was so poorly thought out and its sad to see it share the same name as the book. I sure hope i'm not alone here.", "I preferred the plot of the book.  I understand to a degree why they changed things, but I think the book plot would have done just fine as a movie.", "I deeply apologize. This is my first reddit post and I'm honored to have it on this discussion. Furthermore, I deeply apologize that I have not read any of the Maze Runner franchise novels. I just finished watching The Scorch Trials and I have a few questions:\n\n1. Why does WCKD not just kill Thomas if he was the one that leaked all of WCKD's inner workings? Why did they throw Thomas into the Maze Trials? Did they not expect him to escape?\n2. Why even have the Maze Trials for the kids who have the immunity to the Flare if they just need the kids with immunity for harvesting? \n\nI would deeply appreciate any answers from avid fans.

At the end of the first one, Ava indicates that the kids passed the first test and now it's on to the next-- so does this mean they were intended to escape from the WCKD compound? and outside was the test?  \n  \nAnd the maze itself was meant to serve as an experiment to learn how their brains worked-- but it seemed throughout this movie that it's pretty clear they knew how it all worked. What did they learn from the maze? Why didn't they just start harvesting from the kids?  \n\n  \nLastly, something that always nags at me in these kind of post apocalyptic movies-- what were the zombie rules? It seemed random when and what would startle the cranks. They could be talking loudly and using flashlights, but the moment the power comes up the cranks come running? Or the sewer zombie-- comes alive to eat the rat, but didn't notice two large humans before that? ", "I enjoyed the movie. I don't know how it's related to the maze from the first movie though.

As someone who didn't read the books, I barely understand the backstory of this dystopian world at all. There were way too many meaningful pauses and \"let's go let's go\" when they could have used that time to explain everyone's motivations for the extreme decisions they were making.\n\n#2 Thomas and his group escape certain death by a hair's width dozens of times in this movie. I can suspense my disbelief to some extent but Thomas always manages to roll away from a boulder or find a stick at the exact moment he needs it. It makes Thomas into too \"perfect\" a character that he never has a scratch on him despite all he's up against. \n\nOverall, I still enjoyed the action, violence and landscapes of the movie. Also, Dylan O'brien was a great lead in this movie and Thomas' decisions and emotions seemed very real and engaged me more in the movie. However, his motivations for those decisions were undeveloped and overall the backstory for the movie is lacking. \n\nI would recommend this movie to action and dystopian fiction fans who aren't big sticklers for everything making sense. If those inconsistencies drive you crazy, you won't like this movie.", "I thought it was a really entertaining movie. It felt like a completely different movie from the first one, but not in a way that I wasn't able to enjoy it. As someone mentioned I got major \"I Am Legend\" and \"Mad Max\" vibes from this movie, which made is awesome. I thought the sets and the scenery were great. Dylan Obrien was good as usual, as was most of the supporting cast. The only two characters I could not stand was Janson (because of his shitty American accent) and Teresa because Kaya is just not all that great of an actress to me personally. I was not really expecting the zombie theme to play a part in this movie but I am not complaining because I love zombies. The sewer zombies were some of the scariest zombies I have ever seen IMO. The movie also ended at a good place that keeps you wanting more but doesn't leave you with major blue balls. Overall I was very entertained and had a good time.

The movie kept me entertained, which is what I most want from a movie. Would I watch it again? Nah. ", "What I like about the visit, in regards to the comedy, is that it was extremely realistic. Instead of always having a small level of comedy during everything to warrant a \"horror comedy\" classification, it instead is a lot more natural. The kids had no reason to be upset or scared in the beginning because following a natural development they wouldn't be. Likewise, in the end, they didn't have any jokes left because of the severity of the situation. In short, the kids were only cracking jokes when it would make sense for a child to do so in the given situation, whether that situation be nervousness or boredom. Maybe with the exception of the \"thing that my brother made me include\".", "The misdirection was pretty great in this movie. There are two instances of recurring odd circumstances, one of which is relevant to the twist (the visitors inquiring about the grandparents' absence) and the first, which is a red herring (the two former actors spouting lines to the documentarian).", "The ending was almost a little too happy. Was sort of expecting and wanting another twist. Like the creature or the mom wasn't the real mom, Idk something.", "Just got back from seeing it with my girlfriend. We both loved it. The film reminded me of classic horror, that focuses more on tension/creep factor rather than gore/supernatural elements. It was like a more fleshed out \"When A Stranger Calls\". Although I found it more creepy, because of how the intruder is handled in this case.\n\nI see a lot of people say they saw the twist a mile away, but I don't think the twist was supposed to be hard to figure out. The movie is actually pretty straightforward, even with the grandparents even explaining their issues to the kids. Like I said, it's more about the creep factor, and seeing these kids get sucked into a bad situation (and it makes it all the more interesting, because the kids have a broken family, and are trying really badly to make something of this trip). \n\nDespite the twist, the whole situation was really creepy/tense. I wouldn't say the film was \"scary\". But again, a lot of classic horror isn't scary either. It gives you the jitters, and keeps you tense. And this film did that brilliantly.\n\nI also loved how balanced the film was with comedy/horror. It's a weird experience to be laughing, while also feeling tense. I know some people didn't like the brother, but I loved him. Thought the child actors in this film were really damn good, and had great chemistry/acting performances. It really sold the family plot, and was charming for most of the film.\n\nThe other thing I really liked, was how the film justifies the found footage format. And unlike other found footage movies, the camera isn't always shaky and shitty quality, most of the shots look really good (and it's believable, because 4K cameras now exist, as do other portable professional video cameras). But the logistics of why everything is being filmed, totally holds up (because of the family plot, and why they went on the trip). There was only ONE part in the film, where logically it no longer made sense to be holding the camera. But I can give it a pass because 99% of the film it DID make sense, and plus they do at least justify it by the girl wanting to be a filmmaker. Or rather, her personality at least kind of loosely justifies it. \n\nFinally, I just thought the ending really was sweet, and brought the whole thing together. M Night did a good job having a through line plot that was underlying the entire thing. \n\nReally really thought this was great. ", "They pulled a Cabin in the woods on us.

I mean, when was the last time anyone saw a movie where they were cracking up one minute and about to shit a brick the next? The scene where the Grandma was playing hide and seek (dear God) and then exposing her butt the next I think sums it up perfectly; It was perfectly absurd. And the \"twist\" was actually pretty good. 7.5/10.", "I've gotta say that I'm surprised so many people seemed to like this movie. The rapping was beyond annoying, the daughter was supposed to be what, 15 or so?

You're forced to sit through a white kid's excessively long rapping three times. (SPOILERS) At the end he does another rap about how him and his sister killed the grandparents lightheartedly, like the kids wouldn't be super fucked up over that. Plus the girl couldn't look in the mirror cause her dad left but now she's looking at the mirror YAY PROBLEM SOLVED!\n\nThe mom's monologue at the closing didn't make much sense to the film either. I don't think the grandparents were motivated by anger, only her, but it's not like it's her fault her parents were killed. The ending would've been better if it was changed overall.", "I saw it a few weeks ago at an advanced screening, so my memory's a bit hazy on specifics, but I really enjoyed it. The marketing is way off, though. Pretty much every commercial I've seen is pushing it as a pure horror movie as opposed to the horror-comedy that it is. Heck, everyone in this thread who refers to the comedy as \"comedic relief\" is a great example as to how off the marketing is.\n\nPeople who are looking for a straight horror movie will be either disappointed or pleasantly confused. There are some wonderfully tense sequences (the Yahtzee scene comes to mind), but the majority of \"scares\" are obnoxious jump scares. But if you come to it looking for bizarre dark comedy, you'll probably be pleased. The performances are strong overall. I know a lot of people are complaining about the little boy, thinking that he's distracting from the dramatic tension, but I thought he was hilarious, definitely a natural.\n\nThe biggest drawback for me was the twist. It doesn't really hold up after the fact to much critical thinking. And actually, it kinda cheapens everything that comes before it. It just seems too easy to explain away all the grandparents' interesting behavior with \"oh, yeah, they were just crazy people, doing crazy people things.\" But hey, I've only seen it once. Maybe in a second viewing I'll notice more clues/foreshadowing/etc.\n\nANYWAY, it's a good movie.

However nobody seems to have shared my view of the film and hence the reason for this comment.\n\nI thought without question that the moment just after Caleb slips for the second time. Loomis grabs the rope and authentically tries to save him. Caleb gives him a look and see's the effort on Loomis face and how hard he is trying to save him and the care that is genuinely there from this kind man, even though he had just teased him by calling him jelous and suggesting he would stay around as there may not be anything to find further south. \n\nEven after Caleb had tried his best to irritate John, John still cared enough to save the man that could potentially take away the woman he loved. Going back to the point at the waterfall, there is a good 5 second clip where Caleb is looking at John as he is holding the rope and saving his life. I believe at this moment Caleb realized that he was intruding and ruining a genuine love and healthy relationship between two kind people trying to find their way in this new world. I genuinely think Caleb took the suit and left for the south, in hope of finding what he was searching for originally.\n\nMy main reasons for this looking back over, and as I said I didn't even believe anything other at the time, was:\n\nJohn was a kind and honest man, He admitted the potential murder of Anne's brother and showed deep regret, I don't think he would be able to kill him, as he already had the chance the first time Caleb slipped and he saved him twice without a seconds hesitation. \n\nCaleb never originally planned to stay and originally was only going to camped out on their land for one night. He seemed like a lost soul and wandered towards an endless goal, I don't believe he was evil or a scoundrel but simply a less emotional person than John. He essentially helped Anne and John and the majority of the work could not have been completed without him. \n\nIf we were to look into both John and Caleb the movie shows how they both have Vices, Calebs is Anne, a short term 'fast' relationship, and John's was alcohol, he was violent and very different when he had been drinking. \n\nI think the difference between John and Caleb was that they simply wanted different things but from the same woman. I don't however believe that John killed Caleb, I mean would he really fall from that spot and not damage the wheel at all? Are we supposed to believe that John re-entered the radioactive water to retrieve his body and then bury it? This just doesn't seem realistic to me. \n\nMy only explanation for the Loomis contemplating suicide would be his doubt that he could get Anne back from Caleb, we've all felt like giving up in our life and I think this was just a representation of that feeling. \n\nI think the fact that this filmed has provoked my mind enough into writing this and delving so deep into human emotion and the whole hidden plot in this movie translates to a suggestion that this film was a true testament to the fact that sometimes 'less is more' - Although the majority of audience wanted a set in stone ending, it's nice to write your own in your mind some times. \n\nI'd love to see if anyone aggrees!

Pros: the acting was, in general, better in my opinion, particularly the chemistry between the James and Shannyn was wonderful. The movie also had more of a thriller component to it: instantly, the family is on the run from an unnamed, unknown man, which then couples nicely with James' quest to stop the murders. Because the first film foregrounded the nature of Bughuul and his victims, this film could play with that knowledge and add to it, focusing instead on plot and character. The multiple focuses on James, Shannyn, and the boys also provides a more cohesive, manifold understanding of how exactly these kids are moved to commit torturous murders. I believe that the music, and the snuff films, also were done fairly well; I'm glad they didn't go too over the top with some of them, instead relying on imaginative approaches with the available resources.\n\nSadly, cons: many of the scares were cheap, flashy, and unnecessary. Bughuul's constant visibility really diluted his potential horror. But, I think, much of the horror lies in the powerlessness of the protagonists: Shannyn cannot protect her kids, James cannot protect them (until the first fire burns), and then Dylan (or Zach, whichever name was which), who dies because he fails to complete his film.

I liked what they tried to do by showing us the kids perspective of the events, I also liked that they had So & So return so we can have the first films events represented.

I get from a story perspective that they needed the kids to talk but unfortunately once we have them on the screen regularly they become less and less scary.  Also I was disappointed by the \"snuff\" films in this one, they were more silly then disturbing, guess they felt they should try and up the gore and violence as opposed to something truly unsettling.  Overall I though the acting was decent from some of the actors (so & so, the mom, Dylan) and I liked the idea of where they wanted to take the story but unfortunately they forgot to include the horror part.

", "My biggest take aways from this movie were several fold:\n\n1) I thought this was the best acting I've seen from Kristen Stewart.  I will fully admit I haven't seen her in much; a couple of the Twilight movies and Adventureland are the big ones.  I honestly thought she knocked it out of the park.  Her character as a whole was a bit uneven, but I don't think that was any fault of hers.  The chemistry between her and Eisenberg when they're just having some of their couple-y moments were particularly good.\n\n2) On the other side, I didn't think Jesse Eisenberg was anything special.  Other people have mentioned that there was a real odd discord between the writing of his character.  I don't even know how you would pull off a stoner-assassin correctly.  I know he's kind of made his career, besides a couple stand outs like Social Network, around being Not-Michael-Cera (who conversely makes his career around being Not-Jesse-Eisenberg) but I think you could have swapped the two actors in this movie and it would've been exactly the same.  My biggest take away from him in this movie honestly is I have renewed worry about him being any sort of decent Lex Luthor.  I'm holding out hope that he pulls it off, and I'm aware they're obviously different types of roles, but between this movie and the first BvS trailer, I'm not encouraged\n\n3) Topher Grace was phenomenal.  His performance was absolutely nothing special, he was just playing Topher Grace the asshole, but it is just great in this movie.  Well cast part.  I was particularly a big fan of the scene where he was talking to Howell on the phone from the command center (\"Oh it is you\").\n\n4)  Connie Britton was fine.  My only real exposure to her has been Friday Night Lights and Nashville, so seeing her be a complete badass and spit some vitriolic lines at Topher Grace was fun.  No problems here.\n\n5)  Bill Pullman was awesome in his grand total of 2 minutes of screentime\n\nAll the acting aside this movie was overall a bit too odd for its own good I think.  It was a real fun idea, but somewhere along the way it managed to trip over it's own oddness and attempts at CIA intrigue and fell a little short.  The combat scenes were all great set ups with lackluster executions.  Jump cuts and obfuscations abound really take the air out of every action set.  I mean the final fight scene has an AWESOME setup and premise [Final Scene Spoiler](#s \"Yates setting it up perfectly with \"He will come in quietly and secretly, start picking us off one by one\" followed with the bombastic firework-shooting-humvee entrance.  Not only that, you then put Howell, who has a reputation for being able to kill people with anything in a gigantic Wal-mart esque place.  This is a GREAT set up.  Everything then happens in poor lighting with smoke and jump cuts.  You never see him do anything amazing besides hitting people in the head with things.\")\n\nOverall I give it a 6/10.  I saw it for free at a prescreening.  I wouldn't even regret having paid normal ticket price to see it.  I would even go so far as to tell my friends who are action movie fans to go see it if they were interested in the premise.  Would I watch it again ever?  Doubtful", "Really enjoyed this.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was genuinely on the edge of my seat the entire movie.\n\nThe most impressive parts to me were the fight scenes, which were always inventive and surprising, considering our main character often went into the Frey with no weapon in hand. The acting by Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, I felt, was top-notch. I felt engrossed in their story and found their characters to be quite well-rounded(and I'm not much of a Kristen Stewart fan).\n\nThe plot was pretty solid, and well-paced.

I thought Jesse Eisenberg and Kristin Stewart both did great jobs.  Lequizamo and Tony Hale are always hilarious.  But overall, it kind of felt like  a first draft of a high concept flick.  \n\nI wish I could know how I'd feel about it without having seen the trailers, because there weren't really any surprises.  Phoebe's inevitable \"betrayal\" was telegraphed with Mike's ape story, and was the only real curve of the movie.  I don't feel like I gained anything from seeing it.  Didn't really explore any meaningful themes as far as I could surmise.  Kind of statically shot.\n\nI wanted it to be a little more stylish and off the rails.  I was hoping for a stoner comedy where the conceit is that the burnout is really a Jason Bourne type.  But it as more of a Bourne movie that starts with a stoner protagonist.  I wanted it to be quirkier I guess.  For how over the top Grace's villain was, I wanted to see him go crazier.  For how pyschotic the Laugher was supposed to be, I wanted him to be more sinister. \n\nOver all it just seemed like a straightforward story with a bunch of repeating scenes.  \"Bad guys chase, stoner kills them/escapes, feels bad about it or is confused how it happened, gets to next safe spot.\"  \n\nI don't feel like my time was wasted, but I also don't feel like I'd have lost anything if I had never seen it.  The trailer pretty much *was* the movie, save for the little twist where Phoebe was Mike's handler and Mike beating the CIA.  \n\nI wish it was a little more daring, and didn't play the premise so straight.  It seemed suffocated by not being tongue in cheek. \n\n5.5/10", "I really enjoyed the chemistry between  Eisenberg and Stewart.\n\n", "By far the best role Kristen Stewart has done. Finally a role that she worked well in.", "The fact that the Apollo ape story about the dog serving man instead of ape was such \"I should have noticed that sooner\" foreshadowing for how the CIA guy (with the DOG ringtone) ends up betraying the CIA (the brute ape) and siding with the good guys (humans). ", "Honestly, this is my new favorite film of the year. It's definitely not for everyone, and it's bug nuts weird. I get why people are divided so down the middle.\n\nThe trailers advertised a fun, light, silly stoner action-comedy. While the action was legitimately thrilling and inventive, (I was delightfully shocked at how brutal some of those kills were. I actually couldn't stop myself from yelling, \"holy shit,\" a couple of times - much to my embarrassment.) and the humor *is* ridiculous and fun, (the puppy exchange between Britton and Pullman at the end had me dying - also, every line of dialogue Leguizamo had.) I was floored by how much emotion the film had.\n\nWhile most of my audience was laughing during the first tree/car dialogue scene, much to my surprise - I started crying. The relationship between Eisenberg and Stewart was surprisingly poignant and wonderful, and I really found myself rooting for them. That scene where Mike remembers the last five years with Pheobe *KILLED* me, I was openly sobbing by that point.\n\nWhile from what I've seen people tend to be divided on Max Landis - the person, I thought the writing here was really special. All the supporting characters I thought were really well-rounded and had their own quirks, and felt human. In other films of this sort, characters like Tony Hale's and Walton Goggins' would be relegated to plot devices, and nothing more, but here, I found myself really caring about their outcomes. Especially Goggins, his last bit of dialogue destroyed me.\n\nI read something here where people thought Phoebe's reactions in the first half didn't fit given the reveal that she's Mike's former handler, but I absolutely thought they worked. Someone mentioned Phoebe's reaction towards Hawaii in the beginning of the film, but I immediately read that as her feeling guilt over her knowledge of the full life Mike can't have - \"I'M THE TREE\" (let's be honest, we all knew K-Stew was CIA from the first trailer).\n\nI don't know. All the ridiculous action, strange humor, and surprisingly poignant emotion came together in a weird concoction that felt honestly as if someone took my brain and my heart, and all the weird tastes that come with that, and put them into a film. (Even the fact that they needle dropped one of my favorite songs - The Chemical Brothers' Snow - for the emotional climax!) I loved it.\n\nAlso, the film had Tami Taylor firing off a shotgun in slow-motion. I mean, come on.\nClear eyes, full hearts, **BOOM BOOM**.\n", "Don\u2019t put a twist in the middle of your movie if it makes no sense. Halfway through the film we realise that Mike\u2019s girlfriend Phobe is actually his CIA handler. This changes the character dramatically and makes no sense for the first half of the movie. \n\n\nWhy was she surprised that Mike killed two people with a spoon? Why is she shocked that he was activated by the CIA lady? Why did she think Mike could go on vacation to Hawaii if he has panic attacks everytime he leaves town? Why did she never try to contact the CIA or try to find the CIA lady? I get that she was trying to hide the truth from Mike but all her actions in the first half make no sense. At least with the Sixth Sense, Fight Club or the Usual Suspects, the character made sense when you re-watch the film.\n\n\nAs for the overall tone. People have tried to describe this movie as a Jason Bourne mashup with Pineapple Express. This might have worked if the film wasn\u2019t so over the top violent. I find it weird that Mike was cracking stoner one liners while covered in the blood of a man he beat to death with a kettlebell. Tarantino seems to balance gory with humor, but if the character is acting with a detached sense of seriousness of the situation, it takes you out of the movie. Dude, people are actually trying to kill you. The goofy humor was bad Roger Moore/Austin Powers movie humor with his kills. Also Walter Googins was wasted as an over the top ridiculous bad guy. the final scene with him was quite good though.\n\n\nFinally this is an action movie and yet most fight sequences were so close up and quick cut you rarely see the action. In the credits you had two fight trainers for Jesse Eisenberg and they both were completely wasted. In the Bourne movies Matt Damon looked like he knew how to fight.\nIn this movie Jesse Eisenberg look like he was struggling. He even beat people up with frozen Hamburger meat. Yet there are times he leaves behind perfectly good guns in order to keep using his hands or improvised weapons. Like a bad McGuyver. \nThis movie had a creative premise that was ruined by uneven tone, a dislogical twist and action sequences that didn\u2019t even show the fights. They also put what is essentially a trailer of what is going to happen in the movie at the start of the movie.

Hope this film gets a sequel because I feel like this was a mere introduction to something even better. \n\n", "Goddamn that was an attractive cast. ", "I fucking LOVED this movie. The cinematography, the score, the interaction between Cavill, Hammer and Vilkander, the twists throughout the story, a female antagonist. I also loved the fonts and the filter that made it really feel like the 60's.  This was some of the most fun I have had at a theater all year. \n\nNow, how's that for entertainment?

I thought some of the dialog and some of the story was a little forced, but I think I got my money's worth.\n\nI think Cavill and Hammer worked very well together. And I thoroughly enjoyed Cavill in this role. ", "I went for Henry Cavill and thoroughly enjoyed everything he did", "I loved this movie.  It's not without a couple of structural flaws, and maybe lacking in character development, but I had a blast and enjoyed every second of it.  \n\nGuy Ritchie's style really lends itself to a classier spy movie.  I'm so used to seeing gritty work from him, that it surprised me how *clean* this movie was.  Extraordinarily well shot, framed, lit, and edited.  \n\nThe sound design was also fantastic. I think I sat in the acoustical \"sweet spot\" in my theater, but the 360 sound effects were really effective.  The music choices both in actual song choice and when/how to use the music was also really clever.  \n\nThe acting was great.  I bought Hammer's accent.  Everyone had great chemistry and timing.  \n\nIt was hysterical, which I actually didn't expect. I've never seen the show it's based on, and I thought it was a little more grounded. I was happy to see it didn't take itself very seriously. \n\nI see some people weren't crazy about the pacing, but I was entertained the whole time, and I didn't feel the length at all.  Might just be a subjective thing, but I thought it clipped along pretty efficiently and didn't overstay its welcome.  \n\nThe costuming and set design was really immersive.  I completely bought the period, and it felt like actually looking into the past.  Unlike something like American Hustle which hits you over the head with \"this movie takes place in the 70's! see all these references?\" It was subtle but complete.  \n\nI thought it set up a potential franchise pretty well.  I'd love to see more adventures from these guys, and it didn't feel terribly forced.  \n\nIt brought a few really clever twists to the spy genre.  First, I was glad to see it wasn't spies disavowed by their agencies, taking down the bad guy on their own for a shot at redemption.  There was cooperation and trust the whole way through, except between Solo and Illya.  I thought their dynamic was hilarious. Gave me a real \"spy vs. spy\" vibe, but with a friendly competition twist.  I thought that was clever.\n\nI thought there was some near Edgar Wright levels of visual humor.  \n\nHighly recommend! 8/10.  ", "Cavill and Hammer's banter was really good.

With the \"What are you doing *down there*\" line and the ass shots of women, I was expecting a subpar 'James Bond feat. Angry Russian' action flick, but I was beyond pleasantly surprised. \n\n* The cinematography was spot on from the first shot and stayed that way throughout. The colours, costume and effects - the split screen, those fast jumps - all evoked the '60s vibe. The editing was brilliant, allowing time to be spent on the fun scenes without creating too much of a drag. \n* No clunky exposition - Cavill speaking to Vikander at the start could have explained things at great length, but instead it was delivered as 'here are the facts, you can process them later because here comes action'. (Which, imo, is how this sort of film should be.)\n* And for a spy caper, I was surprised at how much I actually connected to the characters. Cavill was supposed to be the stock womaniser, but there still felt something fresh about his acting. Hammer and Vikander stole the show, though - and Gaby was brilliant, a breath of fresh air in terms of female heroines. Rather than being a 'strong' woman who can - gasp! - punch a guy, she was well-rounded and unique. \n* Elizabeth Debicki's villain Victoria was more predictable, but I did like how she played for herself: I've seen a few complaints that her husband was underdeveloped, but he was neither the brains nor brawn behind the operation. So the characters didn't act like he was. (And he clearly didn't mean much to her - she was the one who decided to sleep with Solo.)\n\nAll in all, this film felt refreshing and enjoyable. Well-written, with strong direction by Guy Ritchie, and great acting by the leads. Just like Fury Road and John Wick earlier this year, it really felt like it brought something new to action. Loved it.", "This is easily my favourite thing Guy Ritchie has done. It was so slick and stylistic, the cast are fantastic and the humour was just perfect.

Henry Cavill does an excellent job as the typical American Bond spy and Armie delivers a convincing performance as a KGB blunt weapon and does the \"man constantly on the breaking point\" character pretty well for someone who looks more like a handsome leading man than a manic bodybuilder.\n\nThe music is on point as are the sound effects and great sequences that utilize both the foreground and background to fantastic action/comedic effect often at the same time. Ritchie has a really deft hand when it comes to showcasing something as mundane as a character holding up a piece of paper and it's great to see him continue to add interesting editing techniques to his ever increasing repertoire.\n\nHowever, the largest complaint I had with the flick that I suspect many other people will have as well is that it definitely drags in parts and can outstay its welcome. As a brisk 90 min film or even less, this would probably be getting slight to significantly better reviews. Guy Ritchie works best when he goes at full speed, and it's not till he slows down that you're able to start picking apart the problems. \n\nAll in all I had a good time and will probably see it again when it comes out at home, I hope it does well enough that he gets to play around with another film of this budget.", "Very likeable characters, stylishly shot, retro cool, quippy comedy and some good action scenes.

This could have been an amazing movie. However, with the script that it had, it was only good. That said, I still enjoyed the living daylights out of it and am probably going to go see it again.\n\n**The Good**:\n\n* Everything and every one was so exasperatingly *pretty*. Henry Cavill and Alicia Vikander defy all scientific explanation. Elizabeth Debicki and Armie Hammer are also easy on the eye. The costuming was impeccable and the sets were beautifully designed. The movie's entire philosophy was old school cool and it delivered.\n\n* The movie didn't take itself too seriously as a spy movie. A lot of the reviews I read criticised this element and suggested that the film half-arsed its genre, but I enjoyed that as a strength of the film. It's partially a piss-take on the genre, and although that might have been un-intentional, it worked in its favour. We've had enough serious spy movies of late.\n\n* The humour was bizarre. I didn't laugh at the banter so much as I did at some of the situations in which the characters found themselves. The scene where Solo eats a sandwich while Illya goes to shit in the water was glorious. The scene where Gaby makes Illya dance was glorious. Basically, most things happening at Illya's expense were glorious.\n\n* Armie Hammer's Russian accent. It won't go down as a seminal display of thespian prowess, but I enjoyed it.\n\n* The music. Holy shit, the music. I'd say it was responsible for a huge part of the film's enjoyable atmosphere.\n\n* Henry Cavill. Because he's pretty and I'm weak. \n\n**The Meh**:\n\n* Henry Cavill's American accent. It was decent, but he sounded like Hugo Weaving's Mr Anderson. Sometimes it was kind of hard to understand what he was saying?\n\n* A lot of forced banter. Too much of it. The problem is that most of it was relatively mundane. Cocked eyebrows and sarcastic tones will only take you so far when your banter is vanilla.\n\n* The storyline. Too much time spent on some scenes (the racing rally), too speedy a progression on some elements of the story (the introduction of the alliance came very quickly), and insufficient development of otherwise important characters (Victoria's husband, the death of whom was significant for the plot but felt unremarkable).\n\nI'm really hoping there's a sequel. They've shamelessly set one up in the final scene, and I hope they go through with it. I also hope they take more care with the script and plot. ", "It was a very good film. I like how it took the shows fun to the big screen. It was extremely cast, and the two leads both excellent, along with Vikander (who was really the breakout star of it all).

It was basically an extended car chase with little payoff. The villains also had no presence. The dude, well forget about it, he might as well not be there. The actual villain was dispatched without much effort. All in all, felt like MI5, good movie, weak ending. \n\nPeople keep talking about Cavill here. But I think Hammer stole the show. Cavill basically just played a parody of Bond, whereas Hammer's character had some nuance. \n\nAll in all, very much worth a watch. My gf actually said to me that the leads made her hot and bothered.

Cavill was clearly the number 1 here and just felt too perfect, so I would have liked it if they came to blows more often. That first time they interacted was amazing and I hope if they make more, a lot more scenes are like that one.\n\nAlso the watch gag was good. A subtle reference on the helicopter when Grant was mentioning when their assault would take place and Hammer looked at his watch real quick then looked sad. I for some reason keep laughing about that scene.\n\nMy full [review is here](http://gorgview.com/the-man-from-uncle), but this one kind of sucks, so you can ignore it. ", "I think my biggest issue with this film was the edit. They could have trimmed almost a full half an hour off this and it would have tightened up immensely. Every aspect that worked well worked well until it went on a juust bit too long. I kept thinking to myself throughout the movie, did they board this scene out to run this long? No one during the edit thought maybe we could cut this sequence down? That sequence down?\n\nIf it was trimmed down a bit and maybe that extreme sports/drone chase was a bit less chaotic and more thought out I would have loved it. Cavil was so fun to watch and Arnie's character came into his own once the movie got going and they started playing off each other more.\n\nAlso, I never watched the show...was the split screen stuff a nod?

I wouldn't recommend it to everyone as the depiction of the police is pretty one sided and cynics could definitely see this as one big commercial for Dre's empire, especially with the closing credits, but I would 100% recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in it.\n\nOverall the pieces were all done well. The acting was solid with Ice Cube's son absolutely nailing it. Giamatti was really fun to watch while NWA was on the come up, and I never had a problem believing I was watching a young Dre or Eazy. There were tons of \"aha!\" moments for rap fans too. The appearance of Snoop, that scene where Dre was coming up with Chronic beats and Snoop started going in, Eazy trying to rap for the first time, the Tupac scene. I loved how the movie ended with Dre creating Aftermath Entertainment. It was cool because he had learned to stop letting people leech off his talent through management, even though really it kinda makes the movie a commercial for what he's build since. But it was still a really cool moment. I was actually kinda hoping it'd end with him making the beat to Xxplosive or Forgot About Dre, but the final scene was cool.\n\nThere was a ton of humor done really well by the way the characters talked to each other, but when the movie got real it got pretty real. There were a lot of really emotional scenes, and I can definitely say that just about every person in my theater was audibly crying for the last 20 minutes, which I thought was pretty impressive in a movie about gangster rap.\nI thought it was pretty cool that Eazy, Dre, and Cube seemed to all be protagonists. NWA wasn't the protagonist, they broke up about halfway through, but each of them seemingly got equal screen time and character depth. I really appreciated that.\n\nOverall I think it was a little long, but that's pretty standard for these kinds of movies. I never thought I'd get so emotional hearing a crowd of people yell, \"Fuck tha police!\" and that concert scene was really great. Really well shot movie that felt authentic and wasn't afraid to get kinda real. Plus there was ass everywhere. Seriously, some of those asses had me fanning myself.\n\nGood movie, not going to be the best of the year but I'd recommend it. Fuck Suge.", "Just finished up the movie a few minutes ago. \n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n-Excellent, excellent sound mixing and use of music. The concert scenes killed.\n\n-The young actors were fantastic.\n\n-Suge gets his.\n\n-Bye, Felicia!\n\nOverall, a bit long, but there's a ton of ground to cover, so that's fine. The movie doesn't pivot (rise to breakup to peace) as well as it could have, but it does such a great job of immersing you in the story that it's easy to ignore.", "Just got home.\n\nPretty solid biopic IMO. Acting was terrific, Ice Cubes son nailed him. The guy playing Suge Knight also did a fantastic job.\n\nReally would've liked to see them not be held up on such a pedestal, the movie makes it seem like they never did a bad thing in their lives. But hey, when you're producing the movie, you're not gonna vilify yourself. \n\nWouldve liked to know more about MC Ren and DJ Yella but the movie would be four hours long if they did that. \n\nOverall I'd give 7.5/10, one of the better movies I've seen this summer.", "Honestly, I thought it ended sort of abruptly, but maybe that's because I just wanted it to never end! I thought that maybe this was just gonna be an okay movie about a rap group that was sort of revolutionary. I was wrong. This movie was great. The acting (especially Ice Cube's son), the music, the energy, the seriousness, everything was just really well done. ", "Damn almost 400 comments and no mention of the cinematography? \n\nI thought Matthew Libatique did a great job at creating the look of the movie, everything was extremely well lit and shot. I wouldn't say it was awards worthy caliber of anything, but I think he deserves a lot of credit for what he delivered. I know the director usually gets all the credit when the movie is good but imo the cinematography was just a step above the directing in this case, I really wasn't a fan of that Eazy E/Jerry breakup scene, it comes to mind as a sequence that definitely could have been handled better...but as far as the cinematography it was pretty much always on point. That opening sequence with Eazy E, the Detroit concert/running off stage, and even the riots scenes were all *very* well done. \n\nI also noticed a couple long takes that I thought really enhanced some of the scenes, particularly the stripper hotel scene that ended with Cube's \"Bye Felicia.\" Great stuff from Libatique!", "Was a young woman in my mid-20s living a deep street life with an old-school black power-movement agitator in his 40s when NWA hit.  They were shouting out loud the way we talked and lived and what we smoked. And young white kids were in the store buying the stuff. It was an INSANE moment.  For me now, at 52, it's cool to see this history playing out into a mainstream movie (a bit Disney-fied in a not bad way) and God did I love getting to attend that NWA Detroit concert from my seat last night.  I'm afraid a lot of the very young white kids who attended last night and who didn't stay to watch the out-takes with the real NWA footage will retain only vague stereotypes of these very \"other\" seeming Americans, but they will have at least a dimly better understanding of what the police state killings and protests are about today.  I have been trying for 25 years now to capture in writing what I saw and experienced as a woman in those years.  I will never forget placing the needle on the vinyl and hearing that album for the very first time.  We literally shouted with shock and joy.  We were killing ourselves with how we were living, but somehow, it was BEAUTIFUL. And NWA was SAYING it.", "Loved when Oshea Jackson Jr Ice Cube referenced the fact that his girl was pregnant with Oshea Jackson Jr", "Just got out of the theatre, really loved this movie. As far as a biopic it seemed to display the story very well without much embellishment, from why I already knew of the story. I really enjoyed that even when NWA split it managed to continue to tell the story of each of the three as they made their own way without disrupting then flow of the film. All the actors were spot on, I was surprised how much each of them looked like the real thing, especially tupac. The humour was well placed without seeming cheesy or trying too hard. \n\n...and of course the music was on point. Every scene in the studio was lit. Also very much appreciated the ass and titties. \nI'm feeling a strong 8 to a light 9, shit was \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 fam", "Any expecting \"Crossroads\" by Bone Thugs to start playing after Eazy died or at least during the credits? ", "I really liked this movie. Lots of fan service in it. Especially the Tupac scene. Fuck Suge Knight for interrupting California Love! \n\nAlright, now for the problems... The god damn theatre. The film was great. The audience was a solid 0/10. Three people were kicked out for shouting at Suge Knight, or trying to freestyle over Dre's beats. The people next to me kept singing along to every song. Congrats, you know the lyrics to a song that came out 25 years ago. It's not a concert. It's a movie. If you want to rap, do it on the bus ride home like Eminem...Two guys almost got into a fight during the movie. Calm down, alright? I know you're into the movie, but you're not Ice fucking Cube beefing with Eazy-E. You're Tyler yelling at Gary, and no one gives a fuck. Shut up and watch the damn movie. \n\nIf you're gonna see this movie. Follow the golden rule of theatres (and life): Don't Be A Dick", "Suge Knight is apparently suing Dre and Cube for making him look soft in the film.", "I loved this film.\n\nWhen Straight Outta Compton was released I was a 12 year old, mid-western, suburban white kid and I was not allowed to listen to it. So naturally it was my favorite album.\n\nI grew up listening to all of their music and still buy everything they produce. I clearly couldn't relate to anything they talked about, but I think that's what I loved about it. It was dangerous, crazy, and exciting. It was a window into a world I knew nothing about and couldn't imagine living in day-to-day. Their was a lot of shock value to their music which help resonate their message. \n\nI feel the film was told from this point-of-view. It felt like a very polished, Hollywood-style version of their story. I'm OK they didn't dwell on Easy's past. I'm OK that they didn't show Dre beating up Dee Barnes. I'm even OK with the \"happily-ever-after-Look how-fucking-rich-we-are\" montage ending.\n\nCube said in an interview the other day that the original cut of this film was 4 hours. I look forward to watching it when I buy the Blu-ray but I'm glad the theatrical cut is just the way it is.\n\n\n\n", "Dr. Dre with the last line of the movie.\nAftermath gets the last laugh.", "When I first discovered into NWA a few years ago, I was so entranced by the ferocity and style that it felt surreal to think this was all 25 years in the past. But I treated it as something from the past, and my initial burst of excitement with them slowly died down as I expanded my taste in hip hop. \nThen I heard Ice Cube announced there was going to be a movie. I had low expectations for this; this possibly couldn't be what I thought it would be. It HAD to be too good to be true. But I waited and saw the trailer. I was hyped beyond belief. Then I saw the reviews, increased my hype.\n\nBut I was scared that they would make a misstep. After watching this, I can safely say that Straight Outta so many levels with me, excitement, anger, and sadness. As a film itself, it handled three main characters very well, although it focused on Eazy the most, it seemed. The film is packed with action from the drug bust beginning to the riots and police assaults, but never too over the top in that case at least. The humor is actually really top notch and flows well with the pace not seeming to take you out of the drama aspect (maybe except \"Bye Felicia\"). This is overall a very solid movie.\n\nHowever, there are a few problems in this movie that I realized. The police are very one dimensional and Suge Knight is basically the devil in mob boss form. This doesn't hurt the film too much as the movie is mostly about the interaction between all three protagonists. That being said, the omission of the entire Dre-Eazy beef with Dre Day and Real Muthafukkin G's may have happened for time reasons but I feel like it could've added to the tragedy of Dre seeing a comatose Eazy even more. Also another note is MC Ren being reduced to a tertiary character. It makes sense plotwise so it isn't exactly a fault, but at least Yella had some funny one liners. I honestly feel bad for the guy as he vocally expressed how shafted he felt after not seeing himself in the trailer.\n\nBut again, the movie as a whole performs excellently and is one of my favorites for the year.", "I thought it would be good, but damn it was really good", "Fantastic movie. \n\nAs someone who was 12 when this all started, I felt like a flashback of my teenager years and how gangsta rap still holds a place all these years. \n\nBest part for me was wanting to rap along with them. Can't believe I still know all the words. ", "Holy shit what a ride. Damn can say that this is now one of my favorite movies of the year. Really great story, brilliant performances not just by the main 3 protagonists but all across the board. Had a perfect mix of humor, drama, and suspense. By the end of the movie, I shed a couple of tears. Didn't expect a movie about gangster rap to be SO good. Everything was just done really well. \n\nFavorite moments\n\n-First studio scene with Eazy E rapping for the first time. \n\n- Jerry standing up for his artists outside the studio. Man Paul Giamatti was fucking great in this movie. \n\n-N.W.A. playing Fuck The Police when they weren't suppose to. The moment before they dropped the song was great when they were talking about how the police tried to tell them what they can't say. Then Cube goes \"Dre drop that shit!\" and you just see the looks in the cops eyes. The whole chase scene after was great too. \n\n-Hotel scene where the dude tries to find his girl Felicia. \"Bye Felicia!\" Loved how hard the N.W.A. was with all their big ass guns haha. \n\n-Ice Cube reading the Friday Script. Him reading the \"You knocked the fuck out line\" and his girl asking how's friday. \"Damn this shits funny!\" \n\n-When Dre was recording 2pac and goes outside of the studio to call out Suge and the whole party.\n\n-Eazy E seeing the success of Dr. Dre's Chronic in the billboard ad, man I really felt for E here.\n\n-Ice Cube fucking shit up in Priority Records. \n\n-One emotional scene that really hit me hard when Dre talks to E when he's in his coma. He starts talking casually with jokes and stories, then in the moment, realized that his friend is dying, and just breaks down. One of the most emotional moments for me.\n\nI can name seriously way more scenes just because that movie was that good. I'm definitely gonna rewatch this in theaters before it leaves. \n\n", "Did Pac play himself? Jesus, that guy looked just like him. \n\nOverall - very good, drastic tonal shifts, overall length, and messy subplots aside. Great performances, the live NWA stuff is incredible, and you almost forgive anything after a near perfect first hour. ", "Anyone else go into this expecting to see people get shot? I don't think a single shot was fired except for the cops shooting during the concert riot.", "Paul Giamatti standing around awkwardly with his arms crossed during the first NWA recording session is me in all group social situations.", "When I saw Ice cubes son start rappin no vasiline i almost came", "Best movie I've seen in awhile - ice cube's son inherited his old man's talent, he was fantastic. Did a great job of taking his father's scowl and channeling it. Scary scene that turned funny, cube on bus that crip got on, only to get back and explain the day as being crazy and being lectured by a gang member. \n\nHis \"bye Felicia\" lime was classic as well. Curious if that really happened. \n\nTwo thumbs up, gave me more of an appreciation for rap and what it was all about back then. This white boy from the suburbs for educated. ", "There have been many misses as far as musical biopics in the past decade. This one was the exception.  Holy hell, was it great.  The acting was surprisingly superb given the amount of young and rather unknown actors, the music and mixing was great, and the film didn't seem too long.  Overall, if you're a fan of west coast hip hop, you need to watch this movie.

Ice Cubes son captures Ice cubes integrity perfectly and seeing the songs chronologically paired with real time events was so fucking cool. thats something Notorious (2007) never captured.", "Watched an advanced screening on Wednesday, and I thought it was great and I loved it. If you are a fan of rap music or just music in general, you will hopefully enjoy this film.\n\n The acting is great and the story gives a strong emotional appeal. I wasn't a very big Eazy-E fan going into the film, but now I truly appreciate his music and his lasting legacy.", "Just saw, I loved this movie.  Best casting ever.\n\nAlso I just want to say, that I found it really surreal watching a movie which essentially brings me back to my young adulthood, while sitting amongst 100% of people who were not born before Easy E died.\n\nAlso who brings a baby to Straight Out of Compton?   Young parents of course!    Thanks for being awesome respectful parents and tag teaming when the baby got a bit fussy!   You gave me hope for the future today.", "My only gripe is that I we did not get a scene were Suge is holding Vanilla Ice out a window.", "That was a really good biopic.

My favorite scene was when they performed in Detroit, singing \"Fuck the Police\" when they were told they were gonna get arrested. This movie also tore me apart, mainly because of all the police brutality and excessive use force by them. The U.S. is all beginning to look like that again.

I'll go see the film again. I particularly liked that it had the feeling that the characters were riding the wave of the music.  The songs keep coming, and they move time along in the storyline.  Jason Mitchell does not resemble Eazy-E in the slightest, and doesn't sound like him at all either, which is really strange to me since Tomika Woods-Wright played a role in the making of the film.  Maybe this is how he appeared and sounded to her.  Or maybe she wants to preserve his image (like a \"no one can be you to me baby!\" kinda way?).  His voice was so unique that I really missed it (though you do hear it in some of the songs).   \n\nThe movie is a love letter to Eazy-E.  His story, role, artistic commitment, and business sense are all communicated very well, and he's constantly presented as an idealist.  ", "I have no complains about the movie and I had huge expectations. I easily expected it to be the film of the year for me. I loved how big of a deal they made of Eazy being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Huge backstory over it is that Eazy was calling Dre gay publicly to the masses for some work he did previous to NWA and the built up bitterness he had towards the breakup and trying to be released from his contract. However, while Dre ended up not being homosexual in the least as we all know, it's ironic because Eazy was the one who got the \"gay virus.\" So it really was much more than just him getting the terrible disease.

Your opinions on the characters change throughout the film. The film doesn't make you feel stupid either and doesn't hand feed you plot details. \n\nThe ending is just, what the fuck. I'm just really conflicted on it. Jason Bateman's character is a total dick and almost ruined Gordo's life but Gordo also might have gone too far. It also makes you think since Gordo may or may not have raped her before Simon beat him up. I also really don't know if Gordo did it or not.

Great wriiting by him and acting by all three leads.  It is number four on my best of the year list.", "I really enjoyed it.

I loved the idea that it really does not matter whether Gordo did it or not. Either way Simon's life is ruined already.", "The most satisfying solution I've come up with is that although Gordo had enough motive to just fabricate kindness towards the wife as a tool, he did not rape her. Raping her would be giving her an equal burden, and its likely he felt sympathy, if anything, towards her. Like others have commented, a paternity test (possibly along with the DVD evidence) could have proved whether or not it was a case of rape - and led to consequences for Gordo. Which is obviously a possibility, but I think we all got the impression that Gordo was very smart and had the goal of psychological revenge. Gordo would be getting much more out of *not* raping her. At the point where the movie ended, if Simon confronted his wife and accused Gordo of rape and a paternity test proved it wrong, Simon's relationship with his wife (and the baby that *is* his son) would be burdened even more. His wife had a solid trust in Gordo and was obviously set on leaving Simon, so a false rape accusation would look exactly like another one of his huge, slap-in-the-face lies to her; another reason to get herself and her son away from him. In addition to all of the psychological torture Gordo got to give Simon, Gordo would get the satisfaction of ruining Simon's potential for any father-son relationship, just as Simon destroyed the relationship between Gordo and his father.\n\nI know the goal isn't to \"figure out\" what happens beyond the movie's end, but I thought I'd share my perspective! The movie was amazing, and the fact that it has all of us capable of questioning so much proves that in itself.", "What I lile about this movie, and its going to sound odd, is the fight between Simon and Robin in the kitchen. Simon is such a dick. He says mean things, he cuts her off, he makes excuses, plays for sympathy and still comes off as a snot nosed child.  Its the way real fights are. Often in movies fights between a couple are no more than long winded speeches with slightly raised voices that ends in a tearful hug. This fight was mean and dirty and everyone in the audience has been in a fight like that.  I was sitting in the theater and everyone around me was in hushed tones saying \"what an ass\" \"dick\" etc. But they wete totally caught up in the moment.  And to further push it, Robin was caught stealing and taking pills. We are witnessing something that may not even be happening. Robin is unreliable, Simon is unreliable and an asshat. I loved it.

It honestly had me on the edge of my sheet, and the finale had me literally shaking in the theatre. One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time, probable since Gone Girl.

I fucking HATED him, which is amazing because he's such a likable guy.", "I believe that Gordo was doing this as a gift to Robyn, he saw that who she married wasn't right for her. So, his goal was to give her a gift of being free. Which normally divorce is viewed as a bad thing but at the dinner Gordo says that he sees bad events as a gift. I also believe that Gordo had something to do with Simon being found out for messing with his competition, further exposing him.", "Loved the movie. Everything from camera work to sound design to staging were impecacably done IMHO. The plot's beginning seemed a little slow and convoluted to me until we got to know more about Robyn. After that, however, it kept me engaged as it kept to the theme: making the audience feel and believe certain ideas just as Simon did others and just as Gordon did to Simon. Other films have thought provoking themes similar to this, but this film is one of the few that actually made me feel the ideas it was expressing by doing unto me what was being done to the characters. This allowed me to really reflect on the change in emotion I felt and think about what drove me to certain conclusions. There's more I like about this film but I won't get into it.\n\nOne clarification though (or at least an interpretation of mine): A lot of people seem unclear as to whether or not Gordon raped Robyn. It should be pointed out that Robyn was the only person that showed him compassion and that to me (and to a lot of people, apparently) is enough to convince me he didn't do it. One piece of concrete evidence to back this, however, is when Gordon says to Simon something along the lines of \"The truth is in his eyes\" (referring to the baby). At that moment there was a close up of Gordon's face. Gordon's eyes were light brown with a tinge of green and grey. The film then cuts immediately to Simon, who springs into action, but with a quick glance Simon's eyes were dark blue. When Simon approaches the window with Robyn and her child, even from a distance, Simon sees that the baby's eyes are dark. And so Gordon granted Simon that one gift of relief (heh heh get it?), while also screwing him over in every other way (in career, love life, and mentally).", "This was easily my top film of the year so far. I came out of the theater feeling like I was going to puke. The characters were realistically flawed and deep. Details are hidden throughout the film's dialogue which kept me listening until the end.

And that's only a tiny bit of hyperbole!", "I'm late to the party but I couldn't help but make a connection. Everytime Gordo gives something to the Simon and Robin it was always gift wrapped. When Robin breaks the news of her pregnancy to her husband, she gives a positive pregnancy test to him as a wrapped gift.

Very unsettling, very believable. Was more horrified by that than almost any horror film of late.  \n\nThe problem, though, with good suspense films is they often ask great questions, but the answers are never quite satisfying. I mean the way this was written, Jason Bateman was not just a bully, but an unsympathetic prick.  Yes, his acting (which was great) demonstrated that he didn't fully believe his 'winners and losers' mantra, but he could have stayed a shade more sympathetic.  And the story--that he started a rumor that Gordo was gay, leading to Gordo's Dad beating him (possibly burning him? This was never addressed), just wasn't quite the backstory I'd hoped for.  \n\nAnd when Bateman went and 'apologized,' I thought that was a little absurd. And finally, the ending seems easy to clear-up.  Not that it wouldn't be a horrifying 48 hours for Bateman, but a paternity test. If it's Gordo's, he has all the evidence on video to convince the guy of rape (it wouldn't be open shut, as he was in a mask).  \n\nAnd ultimately I don't think Gordo did it.

For one thing, a lot of the material in the trailer never got to the screen; I know that often happens, but I mean, it didn't even get *close* to the screen. That awesome shot of the thing as a pile of rubble in an erie corridor, for example. That was clearly never a part of *this* film. \n\nThere were also moments when the mask slipped a little, and some tiny fragments, hints and whispers, of a potentially great Cronenbergesque take on the situation manifest themselves. But they evaporate like mirages. There's about three minutes of Doom wrecking shit that was almost awesome, but that's it. \n\nUltimately, this felt like an entirely average TV pilot. It moved mechanically from point A, to B, to C; it established everything *just* enough, and then moved on. The scenes often lacked tension or stakes, and the end was incredibly rushed. \n\nI'm no Fantastic Four purist, and I'm not overly bothered by someone's bad behavior - if you judged directors on behavior, masterpieces like Aguirre, Wrath of God would never happen. But this film **STANK** of studio involvement, hack re-writes, and massive reshooting. Honestly, if Trank says there was a much better version, I'm highly inclined to believe him, because the parts all look good, and there could hardly be a worse version. \n\nOne example of glaring re-writes. When Richards is on the run, he seems to be trying to build his own one-man shuttle to the other side. This is immediately disgarded in the film, but I believe in another version he does go over, he meets Doom early, they have adecent face-off, and he comes back to warn them - hence the trailer line (now cut) \"I know what's coming - Doom.\" And there were plenty of moments like that, were you could see where the original film had been hacked away and rejiggered into this bad TV pilot. Instead there's a bland and far too short action scene, some quick lines form the Thing, and then he fixes the Governement version in '10 minutes' - which also felt like a bad rewrite, and a deliberate dig at Trank, as well. \n\nIf I were to blame anyone, I might be inclined to look at Kinberg, because if this was his original script, then it was terrible, and if this is what he did to 'rescue' the film, then he should have fought harder to keep it as it was.

Your neat handwriting had turned into a childish lime green scrawl and by the time the final bell rings, you can barely consider your work a fully formed essay.\n\nI can't remember a film in recent memory that nose dives as badly as F4 does in its second half. The film starts off pretty good, stellar acting from Miles Teller, good cinematography and a surprisingly interesting antagonist in gamer-recluse, Occupy Wall Street-version Victor Doom.\n\nThere's a couple of oddities like how Kate Mara isn't given anything to work with script wise, the fact a movie set in 2007 pretends like you can power a science project with a number of old Nintendo 64's and people listen to Portishead like its the 90's still, but overall I was enjoying the film's curiously slow build.\n\nAll that build up is thrown out the window when our heroes are teleported to another dimension.

Chronicle 2 this is not.", "worst \"clobberin' time\" reference evar!!!", "The real villain of this film, even scarier than Dr. Doom or The Thing, was Miles Tellers' facial hair.", "My review, in short: Once upon a time... The End!\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nSeriously, what happened here? The first half was really good, and the second half was really... not. Child actors aside, I liked everything up until Reed vanished from the facility. I liked the interaction between all the characters, especially Reed and Ben (despite how brief their screentime together was). \n\nThe science fair bit was cute, and Teller and Bell showed some great comedic chemistry with each other. Sue's character was interesting, since her being more guarded and introverted went along well with her powerset. Michael B. Jordan was good as Johnny, though it was a little unclear as to his relationship with Sue. Like, they're laughing together in one shot during the montage, and then he gives her the cold shoulder a few seconds later.\n\nHell, I even liked Victor ~~Domashev~~ Von Doom. His antisocial-ness was understated enough that it didn't seem corny, and the 'love triangle' between him, Reed and Sue didn't swallow up focus like it did in the Tim Story movies. You could tell that he was friends (or at least friendly) with Reed, rather than him always being a smarmy jackass like McMahon's was. \n\nThe first voyage to the other planet was better than expected. The interplay between the four guys didn't feel forced, the world was equal parts menacing and wondrous, and the score fit well. The body horror sections were excellent, definitely the best part of the movie. Seeing Reed's arms stretched out like that was so cool, and yet so creepy too. (That effect was definitely better here than in the old movies.)\n\nThen there's the time skip... and the whole movie falls apart. They easily cut 30-45 minutes from the middle of the movie and tried to patch things up with reshoots. This was especially obvious whenever Sue Storm's hair transformed into a wig, and when the dialogue became stock and cheesy. (And just an aside, whoever did the artwork and stuff for the computer screens in this movie should've been sacked. They looked so bad!)\n\nAnd then Doom shows up, and he has a really cool scene where he kills everybody with his mind, and the lighting gets all moody and shit, and then he's talking about the end of the world, and then there's a black hole killing everyone in Sweden or wherever the fuck, and then they go back to the Eighth Dimension, and they fight for 5 seconds, and Reed loses the scrunchies on his costume, and Doom blows up... and it's over. \n\n**What?!! What the fuck was that?!!** Where was that moody shot of Johnny flaming on at the end of the hallway? Where was the part where the Thing jumped out of the plane? What about that part where Doom talked to Reed about \"the answers\"? And, most importantly, where was the original end of the movie? The entire fight scene has Kate Mara in a wig, so you know that entire thing was re-shot as well. What was Doom's plan? Where did the black hole come from? I'm assuming that that was supposed to be developing the whole time they were in the facility, and that Doom was just exploiting it. But then Reed's like, \"He held the portal open too long, it's gonna kill everybody!\" WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON, I JUST WANT TO SEE A MAN STRETCH AND GO ON FIRE AND A ROCK-MAN TO PUNCH PEOPLE?!! \n\nI'm willing to bet that they cut a good half-hour, an hour at the most, from this movie. That's the only explanation. They chopped it to shit and tried to act like no one would notice. There were hints of a character arc for Reed Richards. The part where he pulls himself back together seems like it was supposed to show that he was going to take responsibility for his actions, which would've worked better if we had seen him constantly shirking his duties. And Ben had no resolution! He says, \"I'm not your friend,\" and that's heartbreaking! Then, typically, they did nothing with it! They never make up, Reed doesn't try to help cure him, they just gloss over it at the end when they're all buddy-buddy again.\n\nWorst of all, though, we never see them come together as a team. Sure, they work together, but that's just because they're trying to end the movie as quickly as possible. We never see them training together, or forming relationships post-accident, or anything! They go from hating each other to working in perfect tandem. Hell, they don't team up until the last 5 minutes of the movie! That'd be like if the Avengers didn't meet each other at all until the scene in Central Park!\n\nThere were glimmers of a good movie trying to get out, but somebody must've thought a shit-show was a better way to go. What a waste, especially for all the actors. Everyone acts their asses off, but their performances all get ADR'd and reshot to Hell, and half of their motivations don't make sense. The plot starts out great, and then falls into incoherence once we hit the halfway mark. I weep for Josh Trank, since he's getting all the blame when it's really Fox's fault.

The Fantastic Four is a super hero family. The team needed to bond and get along. A great example of a Fantastic Four movie is the Incredibles. It's a movie about a super hero family. You can tell they're a family. They argue and bicker, sure. But they come back for one another, act as a shoulder to lean on for the other, and generally try their hardest for each other. More importantly, it shows that a Fantastic Four movie can be done. \n\nSo, since we proved a Fantastic Four movie can be done, let's see what makes a Fantastic Four product. Heart = You appeal to the family and bring them together. \n\nReed Richards(Mr. Fantastic) is the father of the group. He lapses into studying things and kind of loses sight of a problem, but he'll still be there for his family. He's a humanitarian and wants to help people.\n\nSusan Storm(Invisible Woman) is the mother of the group. She keeps the team together and focused. She doesn't allow her family to give up on themselves and want to see the best in them. You might say that she falls into a stereotype, but she's smart in her own right. Reed not only loves her, but respects her as well. The whole team loves and respects her.\n\nJohnny Storm(The Human Torch) is a cocky, smug, guy. But he's the passion of the team. He goes in guns blazing, but he does care about the team. He'll work hard to help his friends. \n\nBen Grimm(The Thing) was an amazing high school athlete, successful student, pilot, and astronaut. He grew up on Yancy Street and became involved in gang life. But he got out of it with the help of his uncle and became a success. He's eccentric, friendly, powerful, and tough. While he can rush into things, he's by no means a rage monster. He's got his own opinions on things, and works hard for his team. And he believes Reed will find a cure for his condition. \n\nThese guys have hopes, dreams, beliefs, and love that they share with each other. So, we have a super team now. Let's see what their element is. \n\nTypically, these guys are discovering different things. So it'd be good to have them investigating something. Rather than an origin story, a movie should be about them going to the center of the Earth, or discovering the Negative Zone. Or facing off against Namor, the Sub Mariner. Have a threat that they can combat but also learn about. Reed would try to learn about Namor as much as possible, while Ben and Johnny should go on the attack. Sue would try to maintain a balance, but would struggle. It would not be until trouble came that the family put aside their squabbling, and face the problem head on. Namor is defeated, there's a mystery about life under the sea, and the movie ends but with possibilities. And if you really wanted to sequel bait, just have Doctor Doom observing the whole thing while he's in his palace. \n\nThis movie missed a lot of opportunities to become something better than just a mindless sci fi movie.

It's a film without a focus, and at times I felt like I was watching a feature length television pilot rather than a complete movie.

Let this movie rot, and pray the rights revert back to Marvel who might just give this franchise a small chance", "NOTE:  I'm totally stealing this synopsis from a post on another website but it's so good it's worth being reposted here:\n\n\n    Here are the notes I made throughout the movie. I'm not going to spoiler the spoilers, because quite frankly, it's not worth it, this movie is shit and nobody should watch it- also I'm lazy.\n\n    - I'm going to ask you to imagine a movie made in the 80's where the main guy is a smart dude that gets no recognition. You probably imagined a really bad scene where the main guy, as a kid, does something REALLY smart that gets no recognition from his classmates, except for that one kid who's gonna be his friend. That is literally what happens, played straight all the way through.\n\n    - The teacher character is dumb. I'm not saying '80's movie dumb' because this movie tries to be a little bit realistic, which makes this guy full on idiotic. Here's kid Reed, probably around ten years old, talking about supercomputers and things that are real in 2007- not 1988, this is 2007, right before the iPhone- and the guy tells him \"you were supposed to make a presentation about a real job from the real world\". Okay, guy is forgiven, he's just dumb. But nope. Cut to seven years later, teenager Reed LITERALLY INVENTS TELEPORTATION and the guy says, no joke, no paraphrasing, this is an actual line spoken by a character, \"this is a science fair, I'm not seeing any science here, this is magic\".\n\n    - The kid actors are awful. The kid playing Reed has this monotone way of speaking and way of looking that makes him look like a lost fish. Miles Teller does that too.\n\n    - Tim Heidecker of Tim and Eric is Reed's dad. Appears for one scene and does nothing apart from coomplain that Reed's experiment.\n\n    - Reports that \"it's clobberin' time\" is Ben's bully brother's catchphrase are true. But the problem is that this is used once and never comes back around. There's no arc built around Ben having emotional abuse. In fact, Ben's brother is cut off before he can really start slapping around by Ben's mother. It's as out of place here as every other actual thing from the comic.\n\n    - It's at this point I realized something. The characters in this movie can speak two kinds of dialog. It's either a. painfully stating their or other character's characteristics (\"Reed's the brains here\" or \"I thought you grew up Johnny\") or b. spouting exposition to further the plot (I genuinely think that in the first fifteen minutes they only talk in exposition speak or to show just how nerdy Reed is).\n\n    - Let's get back to Miles Teller. His performance is awful. He speaks only in a single tone, barely registers above 'confused' and his eyes are always stuck in 'netural acting mode'. But, oh, he's not the worst. No, because this is when we're introduced to Kate Mara's Sue Storm. For starters, she gets her 'character establishing moment' on a library which stinks of a rom-com meet cute (it is) and if Teller is giving no fucks, Kate Mara is literally in another dimension, practically dead. Her face probably has two settings: \"acting\" and \"strained look for the CGI\".\n\n    - In her first section of dialog, she talks about how she identifies patterns. So you think \"what an interesting quirk\", right? Nope. It's for furthering the plot later on. None of the characters have things they do, they just have things the plot could use later on.\n\n    - Victor Von Doom is perhaps the WORST adaptation of a comic book character. For starters, its clear that wasn't his name when the movie was being shot. Everytime the characters say \"Victor Von Doom\" you can see the ADR changing the name. By the way, the ADR is awful. There is a part where they're wearing masks and the mask move to show they're talking. Victor's mask moves seventy times and he says two lines.\n\n    - How is Victor Von Doom, the Marvel Universe's greatest villain introduced? As a neckbeard. I shit you not, he has a neckbeard, long hair, is playing videogames and is in a dark house. By the way, let's talk about Doom's character: he's anti-government. That is it. I swear to God I wish there was something more, but like with all character arcs, they start by hinting out that there's a genius behind all that pain but give up and go back to one line descriptions of characters. Thankfully he washes up and goes to the lab.\n\n    - It's at this point, 20-25 minutes into the movie, that I realized two people in the front row were fast asleep, snoring loudly.\n\n    - Sue Storm, one of comics' most important women, is given nothing to do in this movie. I'm not joking here. She doesn't even go into the negative zone in the first place. Her main actions in this movie can be boiled down to three things. Actually, that's the same for all characters minus Reed. Until the final battle, pretty much everyone does absolutely nothing. Nothing happens. Nothing happens.\n\n    - Doom's accent comes on and off.\n\n    - And now, a line from a movie made in 2015:\n    Doom: \"Have you seen what the leaders of this world are doing to it?\"\n    Sue: \"Check out Doctor Doom here.\"\n\n    - More characters talking about how other characters are this or that.\n\n    - Johnny Storm is introduced in a street car race, which is screenwriting lingo for 'is a rebel'. Again, like exactly all of the other character arcs, this is made out to be a really big thing for the character and is promptly ignored before being solved with two lines of dialog. Nothing happens and everything is fixed in two lines.\n\n    - Michael B. Jordan is the only one giving a fuck and his performance warrants the two genuine laughs I had in this movie. Poor guy.\n", "\"Reed, I think you've cracked interdimensional travel!  We've been able to send things away to other dimensions, but never bring them back.  Except for this vile of sand that we somehow have, and was just in my pocket as I inexplicably browse a high school science fair for no discernable reason.\"", "This movie was exactly like the trailer,generic.", "cool will add this movie to my 'to pirate' list", "I didn't think the film was terrible.  It wasn't good, but it wasn't terrible.\n\nI write this as a comic book fan who has never been fond of the Fantastic Four.  So I was able to watch *Fant4stic* with a detachment that I figure Fantastic Four fans wouldn't have.  \n\nHere's a list of the things that I thought stuck out the most:\n\n**This movie will piss off Fantastic Four fans**\n\nReed comes across as an irresponsible child.  They butcher the Doom character.  There's very little sign of that family bond that's at the core of the FF characters.  The movie has none of the cosmic wonder that helped make the Fantastic Four popular to begin with.\n\nThis was clearly a movie made by someone who wanted to put an entirely new spin on a set of established characters.  Do you remember the Godzilla movie directed by Roland Emmerich?  That dude was arrogant enough to completely reimagine Godzilla.  We all know how hated that movie was.  I figure that this film - which like *Godzilla* paid little-to-no respect to the source material - will piss off comic book fans as much as Emmerich's abomination pissed off Japanese kaiju fans.\n\n**The Prometheus Problem**\n\nWhen *Prometheus* came out, one of the biggest complaints was how irrational and downdright stupid the scientist characters were. The dude responsible for mapping out the entire alien facility got lost.  The world-class biologist decided to treat a highly dangerous alien lifeform like a poodle.  So on and so forth.\n\n*Fant4stic* suffers from the same issue that *Prometheus* did.  Reed, Victor, Sue, even Johnny were supposed to be among the brightest young minds in that world.  But once they got their dimensional transporter up and running, Reed, Victor, and Johnny went full retard.\n\nTravel to a completely uncharted dimension that's probably filled with danger, without any survival training whatsoever?  Sure.  Operatre the device capable of destroying the planet without any supervision or backup?  Why not?  Walk up close to the unknown energy source without first trying to analyze it from afar?  Fuck yeah!\n\nIf people were pissed off by how irrational and careless the scientsts from *Prometheus* were, they're really going to lose their shit when they see the nonsense Reed and his Wonder Bunch pull off.\n\n**Ass Backwards**\n\nThe film manages to do something I can't recall any other superhero film doing: the best part was when nobody had any superpowers.  Once the VFX started to really pop up, the movie got silly and boring.\n\nI actually liked the first act of the film.  The audience I watched it with laughed several times during the first 45 minutes or so.  The characters were pretty engaging and likable at first.  The beginning of the movie was a slower burner, sure, but it had the makings of an interesting sci-fi film.\n\nBut starting with the group's drunken foray into Dimension Zero, the movie fell apart.  Character motivations stopped making sense. The jumps from scene to scene began to feel rushed.  The action felt flat.  \n\nThe first act had hints that the film makers probably wanted it to be slow-burning sci-fi from beginning to end.  I wouldn't be surprised if Trank, the editors, or whomever were pressured by the studio to make the movie more like *The Avengers*: more action-packed, more effects-driven, to at least end with a huge battle scene.  \n\nWhatever happened behind the scenes, the end result was a movie that started off as interesting sci-fi, but ended with superhero action that felt forced or half-assed. \n\n**Final Note**\n\nMy buddy and I cracked up at some unintentionally hilarious scenes.\n\nFranklin Storm's death = hilarious!  His death scene had no weight to it what-so-ever.  His kids apparently forgot that their dad died a few minutes after it happened.\n\nReed's fight against Doom = comedy gold!  Doom was able to easily deflect the Thing, Human Torch, and Invisible Woman, but Stretch Armstrong punching him in the face worked like a charm.\n\nNo Stan Lee.

You have 4 really good actors, but so many of the scenes are awkward (not trying to be funny awkward, just awkward) and it made me find Human Torch a whiny teenager, not cool.

They're all 17-20, with Doom being 10 years older but totally into Sue, and has been into her, which is creepy.\n\nReed is a shitty friend to Ben.

The final battle only 5 minutes long and actually fucking ended.  Just ended.  Doom was easy to beat.  But I guess crash test dummies who can explode heads with his mind is easily taken out by 4 teenagers without an attempt to blow up their heads.\n\nAt least the VFX were good, but a lot of money can make great VFX.\n\nThis review is all over the place, just like that movie.  What a shit show.", "I really, really wanted this to surprise everyone and be good. I like Trank, I love the cast, and I was so annoyed by the fact that most people online just immediately decided it was terrible before we even saw a poster for it that I ended up weirdly rooting for the movie. \n\nThat said, it's bad. It's very, very bad. Not as bad as the other FF movies from the mid-00's, but still bad. It's pretty late and I'm tired as all hell so I'm just going to format my thoughts in bullet points.\n\nPros:\n\n* First act is actually really good. There's a lot of nice character moments and I genuinely ended up liking a lot of them, especially liked the dynamic between Reed and Ben (Jamie Bell gives a really endearing performance); it starts off as a really likable hangout movie and I kinda dug that. It also has this cool 80s Spielberg/Cronenberg vibe that was pretty refreshing for a superhero movie, and based on comments Trank made a while back about how that was his vision for the movie, I can only assume the first half of the movie is mostly him. If the movie stuck with this style all the way through it could have actually been a very refreshing comic book movie.\n\n* As I said, Josh Trank mentioned a while back that he was heavily inspired by David Cronenberg and wanted to create an 80s body horror vibe for some of the scenes after they get their powers; these scenes are pretty dope and I really wish the second half of the movie stuck with that tone (instead it's only really present for a few sequences).\n\n* The main cast all give really good performances, especially Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell. They give their characters sincerity and manage to keep their dignity through some terrible dialogue. Hell, even though Doom is extremely underwritten, Toby Kebbel does the best he can with him and has some pretty likable moments (specifically the scene where he, Reed, and Johnny are all drinking together). All in all the main cast from this movie does a much, much better job than the main cast from the 2005 movie.\n\n* Loved the sequence where Doom escapes and first uses his powers. It was the only part of the second half of this movie that's really memorable and isn't aggressively lazy & safe; was not expecting it to get that dark, and it's really well shot. At times it feels like something out of Scanners.\n\nCons:\n\n* Tonally speaking, the movie is all over the place. You have a really good first act, and then after that there are scenes of super cheesy & cliche'd dialogue and lazy humor (which comprises a majority of the second half), cobbled together with these scenes that are extremely dark and seem like they're from an 80s Cronenberg movie (specifically the sequence with Doom using his powers). It honestly feels like they took scenes from two completely different movies and cut them together to create a third. This is a really, really weird movie.\n\n* Acting from pretty much all of the supporting cast is pretty bad, across the board.\n\n* Despite that one dope sequence, Doom is completely wasted as a villain and his whole evil plan is incredibly half-assed, as are his motivations.\n\n* The most rushed climax I've ever seen in a superhero movie.\n\n* WAY too short. This movie was like 90s minutes, and that definitely contributes to how rushed the second half is. You spend Act 1 with decent pacing and getting to know these characters, and then everything after that just felt like \"Superhero Movies: The Cliff Notes\".\n\nOverall this was kind of a disaster. Again, I actually really feel bad for Trank (please keep in mind that the rumors about him on the internet aren't credible at all and pretty much all come from anonymous messageboards; I guarantee that if the same rumors were spread about, say, the Russo Brothers, people wouldn't have immediately believed them like this). The guy's actually a pretty promising filmmaker and this movie was a waste of his, and everyone's, time. He recently tweeted that the final version was extremely neutered and not what his original vision for the movie was, and to be honest I believe him; it explains the jarring tone, plus there are actually some really nice moments and promising ideas that are completely muddled by almost offensive laziness. Also, I realize that due to the rumors about him and the overall horrible nature of this movie, that he's an easy target, but he shouldn't get *all* the blame. Keep in mind that film is an intensely collaborative medium, and often times studios will pick young directors like him because they can control them easier than more seasoned directors (same thing with getting Marc Webb for Spider-Man, and Colin Trevorrow for Jurassic World). As a result, Trank really didn't have much of a say about how the finished product will turn out. I'm not saying \"don't criticize Trank's direction\" because certainly some of the blame goes to him; I'm saying that we shouldn't focus all the blame on him, Simon Kinberg and the studio itself are equally (if not more) at fault.\n\nTL;DR this movie was a waste of time and talent, both in front of & behind the camera. First half is really good, but the minute they get their powers the movie turns into a generic tonally inconsistent mess. I'll also be more than happy to expand on some of my statements, if anyone wants more specifics. \n\nEDIT: Spelling and redundancies ", "You know, I actually wanted to see this movie. Despite what the Internet was saying, I kind of blocked the noise out so I could be level headed about the film. Unfortunately, having good feelings about a movie doesn't guarantee a good movie, and boy was this movie bad.\n\nI think everyone will talk about what exactly is awful (boring, unrewarding payoff, CGI, etc.), but I'm just as disappointed about the advertising. The scene where the Thing drops from the helicopter onto a tank doesn't even happen. WTF?", "Guys please don't pay money to see this crap.. Fox deserves to be in the red for ruining franchises they refuse to sell back to Marvel.", "Methinks Zoe Barnes would rather lie under that subway track than be the only (seriously ONLY) female character in this film.", "I liked it, but I'm weird like that I guess.\n\nThe cast is great. The acting is fine. I really felt for the Thing more than once, but wish they developed his and Reed's friendship a more. Much of the characters could have been more developed, specifically their relationships. I really wish they had developed the friendships and connections between the characters *more*. The final scene was actually my favorite, the team was finally the team we've been waiting for. I can forgive the film for lacking that sort of chemistry because it's an origin film, but I wanted it to keep going from there. \n\nIt's got some pacing issues that have been addressed, but I didn't find it 9% RT bad. I like what they've built to be honest, and wouldn't mind a sequel.

I find that hilarous given that since he was cast EVERYONE has ragged on how he's horrible for the role\n\n* **Dr Doom** has been horribly written again for the third time in 10 years. it's very clear that nobody understands this incredibly complex character that has the ability to be more memorable than thanos loki or any incarnation of lex luthor.\n\n* **Kate Mara**  is wooden beyond belief and only serves as a means to advance the plot... she has absolutely 0 character or character development.\n\n* **Mr Fantastic** he uses his powers like 3 times in the movie and uses them the same exact way each time. The first 20 minutes of the movie with his relationship with ben is where the story has a little bit of soul but when he decides to become bruce banner  and become some sort of scientific drifter living in a 3rd world country his character takes a nose dive.\n\n* **The Thing** is impressive... sorta but he never comes into his character of being likeable he's just kinda there and barely has any interaction with  Johnny except for like one line at the end.\n\nThis is an incomplete movie. the pacing and storytelling starts out trying to do something. then it completely forgets what happened to get there once they reach the halfway point.\n\nI know this won't flop but I do hope that fox maybe takes a long look before doing another fantastic four movie..

Fox please give up.\n", "So where are all the people vehemently defending this movie as the best thing since sliced bread?\n\nThe same people who were claiming that everyone that thought it looked bad were closet racists or some shit?\n\nWhere are you people now?", "Let me start off by saying that I wasn't the biggest fan of Chronicle. I overall hate found footage films, and personally I felt that Chronicle was overrated. When it was announced that Trank would helm the Fantastic Four reboot, I was skeptical but was still trusting in the director's ability to pull off a good movie, despite having very little work under his belt.\n\n\nThe first half was good, in my opinion. I went in with low expectations and at first I was surprised by how much I was enjoying it. In fact, sometime during the first act I leaned over to my friend and whispered \"I think critics were being a little too harsh.\" I liked that they explored how intelligent Reed actually is, something that is obvious in the comics but isn't too developed in the previous films. Also, being a big Simpson's fan, I got a little kick out of seeing Dan Castelleneta on the big screen. However, once they actually got their powers, the film took a total nosedive.\n\n\nThe actual way the Four get their powers felt a little wonky. Ben getting hit with a bunch of rocks and Johnny just bursting into flames had me laughing out loud. It felt like something out of an episode of Jimmy Neutron. The random \"One year later\" time skip felt really out of place, the dialogue was ill-written, and despite what people say, I oftentimes found the acting wooden.\n\n\nBesides Sue being able to fly with her force field bubble, there was nothing new done with the powers. Mr. Fantastic's stretchiness felt extremely underused, except for the scene where he alters his face to look like someone else. \n\n\nThe tone changed almost every 10 minutes, starting first as a sort of feel good science movie, then horror, then just random BS.\n\n\nDoom reappears with only about 15-20 minutes left in the film. When the four antagonists face off against him, you don't really get a sense that it's the final battle and it's over relatively quickly. There wasn't enough examples of the team working together to fight him too, in my opinion.\n\n\nAlso, my biggest pet peeve has got to be Sue's ever-changing hair. In one scene, she'll have her brownish hair with blonde highlights. In the next scene, she'll be wearing an obvious all-white wig. This is definitely a product of reshoots, which have been a big point of criticism during the film's production.\n\n\nOverall, the movie was a massive disappointment. I'm a big Marvel fanboy, but I still wanted to have a decent Fantastic Four movie be made. What started out as something fun turned into complete garbage. I definitely don't recommend this for anyone.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Also, Doom looked like a crash test dummy with LED lights for eyes.", "This movie, was terrible. felt rushed, and incomplete. Marvel would have done a better job with the characters.

Reboots in general have a pretty poor stigma, especially when they aren't too far removed from the last attempt. Early on, there was news/rumors about re-shoots which now seem to be confirmed. The entire advertising wing was god awful, its like they didn't know how to market this film despite the fact that it *should* -- in theory -- be able to sell itself. A new FF from the guy who did Chronicle? On paper, that sounds great. \n\nThen the review embargo came down. Not very reassuring. Then Miles Teller essentially [begged](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33750796/fantastic-four-cast-havent-seen-the-final-film-yet---and-its-out-in-a-few-days) fans to give the movie a shot.

The *powers* are boring.\n\nHow could the first few trailers be so misleading?  I wanted to see Johnny and Sue flying with their powers on an alien world battling something.  Instead, a set piece a 5 year old invents with their action figures is the climax.\n\nIt didn't have to be.  Ultimate Fantastic Four provides a perfect set of scenes to build the characters.  Sure Doom has to be in the movie because Doom's powers originate in the same way.  But why couldn't the planet he was left behind on have been ruled by Annihulus?  Then he and Reed and company ally to dethrone him.  Now that would be awesome.\n\nShow me the Thing beating the shit out of giant aliens.  Show me Johnny Storm going supernova.  Show me Reed Richards stretching for miles.  Show me Sue Storm levitating massive objects and creatively making things invisible to defeat adversaries.  Show me Doom being fucking **Dr Doom**\n\nThe music in this movie sucked.\n\nBad", "I rather sit through 10 screenings of Ghost Rider than watch this filth of a movie unfortunately having the Marvel brand on it. As a Marvel fan I was really, really disappointed. ", "While it appears that Fox takes the big L for this one, it is worth reflecting upon the effects of modern fandom on productions.\n\nTwo trends in opinion have been popping up in relation to the superhero genre, both of which appear determined by the popularity of the \"Marvel Cinematic Universe\". The first is faithfulness to the source material. It started with the ridiculous racial casting debate, which I believe most found asinine. But the general sentiment that spawned from the transformation of Doom was the first thing that generated production conflict. If the fan's need to dictate the shape of a film impede on auteurial cohesion then maybe fans need to shut up. Production studios are often immensely stupid and lumbering capitalist institutions. They will slaughter your good intentions.\n\nThe second trend relates to a general backlash against two aesthetic trends of the mid-2000s early teens. Those being realism and pessimism. The general nihilism and pessimism that followed the Bush years led to a range of both superficially realistic (handheld camera, cold blue color palettes, hyper violence, ennui and self-loathing, etc.) and narratively pessimistic films. At the beginning this trend was challenging and new, but as time when on and style became cliche and the aesthetic became a shorthand promoting laziness, people backlashed against works appearing in this direction (Batman v Superman, True Detective Season 2, appear casualties of this sentiment, though the former may still surprise its detractors, while the latter must wait until its inevitable boxset reappraisal). In both cases the lack of trust in the creative vision of a director, on the grounds of principles and generality rather than evidence likely played a part in this film being hacked apart.\n\nWe do not need all superhero films to look and act like Marvel films. Seriousness can be an effective means of exploring fantastic worlds (films like Blade Runner and Alien, the Nolan Batman films, Tarkovsky's Stalker and Solaris, Cronenberg's body horror films--Dead Ringers, Videodrome, The Fly, Existenz, Scanners--, Primer, Timecrimes, 2001, Interstellar and Inception, the first Matrix movie and even Snyder's Watchmen, for instance).\n\nSuperhero has ceased to be a genre and has rather become a subject, just like police are in noir action, thrillers, comedies and so on. If we do not embrace this fact we will end up with one style that I would argue has ceased to challenge--for instance, Iron Man 3, Age of Ultron, and Thor 2, while entertaining hardly reached above popcorn flicks for the whole family. My hope is that Batman v Superman will bridge the excellent action of the first Man of Steel and Snyder's general excellent aesthetics, with Nolan's tight productions while benefiting from a better scriptwriter. This should open up possibilities going forward. But if certain media outlets and fans have their way, this film would be recut as a silverage Reeves meets Adam West romp through alternate dimensions, because that is positive and not 'grimdark', which is, you know, inherently bad.", "This is a rant..I apologize...I'm a little mad..\n\n\nWhat the actual fuck was that? ARE THEY SERIOUS...THATS IT...It started out great and then it fucking shitted all over itself, Where's the character development between Sue and Reed, where is that family relationship between the Storms..Hell why the fuck did Ben forgive Reed in 5 minutes...WHAT THE FUCK, I though all three hated Reed and now they're all buddy buddies again? and Oh My God...We get a great Villain in Doom, a villain who actually seem menacing and like an actual threat and they beat him in 5 minutes...I kid you not....5 minutes. count it.\n\nAnd at the end they laugh about the name...really...really...my god what a fucking Train wreck...

In particular the scene when they get back from the other dimensions and Miles is crawling to Jamie, and also the scene where Dr. Doom escapes down some corridors and murders people with their brain matter splattering on the walls behind them.\n\nWhat I didnt like was most of the dialogue, the fact that the reason the smartest people in the world who just solved inter-dimensional travel use it is because they were drinking, and the one year time jump skipped over what could have been an interesting part (them finding their powers. I also thought the cgi wasn't great (the infamous shot of the tank head disappearing is in the final movie) and the first ten minutes with the child actors was really bad. \n\nI would see a sequel.

We cracked interdimensional travel when we were 10, what's up?\"\n\nEnds even shittier -- Doom has negative motivation. The movie COMPLETELY disintegrates the moment Doom kills Franklin Storm and jumps back into the other dimension.\n\nMostly everything in between the prologuey childhood stuff and the last 15 minutes or so is actually pretty good. The cast is SO FUCKING GOOD. I hate that they're in such a subpar movie.\n\nI cannot believe that Sue didn't go with everyone to the other dimension the first time. Kate Mara has absolutely nothing to do throughout the entire movie except look ridiculous floating around in her hamster bubble.\n\nSo many missed opportunities, the most egregious being that they do absolutely nothing with the Storm family. I couldn't care less what race these characters are; in fact, I thought it was gonna be awesome to see a mixed-race, adoptive family depicted in a summer blockbuster...but the Storms don't even seem like a family. The film itself really lends credence to the idea that Michael B. Jordan was cast to stir controversy. Super lame.\n\nWhen the dialogue wasn't paint-by-numbers cliche, it was astoundingly terrible. When Reed finds out that Sue is adopted, he tells her he knows how she feels and says, \"No, I wasn't adopted. But I always wanted to be.\" What the fuck?\n\nTHE VISUAL EFFECTS. What the absolute hell. The green pool from the other dimension looked like it was ripped from the Dimension of Perpetual 1995, the drones Johnny shoots down are laughable, and Kate Mara looks ridiiiiiiculous any time she uses her bubble shield.\n\nGive Doom some motivation, integrate the characters better (Ben ultimately feels very tacked on, in terms of the group dynamic), better CGI, BETTER DIALOGUE (seriously what the fuck, Simon Kinberg?) and this could have been a damn good movie.\n\nAs a final note, I didn't find Doom's appearance to be so offensive. I actually think that Doom looked kind of awesome. I understand he's such a divergence from the comics that he's not even the same character, but I appreciated him for what he was. My favorite part of the film was Doom's escape from the facility and the code red.\n\n4/10.", "The Fantastic Four deserve so much better.

But it wasn't anything impressive, innovative or exciting to me. It felt like a story that actually could've benefited from a series length of a story arc to play out more fully. It was too compact and a lot was lost in translation. The ending also felt very flat and made me shake my head disappointingly. But it still deter it from being above all else \"a good Dragonball movie\". Also with every new form introduced I can't help but feel its just utterly unnecessary.\n\nHopefully at the very least it lets the new generation of kids who haven't been exposed to DBZ yet get excited about the series and tune into the new series Dragonball Super so it can keep living on. Its one anime franchise I truly do believe deserves to get more material as time goes on in small increments for each generation of kids to experience. It also helps it seems so far from the few episodes of DB Super that have aired in Japan that \"Battle of Gods\" and \"Resurrection F\" will be covered in actual story arcs in the series before moving into the new material/stories we've been promised from it.

My favorite part of Resurrection F was that Tien, Krillin, and Master Roshi being more than punching bags for the henchmen. Master Roshi in particular since DragonBall fans haven't seen him fight since Goku was a kid.

The comedy is still there, but it's less campy and goofy and more action oriented. \n\nSomething that bugged me about the film was the integration of CG during fights. Their animations seemed just a hair slower than the animations of hand drawn action. I'm not sure if that was intentional to make the fights more dramatic.

I remember a lot of the action in BoG like when Beerus and Goku fight in the cave, or when , or when Goku and Beerus run toward each other in the rocky desert then fight, or when Goku fights Beerus in outer space etc. In Resurrection F I only clearly remember Jaco and Vegeta's fight scenes and this one scene where Goku is dodging Frieza's red blasts, which looks really good. Besides those 3 scenes I felt the choreography was pretty generic. Goku and Frieza throw a flurry of punches/kicks at each other, then cut to the sky with a bunch of shockwaves\n\n*Music in BoG was waaaaay better. There was an actual orchestra and a composer. As mentioned before I felt like Resurrection F was missing music in scenes and I was not a fan of the J-metal\n\n*I don't feel like there were any \"moments\" that gave you chills like in BoG. For example in BoG there was that one \"moment\" where Vegeta beets up Beerus for hitting Bulma. That \"moment\" where Goku goes SSG. That \"moment\" where Goku goes berserk in the cave. I feel like the \"moment\" we have in Resurrection F is when Vegeta goes SSG and is about to kill Frieza, but that get's ruined when Goku ends up saving the day.\n\n**TL;DR Just watch BoG and Resurrection F, and Super becuase DBZ is forever.**", "HD Dragonball might be the greatest thing to ever exist.

It was really refreshing how they relied on suspense rather than huge action scenes. It was actually impressive how they restrained themselves instead of going bigger and bigger like most blockbusters these days. Some of the scenes, especially the ones between Ilsa and Ethan were very Hitchcockian, or at least reminded me a lot of Hitchcock's films.\n\nI also like the almost cartoonish way they captured the villain. They literally set up a trap for him and locked him away in a box. That was awesome.\n\nAll in all, it's my second favourite Mission Impossible film. I didn't have any expectations with Christopher McQuarrie as the director (I haven't seen Jack Reacher) but he did a really great job.

I've only seen 3 and 4 before it, and this was probably my second favorite out of the three, behind Ghost Protocol.

I also found the plot really interesting, although the pace and story did seem to slow down a bit in the third act. All in all, very solid action flick. I'll most likely wind up seeing it again before it leaves theaters.", "Loved the movie. Had a great Bond feel to it. Only thing that bothered me was how little concern I had for the Syndicate really being a threat. I know Ethan told Benji what they had done in the world but we never saw any of that.

I swore that if Tom Cruise is going to strap himself to a taking off plane for our entertainment then this film deserves my 10 bucks. (Fuuuuuck That noise! Id say CGI me in that bitch) But the rest of it was very good. Great set pieces from the Opera sequence to the whole car and motorbike chase. Some scenes they out Bonded Bond. Cruise's little ticks reacting to the cast were very funny and glad Simon Pegg got a huge chunk of screen time. I dont know how they did it but Cruise and/or stuntman riding at high speeds on the bike without a helmet looked just as dangerous as the plane ride. If I have one complaint is I kinda felt the ending was a dash anti-climatic but still satisfying in its way. All in all a very very good action flick. Your move Spectre. I loved MI:4 and not sure if this one is better but for right now I think its equal ", "I dunno. Overall, pretty good movie, but the pacing overall is quite slow. It definitely dragged a lot compared to ghost protocol which moved at a brisk pace. And while the action was great, the characters were a bit dull. It didn't really capture anybody's personality very well and made them all rather 2 dimensional. And the stakes felt low considering the premise. All in all I was a little disappointed, but maybe the 90~% rating on rottentomatoes just overhyped it for me. ", "Unpopular opinion alert, I guess: I was really disappointed.\n\nI loved MI:GP.  One of the best IMAX experiences I've ever had.  Fun, ambitious set pieces, confident directing, great dynamic between characters, just the right amount of humor.  It was what *I* think a M:I film should be: fun, with an emphasis on action set pieces, clearly not a 007 attempt.\n\nMI:RN just wasn't fun for me.  The opera set piece was extremely well done, but everything after that was messy.  I think the opera set piece established location tremendously well and used that to its advantage.  It set such a high standard.  And then every set piece from there, minus the dive, felt so generic to me.  No real sense of place, or stake, or environment.  Just action set pieces that could have been lifted from any action film.\n\nRenner and Rhames felt like total throwaways to me in this one.  It was all Cruise/Pegg/Ferguson basically, and I just didn't find their dynamic nearly as fun as the contingent in GP.  Pegg is starting to get a bit over-obvious in these roles, I think, but that might just be a \"my perception\" issue.\n\nDidn't care for the villain.  Found the set pieces lacking in comparison to many of the better installments in the rest of the series.  Didn't have that much fun.  I thought this tried too hard to be a 007 film, basically, when this series is much better off on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nIn short, though: I thought this film badly missed Brad Bird.", "You know the plane sequence from the Trailer, they put that right in the beginning. Amazing.\n\nThe movie does something I think Mad Max, James Bond and the rest of the Missions Impossible does well. It is an action movie with great pacing. The change in scenery from Austria to Morocco to England, mixed with shots from Langley is fluid and well done. It didn't feel stuffed and too long. It felt expansive and it made what they did important. It was more like Ghost Protocol than the others in its filming and comedy but that is a plus in my books.\n\nLuther is in it, though I wished there was more of him. Maybe I just miss the character so much. Benji is more funny and in this he isn't just a punching bag, he is important. Alec Baldwin's character, though his screen time is limited and at times sticks to the American-executive-tough-guy thing too much, was good. Also Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust was amazing, really great chemistry with Ethan. \n\nThe villain was the best since MI:3. He was creepy more than scary. My only issue is that his reasoning for what he did, while more compelling than previous MI villains needed more screentime. I wanted to see him explain it with more detail. Bring the audience on his side, a Stockholm syndrome type effect that you see in any other action villain. \n\nThe car chases are amazing and the added motorcycle chase in Morocco is really cool. Definitely millions of BMWs in the movie. Being a BMW car enthusiast I didn't mind it. The motorcycle chase was filmed incredibly well and one of the few motorcycle chase scenes I have ever seen filmed that way. Along with that their fight scenes were the usual. In my opinion not as good as Ghost Protocol but the general action was set up much better, especially an early scene in a theatre and a later scene in London. \n\nIf you expect another death defying Ethan Hunt extravaganza then you might if you searched find some. The plane scene from the trailer is not the craziest thing Ethan did. The craziest was the opposite direction and constricting if you know what I mean. But its a well made movie with a good villain, side characters, plot and action. Mission Impossible is grown up but also has fun. When does MI:6 come out?\n\nedit: not sure if Kingsman or Rogue Nation is my favourite espionage movie and Man From Uncle is coming up. ", "I feel like I saw a different movie to the critics and most people posting. It was OK but the plot was ridiculously generic and the villain sucked. What happened to that single take underwater scene Tom Cruise kept talking about?\n\nTwo good action scenes (Vienna and the bike chase) but I really hoped for more than a 6/10. Kinda feel like having a strong female character is undermined somewhat by some of the lecherous camera shots.\n\nThird act was a trainwreck, no epic set-piece and clearly a mess they tried to salvage in reshoots.\n\nFor me the MI series goes 4 >>>>> 1 >>> 5 > 3 > 2", "Was quite underwhelmed to be honest. The stakes felt really low for some reason, and the film lacked any urgency because of it. Overall was just sort of dull.\n\nAlso some *very* dodgy cgi in that car chase", "It was just ok.

", "Hands down the second best action blockbuster this summer.", "This may be harsh and an unpopular opinion, but Rogue Nation was easily one of the worst movies I've seen this year.\n\n\nThe writing was bland, a lot of dialogue was absolutely cringe-worthy, and humor was constantly interrupting the narrative - no room for any thrills to grow here. Stunt scenes were included for the sake of stunt scenes. Villain was one of the most wanna-be-evil, hilariously bad characters ever (his voice, oh my god). This was all weighed down further by McQuarrie's awful direction.\n\n\nAnd the biggest offense: there was literally *zero* suspense or engaging plot in this movie. None. I could've slept through the *whole* thing. Is this seriously what Mission Impossible has become? Another generic summer blockbuster, ripe with over-the-top comic relief and uninspired action/CGI scenes? God. Go back and rewatch MI:1 or MI:3 (or even Ghost Protocol) and see how fun, exciting, and adrenaline-filled these films used to be.\n\nThere were probably two things I actually liked about Rogue Nation: the opera scene was well-shot and pretty cool. Car / motorcycle chase was interesting. But that's pretty much it.\n\n\nOverall, I'm not sure what this movie was trying to be. A lightweight, funny action movie? A serious action block buster? It failed to accomplish either. This was not only a bad MI movie, but a bad movie in general.\n\n\nI'm gonna have to watch Mad Max again to wash the taste out of my mouth.", "All the magic technology really took me out of the film.

Definitely a disappointing cameo, which is a shame because Clark Griswold is pretty great.\n\nEven though there's occasionally some overly stupid jokes that aren't funny, I still found this movie a good entertaining movie that has some big laughs.", "So you're saying I should see Mission Impossible instead tomorrow? Vacatioj has gotten such shitty reviews from critics and moviegoers.", "An these guys are going to write for spider man? lol i see them getting dropped or something changing in the scripts after this shit fest. Given filming has not started yet. ", "I really didn't like this movie. I'll start off by saying the original vacation with Chevy was a fun and enjoyable comedy but this new sequel (if you could call it that) was just not funny. I cringed throughout a majority of the \"edgy\" jokes that often fell flat in the theater. \n     A prime example is when the kids tell their dad that they saw a hole in the bathroom and rusty jumps in to tell them \"I believe you discovered a glory hole\" I'm all for a good glory hole joke, but I'm not gonna laugh just because Rusty Griswolds says the word glory hole. I know what a glory hole is, there has to be a joke there. I'm not in 5th grade. Another is when Kevin says that he wishes his older brother had AIDS. Again, I can laugh at an aids joke if there is an actual fucking joke there!!!! Just having one character telling another character to die of aids isn't funny it's weird and slightly offensive. I'm not just gonna laugh because you said the word aids. The script had so many scenarios like this that were just shamelessly lazy, begging the viewer to laugh at boners, boobs, poop and rim jobs. Apatow and comedians like Louis CK have proven that raunchy humor can be really funny but behind the raunchiness there has to be a clever or well written joke or some bigger picture idea. Vacation dismisses all subtlety. \n     It also suffers from a case of the trailer giving away the best gags. Scenes that last for a minute or longer are ruined because I already know what's going to happen. For example, the hot springs scene where they're actually bathing in sewage the entire time.  I know that it's sewage from the trailer so why drag me through a 5 minute scene of them getting into the sewage when I already know the entire crux of the gag. Same goes for when rusty is flirting with the girl in the red convertible. I know from the trailer that she's going to get in a car crash, so when they drag on that joke for minutes at a time it feels like a wasted joke and a waste of my time. Trainwreck, a much better comedy, changed jokes from the trailer to throw off viewers and avoid this problem. \n     At 2 hours the tired script just repeats itself with predictable gags and whacky shenanigans about as interesting as a wet carrot. \n     As far as performances, Ed helms tries his best to save the movie but I ended up just feeling bad for him. He seems like a good dude who just wants to make a fun movie but was roped into this disaster. Christina applegate looks tired and worn in all her scenes as if she wants to get off the nightmare of a set. This is the same case, for most of the cameos (Charlie Day and Keegan Michael Key being charismatic exceptions) you could tell they just booked the actors for a day of shooting and that they signed on to make a quick buck. Ron Livingston especially. His character is supposed to be the big villain the Griswolds encounter at the climax of the movie but you feel nothing because before that scene, he only gets about 45 seconds of screen time. The writers were too lazy to even develop him as an antagonist and he goes down in a slow motion fight montage, a tired modern comedy cliche that has been played out a million times before. \n\nOverall, I felt nothing but pain in the theater and genuinely laughed about 2 times. I haven't felt this disappointed after watching a comedy since Movie 43. \n\n2/10\n\nEDIT: formatting stuff", "Charlie Day saved this movie for me.

My main criticism would be a lot of actual scenes were used in the trailers, but none of the \"top\" scenes in the movie were so that's a plus. Charlie Day was great, the four corners scene was a highlight and the scenes with Rusty playing wingman to James and the Japanese GPS were pretty great gags. It was a funny and fun enough date movie. Don't expect the original Vacation, though there are plenty of homages. It's 30+ years different and the humor is different, times change.

I know it's stupid and not well made in the slightest but this is probably the most I've laughed in a movie this year besides Trainwreck or Spy. The first ten minutes fell entirely flat for me but once they got the car it pretty much made me laugh nonstop, even if I was laughing at how bad some parts were. \n\nI get the criticisms (maybe besides the family being unsympathetic, I don't think that matters in a movie like this) but goddamn did I laugh hard.", "I went into it expecting it to be terrible based on what I had seen from the trailers. It actually wasn't anywhere near as bad I was expecting it to be. With that said, it's still not very good. There are funny moments here and there (2 scenes actually made me laugh really hard), but the main problem is that a lot of jokes are way too predictable or some of the ones that are funny go on for way too long. There were also some jokes in the first half where it felt like they were trying too hard to be vulgar for the sake of it which didn't work well either. Ed Helms did a good job and most of the supporting cast was good as well. Charlie Day's appearance was probably the funniest part of the movie. Did a pretty nice job of paying tribute to the original in places too. Overall, it's not horrible like I think many expected it to be, but wait to rent it. There's really to go out and see it in theaters and I'm probably going to completely forget about it within the next 24 hours. ", "Screw me, I thought it was good. There were some situations that genuinely made me laugh out loud, and I actually thought the message of what we expect out of our family to be somewhat poignant. Is it a classic like the original? No. But I thought the gags worked, and though they got tired by the end, the movie balanced sweetness and raunch well and made for a fun 95 minutes. And sometimes shit is just funny. The rimjob thing was a bit formulaic though. ", "I rather enjoyed it. Saw it last night after Trainwreck and had a better time with it. Yeah it does lack the subtlety of Trainwreck, but I laughed way more in it. I know humor is mostly opinionated, but there were other qualities in Vacation.\n \nHaven't seen people mention Ed Helms performance, which felt like the core of this remake, he emulated Chevy in the original perfectly. If it wasn't for him or Wally World it probably could of been anything else.\n\nMost of the minor roles and cameos were well acted. Hemsworth tries his best texan accent. Chevy and Beverly, Keegan Micheal Key, Charlie Day, other airline pilot and the four corner cops.\n\nStory was satisfying. This is my biggest problem with Trainwreck, which had so many fuckin plot threads dangling, I couldn't really care for once they came to resolution. And for a comedy some of these didn't lend themselves to humor, or emotionally satisfying connection. Now Vacation lent some of its screentime to pointless gags and set ups, I was fine with them because more times than not (or Trainwreck), they worked. Fuck typing. The ending for Vacation actually gave me a bit of satisfaction to see 'em all on the coaster all happy (sans John Candy:/). I had no fuckin clue I was watching the end of TrainWreck as it happened.\n\nI don't know, a mildly decent remake written by unproven writers was funnier and more enjoyable than A Judd Apatow film written by arguably one of the biggest comedians around co-starring Bill Hader.

Margo herself was rather unsympathetic, (though apparently in the book she has some sort of depression that makes her leave, which isn't apparent at all in the film) and really paints her as a really pretentious person who no one can understand. For all the talk of how \"she is something\" they never really made her feel that mythic or special leading up to the end of the movie, which in turn makes Q's realization of himself building up Margo as a character fall flat. Although apparently in the book, the kiss between the two at the end also felt forced (they're really, really flat characters) and kind of a betrayed what the movie was trying to say. \n\nThe road trip was fun, some of the character interactions were cute but the meat of the film was really mediocre. If you like Fault in Our Stars (which I'd probably rate 6/10), you'll probably like this. I'd rate it a 5/10.", "The scene that stood out to me that hasn't gotten out of my head that will stay with me was the prom scene. Just the camerawork mixed with the slow-motion and put in **HAIM's \"Falling\"** was just absolute perfection. Favorite scene out of the whole film.\n\nI just thought the beginning and ending of the movie were pretty strong, but the middle was always iffy for me. \n\nThe soundtrack was amazing as someone said in the thread, I really want the original score cause it was just so good. Ryan Lott should really get more work, very underrated.\n\nAnd finally, the Ansel Elgort cameo was unexpected to me. I have a feeling they are going to do an Edgar Wright thing. He's the Cornetto to the John Green Trilogy of films. Along with Nat Wolff as well.", "What crazy timing is it that this movie would come out right when the Confederate flag is such a hot topic? Radar's shirt was not added as social commentary, that was in the book.\n\nMargot is a deconstruction of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope, and I definitely thought they laid that on more heavily in the movie than the book. I haven't read the book in a few years but her speech at the end about not being who people think she is was pretty heavy handed.  The book felt much more subtle about it.\n\nOverall I enjoyed it. I thought the dialogue was more believable than The Fault in our Stars.", "I thought the movie was trying to say that they had Margo completely wrong to leave and that she was terrible to everyone. She only acted selfish not realizing that she hurt people. The only person who couldn't figure that out was Q. \nI read the book and was fine with the changing of the ending. \nI really think they should've cut the part where the little kid talks about strings breaking in her. That was so awkward.", "As someone who read this book, I was very excited to see it. It totally paid homage to the fans of The Fault In Our Stars -- the Ansel Elgort cameo had girls in my theater squeeling. I thought it was funny but I don't think Cara Delevingne is really that great of an actress. She's alright, but I think the saving grace is that she's in about 30% of this movie...which plays really well with the point of the movie. Q is absolutely obsessed with finding her, and the idea of her...yet, he barely knows her but proclaims he is in love with her. The friends were very funny, but I felt they were throwing around names of colleges too much to make points about who these characters were (the one preppy I-just-act-blonde girl says \"I'm smart, I'm going to Dartmouth for godsake!\") which I felt acted too hard to define their characters, which the whole movie's point was to *not* define people by their covers. The movie was pretty, the soundtrack was FANTASTIC. It did it's job though -- a teenage summer romance movie trailing off the success of TFIOS. I like John Green movies, and I think they should be made more if they're connected by actors in such a way. The movie did justice to the book, but the leads were way too one-dimensional. I found myself more interested in Radar and Angela's romance than Q and Margo's, hell even Ben was more intriguing.", "I don't understand the hate, really. I'm kind of suprised.\n\nI went in not knowing much of anything (I knew she goes missing and leaves clues and that's it.)\n\nGod that ending was an emotional gut punch. The saddest I've felt in years, and I think it has to do with how I could relate to the characters, and feel for them. So if you're in high school this might be easier to relate to.\n\nBut wow, even though the ending broke me, it really did feel complete. I think it was necessary.\n\nWe are rooting for this guy throughout the movie, and in the end it turns out he misread things. And I think the film did a good job of letting us believe he was right too.\n\nBut the realization was the same for me as it was for him- that she is just a girl and he was wrong.\n\nI loved every second of it.\n\nIt was the closest I've come to crying in film in quite a while.", "I really liked this - the relationship between the three friends was especially lovely.", "Man that ending felt empty. I didn't read the book but after all Margo did, it felt like a huge depressing letdown. \n\nYou follow Q living his normal day to day routine, and then one night adventure with Margo and she leaves him saying, you're better confident and live outside your comfort zone. She leaves clues pointing to her and encourages him to do all those things. You would think she would expect him at least in the next year to find her. Yea, she would have been surprised to see him so soon. But man after seeing her reaction and her reasoning, it just made me feel empty and saddened, like a big empty lie. But Q ended up happy about it!!! \n\n\nThe other secondary character's stories were fine, but the whole main plot played with my emotions too much.", "My wife read the book and was very excited to see it. I just liked The Fault In Our Stars.\n\nI think Nat Wolff did a good job as the lead. I didn't like the friends though, but I will say their chemistry together felt real.\n\nI also liked the interactions between the leads, which all went towards an ending that made a lot of sense. I like it when cliches are avoided, and it is a good topic to talk about. Basic nice guy syndrome. I just don't think the movie handled it too well.\n\nAnd damn it, the movie didn't even make me cry. I just wanted more. [Full review here](http://gorgview.com/paper-towns)!", "I saw it last night and I tried really hard to like it. I really did. I'd been looking forward to this movie for months. It just didn't do it for me. And here's why:\n\n Awful dialogue. You can't copy lines word-for-word straight from the book and expect the dialogue to sound like fluid, natural conversation. The things these teenagers were saying were things people just don't say (especially adolescents): \"What a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.\" Do people talk like that? Nat Wolff's monologue throughout the movie was just too awkward and everything didn't feel right. Young Margo said: \"All the strings in him broke\" (taken directly from the book). Do children say that? Come on, make realistic characters, John Green.\n\nI don't think Nat Wolff was a strong lead, and Cara Delevingne did nothing out of the ordinary either. There were parts that made me laugh, but you could tell there were scenes where you were supposed to laugh, but my entire theater and I sat in very awkward silence. I felt it was a complete letdown. \n\nTip for directors: when you bring a book to life, don't copy the stupid shit, like what the characters said *exactly*. It doesn't work. Overall, it was just another young adult movie where teens do things teens don't do, like go on roadtrips and run away from home and say things like \"Look at this paper town: full of paper streets and paper people.\" John Green always talks about how strongly he feels about teenagers. It's movies like this that make teens look like pretentious fools trying to \"find\" themselves. \n  \nEdit: I will say that they picked an absolutely beautiful soundtrack.", "I liked the movie. I think it did the book justice and I preferred how the movie ended the story. I thought Cara Delevingne did great and can't wait to see her in Suicide Squad.", "I was actually looking forward to this film and I have mixed feelings about it. The cinematography actually surprised me a few times because I didn't expect that type of quality in the film, and the soundtrack was a perfect fit. \n\nHowever, the 2 main characters, to me, were bland, and I thought that the supporting characters were more likable. Although it's hard to condense book characters down into a single film, I think they could have done better. \n\nI came out the cinema pleased with the experience, and was somewhat surprised, but in hindsight I think it was mediocre. \n\nThe ending is typical John Green; a slap across the face, hitting the average viewer with something they don't expect and I think that it's quite refreshing to see in a somewhat mainstream film.\n\nOverall I'd give it around a 6.5/10 to be specific. I would be happy to watch it again, and would probably recommend it to some of my friends.", "I went with my wife and although Im well outside of the targeted audience (35 male),  I had decent hopes as I enjoyed TFIOS. \n\nI absolutely hated the movie.  The acting outside of the three main characters was wooden,  the dialogue was at most points weak and often laughable (pretty much anything not played for humor I found to be cliche and terrible) .   The story and the message it was trying to get across was pretty much shoved down your throat without any nuance. \n\nThe soundtrack was decent,  and the comedic elements were OK.  That's about it for me when it comes to positives. \n\nI can't help but compare it a bit to Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, which many similar elements in terms of style and pacing,  but was told in significantly more effective way. ", "I enjoyed it.\n\nIt's not my favorite John Green book, 3rd behind Alaska and Fault in our Stars, but I still enjoyed the book. The movie was really faithful to the book, and I think they got the idea that people are more complex than we view them across really well.\n\nThe Ansel Elgort cameo got me good. That was one of the coolest moments of the movie.\n\nNot a great movie, but not nearly as bad as some people are saying. 6.75/7 out of 10.\n\nAlso, the funniest part of the movie was when Ben, Radar, and Q were singing the Pokemon theme. So out of left field and perfect for the characters. ", "Just got back from seeing it with my daughter. She was the one who really wanted to see it, and I owed her a girls' afternoon out, so... In the end, I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.\n\nDespite the occasional overused cliches (idiot guy gets pretty popular girl because he's the only one who 'really sees her'), it was a worthwhile deconstruction of the 'manic pixie dream girl' trope. And there were moments that made me laugh because as awkward and pretentious as they were, they reminded me of a time in my life when we really WOULD say and do all these awkward, pretentious things because we thought we sounded mature and deep and philosophical.\n\nQ kinda fell flat as a character, like he and his obsession weren't much more than a prop for everybody around him to bounce off of. But in a way, that worked - who, in our teenage years, HASN'T felt at least once like that was your life? A lot of the things that are weird and awkward about the whole movie are the things that are weird and awkward about growing up.\n\nMargo, for her bit of screentime, was perfect. The casual self-absorption of the character shone through without being overbearing. And I loved Angela - it was nice to see a young black girl in a movie like this who wasn't hamming up the 'angry/sassy sister' stereotype.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I let the kid drag me along, and I might even pick up the book to get that perspective on the story as well.", "When the Game of Thrones reference came up in the movie, I was the only person in the entire theater who laughed. It was a little mortifying, but I have no regrets!!", "The movie was funnier than expected! The ending was quite different from the book, however. ", "So I am a fan of John Green despite the fact that his books are somewhat formulaic and a little too heavy-handed with character tropes, e.g. shy nerdy guy, main girl who is mysterious and smart and gorgeous, side quirky characters to main shy nerdy guy etc.\nWith that said I read the book and loved it - the characters infuriated me with their selfishness, because that's actually how teenagers act instead of being perfect mini-adults in so many stories. I just love the concept of glorifying a person to the extent that Q does Margo, I think we all had that stupid high school crush where we look back and say \"what did I see in that person?\" - it's a very relatable situation. \n\n\nIn saying that though the movie failed to capture alot of the 'small' details that gave you a sense of Q as a person beyond his boring exterior, and I think that's one of the biggest reasons the movie fell flat. Q is boring in the book and that's kind of the point; he is that way for so many reasons which the movie wasn't bothered to touch on at all. Thus it became up to Ben and Radar to breathe life into a movie that, had it just been 10 - 15 minutes longer and included a bit more details, would have been so much more enjoyable.\n\n\nI think the actors generally did well with what they were dealt with as far as the script goes, and unlike some other commenters I think Cara Delevingne did a really good job overall, especially at the end.\n\n\nAlso the whole movie just felt like a race to the end, which is not a good way to set up the viewer for the sort of ending that Paper Towns gives you. (Not really a good way for any movie but just particularly bad in this scenario).\nA solid 6/10 from me.

All the actor's did a good job, Sutter's dialogue was solid, and the movie was filmed well. I just want more out of it.

I essentially went in already knowing every major plot point besides whether or not Hope would win his final redemption fight (which wasn't too hard to guess). That being said, I still really liked the movie. While a lot of it was fairly cliched, Jake Gyllenhaal's performance seriously elevates the movie to being really enjoyable. I'm somewhere between a 7 and 8 out of 10 on it, definitely worth a watch though. ", "I went into this film expecting an average film with a great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal;  I left with my expectations met.  The story is filled with predictable cliches, but that doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching.  Gyllenhaal delivers yet another exceptional performance that took a mediocre at best film and dragged it along to being pretty decent.  Both Whitaker and McAdams made characters that we've seen a hundred times interesting with their deliveries.  Laurence was surprisingly good.  Children don't typically impress me, and while I wasn't blown away by her I certainly wasn't distracted.  I hope we get to see more of her.\n\nThe cliched story could have been helped out with 15-30 minutes of time spent on smaller characters [Hope's \"bodyguard,\" Hector, Hoppy] (/s)and subplots [Hope's \"out of nowhere\" bankruptcy, Mains' \"get out of jail free\" card, etc.] (/s)\n\nI imagine that most of y'all can plot out most, if not all of the film in your heads, but the performances help to carry this film to a level that makes it worth watching.", "I just got back from it and I have to say I really enjoyed the film.  Now with that said I do agree with the time issue, everything seemed rush, the bankruptcy, I was under the impression he was on his first 30 days when in the court hearing, but then after that it was mentioned it had been months.  That also confused me when 50 Cent said Jake's suspension from boxing could be shortened.  I thought \"wait it's only been a little of 30 days, and he has a year suspension.\" I understand why they needed to rush it, but some indication of time passing would've been nice.  \n\nOverall I loved the film and I will actually be doing a full review soon, so I would love to talk more about it.", "If you like the trailer, this film delivers on it.\n\nRandom thoughts I had while watching the movie:\n\n* You can really tell that this script was originally written for Eminem to star in. In some scenes, it's like Jake is playing Eminem playing Billy.\n\n* It's like Kurt Sutter was thinking \"I'm gonna remake Rocky V, but do it the right way.\" (With a dash of Rocky III)\n\n* No one could figure out who shot his wife? That and the revenge angle seemed a bit far fetched. Cancer or a car crash would have been more believable.\n\n* Poor Hoppy, but quite a silver lining to motivate his trainer.\n\n* Jake looks ripped. Did they use some kind of glue to droop his eye like that?\n\n* In the original script, Hope was a lefty--hence the title Southpaw. Kurt Sutter compared Eminem's being a white rapper to how Southpaws are viewed in the world of boxing. It felt like a shoehorned in reference in the finished film. Weird that the title of the film became a technique, like going \"Over the Top.\"\n\n* Needed more of a training montage. Ultimately, Billy learned defense, punching with his left hand, and to control his anger a bit.  The thing with the string was cool.\n\nAll in all, not a bad film. Will probably play better on cable/Netflix. I have higher hopes for Creed.\n\n**ETA: Tyrese was in this? I didn't spot him in the film, and he's not listed on IMDb. A bit of Googling showed that he was cast in the film, but maybe his scenes were cut?

What you saw in the trailer is what you got. If you thought it looked like every other schmaltzy sports redemption story, then you'll probably not like it.

It doesn't break any barriers, but it's not bad.\n\nThe boxing scenes were really well done though. I read that they brought in the people who film HBO's matches to direct them and those really shine above the rest of the movie.", "I am sad to see this getting mixed reviews.\n\nI saw a screening on monday and it left me an emotional wreck.

Good guy wins, fighter has to fight to fix life that was destroyed by fighting. But I think the characters and acting really made this movie something special.

Also, Jake's daughter looks exactly like my little sister, so maybe it tugged on my heart strings more than others. \n\nIf you like Gyllenhaal, it's a good watch. If your not a fan, give it a pass.

First I will say that right before the movie began, I checked the ratings and saw it was at 54% on RT. Disappointing so my hopes were not high.\n\n>But that movie was amazing. The raw emotion that Jake showed was extremely intense the entire film. This was not a movie about boxing, it was a movie about an emotional journey of a man.\n\n>As the trailer spoils, Rachel McAdams dies. This happens pretty early in the film and the rest is a semi-poorly written script on his downward spiral and redemption. While I was not a fan of the writing, Rachel and Jake both shined bright.\n\n>If you've been watching the new True Detective season, you've seen a side of Rachel McAdams that she hasn't shown before. This is another. Rachel's character is an extremely realistic, semi-trashy girl who plays the part perfectly. When she shrugs when Jake looks at her in between rounds in the first match, it portrays a girl who grew up with Jake's character and does not love, but lives with his career out of necessity. She never celebrates the huge money but clearly enjoys it, nearly to a fault. The way she played the character was perfect for the background they gave.\n\n>As for Jake, it was a brilliant performance. The way he acted in Rachel's death scene was perfect. While the death itself was not particularly realistic, Rachel's reaction and the way Jake held her and talked to her was more realistic than I've ever seen in any movie. It showed the pure fear he had for losing someone he'd grown up with. It showed how much he depended on her. It made me shed a few tears.\n\n>Jake's character was played as a hyper-emotional, dumb kid, who grew up in the foster system. He nailed it at every turn. Meeting his new boxing trainer, perfect. Frustration with his comeback, perfect. Dealing with his daughter in uncharted territory, perfect. He truly got into this character's head and the dedication to his work was evident. He lived and breathed this character every second of the film.\n\n>This was a character that Jake had never played before. While I thought his worst performance was Source Code, where he didn't show much at all, he added another masterful performance to his collection here. Between Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, End of Watch, Zodiac, Jarhead, Brokeback Mountain, Bubble Boy, Donnie Darko, October Sky, and now Southpaw, Jake Gyllenhaal is truly one of the most versatile actors of our generation. It is truly a pleasure to see him perform- especially when we have actors who play basically the same character at every turn (Michael Cera, Liam Neeson, Kevin Hart, Melissa McCarthy, etc.).\n\n>My biggest gripe in the movie was probably that he literally was a southpaw fighter for one second of the entire film, and the lone reference to being a southpaw was of no significance whatsoever. But if you're not a big fight fan, you likely wouldn't notice that anyway.\nIf I could rate a movie just on the raw performance of the lead actor, I'd give it a 10/10. Unfortunately the writing was weak and some of the secondary characters were weak/underdeveloped (the random extra death, 50 Cent's performance and Forest Whitaker to an extent), so I'll give the movie an overall 6.5/10.", "Even though the fate of Rachel McAdams is revealed in the trailer, I didn't expect to cry so hard- excuse me, BAWL that hard when it  actually happened.

It had no idea what it wanted to be before Billy met Titus.  Was it a boxing movie?  A movie about dealing with grief and depression?  A revenge movie?

Oh, Billy's bankrupt all of a sudden after showing no signs of that except Billy bought some watches for his friends?  Billy's career is over after his first loss in 44 fights?  He won a charity fight so now that gives him the right to fight for the title?  He lets his daughter watch his fights so she goes from \"it should have been you who died\" to I love you?  Ugh, such a messy script.  I had no hype for the final fight whatsoever, it just kind of came after a 2 minute training montage.  And speaking of that montage, we literally got the title of the movie and the reason that Billy won the fight based off a 10 second throw away line that Titus gave him.     \n\nOn the plus side, the directing during the boxing scenes was really well done, and Gyllenhaal gave a pretty good performance, although by his standards it's not one of his best.

Anyway, never mind.\" If 50 Cent is fixing fights you can be damn sure that he fixed your climactic fight at the end of the movie. That would make a better story, meaning more money. The ending just became more meaningless.\n\nThe acting is great, but the characters are dumb. 50 Cent was struggling, but it's not his fault. They put him into a role with too much dialogue. And for a singer, he doesn't enunciate very well.\n\nThe music was too on the nose. The foundation of the story was built on tropes. Again, it's as if a group of people made a list of things that need to be in a boxing movie, then they glued it all together into a frenetic mess.\n\nCompared to Terminator: Genisys, it was fucking awesome.", "This was a 5/10 for me. Pretty cliche, heavy on the melodramatics and quite frankly, I just didn't care about Billy Hope. Gyllenhaal was fantastic, but that character essentially brought everything onto himself.

Antoine Fuqua is not a good director. he is not. in the hands of a more capable director this movie could have had Oscar written all over it. but no. he did not let Jake Gyllenhaal's amazing performance shine through, he had to make himself the star of the movie and not the actors or the story. the editing and the acting saved this movie from being a total wreck. Gyllenghall deserves better. he gave an amazing performance. give this movie a 7/10", "Gyllenhaal is absolutely phenomenal. Coming off of *Prisoners*, *Enemy*, and *Nightcrawler*, this performance is just as satisfying, if not more so. There's also some subtlety within Fuqua's direction and Fiore's cinematography, which was nice to see (though the screen in the boxing arena looked really out-of-place, like someone just superimposed additional footage on top of it). I mean, the movie's not at all nuanced, but there was some care and effort put into it.\n\nI think the turning point for this film comes about 2/3rds of the way in. There's a moment where Gyllenhaal's character can do one of two things. If he chooses the first, the movie becomes a redemption story. If he chooses the second, the movie becomes a character study. He chooses the first, and the film lost all emotion from me. I went from almost crying to feeling nothing in 5 minutes flat. Not the movie's fault, I was just hoping for the ending to be something unique and interesting, rather than something flat and predictable.

Otherwise, I don't know how I would have made it.", "I'm never going to see anything with Adam Sandler's stupid name attached to it ever again.\n\nNever wanted to unwatch a movie so bad in my entire life", "There was a very brief moment where I thought I might be able to tolerate this movie. It had kind of a \"The Longest Yard\" feel in an early scene between Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan that was legitimately enjoyable. However, this is typical Happy Madison where it is 98% so unfunny it hurts and 2% funny. Easiest thing to do is to break this into pros and cons:  \n\n**Pros:**  \n\n1. Adam Sandler plays the straight man and manages to be the least annoying out of any character. Lots of his jokes miss, but he's really not as bad as the others.\n\n2. The visual effect of seeing something get pixelated is just really cool. No complaints about that. Also, the sound was surprisingly good. \n\n**Cons**  \n\n1. No sense was made. I don't understand the aliens. A centipede stops in a hotel room to dance to something on the TV. Q*Bert somehow turns into Ashley Benson and procreates with Josh Gad WITHOUT EXPLANATION. No consequences to any action. No national security. No one is shocked by aliens. The Pentagon apparently has cyborgs and the ability to create light weaponry in two days time. WTF is this shit?\n\n2. Peter Dinklage. He had the accent of a Blaxploitation character for some unknown reason. Every line out of his mouth was rough to endure.\n\n3. Josh Gad. Apparently, either Josh Gad or whoever wrote his character, had recently downloaded the Vine app. This is how they determined that the funniest thing to do is to yell every line and fall down. \n\n4. Kevin James. I was almost certain they were joking when they said he was the POTUS. Alas, no. Kevin James portrays the President. If that's not stupid enough in and of its self, a running gag throughout the movie is that he struggles to read. No one was aware of the fact that most Presidents go to Ivy League schools and do phenomenal academically, I guess. \n\n5. And finally, the worst of the worst: Q*Bert. This annoying piece of shit says some of the most baffling, retarded things in the movie. He just kind of appears in the movie and instantly becomes loved and accepted by the protagonists. Ya know, even though he's a fucking alien. He pisses out orange goo at one point and inexplicably survives when all other aliens leave the planet or get depixelated. He makes Michelle Monaghan risk her life to save him even though we see the little fucker get blown up and repixelate earlier on. Clearly, he's invincible, but the evil bastard is trying to kill her.\n\n**TL;DR**: Pixels fails tremendously in almost every aspect. It's not funny. It's not sci-fi. It's not a movie for adults or kids. There are no stakes, consequences, or logic behind anything portrayed. Actors that you normally love suck ass. And the biggest sin is that it didn't even make me nostalgic. At the very least, it should have made me want to play some retro video games. I want my time and money back. **DON'T GO SEE IT** 1/10", "**The Positives**\n\n* The sequences involving the video games were superbly done.  The CGI, as expected, was amazing.\n \n* The music selection was cool.\n\n* The 8-bit synopsis of the movie that ran during the closing credits was a nice touch. \n\n**The Negatives**\n\nEverything else.\n\n* Even by Adam Sandler's standards, he didn't even seem to put enough effort into his acting to reach \"phoning it in\" levels.  He seemed bored literally right from the opening sequence, and it was obvious he signed on for the movie for yet another free vacation.\n\n* In a movie about video games from 1982 that was supposed to appeal to people who enjoyed video games from 1982, they couldn't even get half of the video game references that this movie was supposed to be about right.  Pac Man Cheat Codes?  Really?  \n\n* There was no storyline.  At all.  They knew that people were only going to see the movie for the nostalgia and CGI effects, and didn't even bother trying to give anything remotely resembling a storyline beyond that.   We went from the kids meeting at an arcade, to the 1982 championship finals, to Kevin James becoming president with no segue or explanation at all, to Guam being attacked in one of the lamest segments ever, to everyone figuring out it was a Galaga attack and just accepting it....all in the first 5, maybe 10 minutes of the movie.  \n\n* What little storyline existed required ENORMOUS leaps of logic and suspension of disbelief even by \"Video games from 1982 attack Earth in 2015\" standards.  Nobody from the Secret Service questions a cable repair man just wandering aimlessly around the White House unescorted?  The world is under attack, and the President of the US is at a bakery making a cake with his wife for some PR?  Why?  \n\n* There was no character development and not a single character had any real bearing on the story at all.  So what if one of them was a conspiracy theorist and another was in jail?  They could have replaced each and every character with the stick figure from Atari 2600's \"Outlaw\" game and it wouldn't have mattered.  \n\n* Random subplots were introduced that had no bearing on the story at all, and in some cases went completely unresolved.   The subplot involving Kevin James' marital troubles is a prime example of this.\n\n* The rules of this intergalactic \"war\" didn't make the least bit of sense, and were changed completely at random.  Q-Bert was given to Sandler as a \"trophy\" for winning the Pac Man game because reasons, then later was inexplicably declared a traitor by the alien race because other reasons.  \n\n* Q-Bert turns into a hot blonde woman, hooks up with a human being, and gives birth to a handful of pixelated baby Q-Berts.  WTF?  And yes, that really happened.\n\nThere is only one way to enjoy this movie.  Rent it from Redbox, fast-forward to the Centipede, Pac Man, and Donkey Kong scenes, and pretend the rest doesn't exist.   Given the effort put into making the rest of this movie, that's basically what the cast and crew did anyway.    Watching the movie, there was a LOT of potential for this to become a good mix of \"Independence Day meets Ghostbusters meets video games\", and you'll find yourself screaming at the screen every time a golden opportunity for laughs, nostalgia, or just a good scene was missed.  Which is about every 5 minutes.\n\nI'll end this by saying this:  The Pac Man and Centipede scenes were really cool, and seem to be the only scenes in the entire movie that anyone on the cast or crew really gave a %&)^% about.\n\n\n\n", "Someone please tell me about Peter Dinkledge, tell me his role was good, tell me he was a beam of light in a dark horrible movie. Please tell me Dinkledge was exellance in a horid movie.", "I honestly really liked this movie. I knew going in that I was going to have to overlook a lot of things, but I actually thought that it was a funny and enjoyable movie. Sandler and James' parts were both pretty awful, but the CGI and the other characters made for some pretty enjoyable moments.", "Did the movie try to imply the Duck Hunt dog was relevant before 1982, only to 100% drop that plot point?", "I'm gonna be honest: **I enjoyed this movie.**\n\nAs a french guy, our country doesn't like Adam Sandler - none of the movies he starred in was a box office success since the beginning of his career. I've saw some of his movies, and I enjoyed some of them - I really liked The Longest Yard and Click, but couldn't go to the end of Jack & Jill for example. I didn't watch all his filmography but well, he did most piss-and-shit movies recently.\n\nI wasn't expecting something huge, something masterpieceful or anything that could be memorable - I knew since the trailers that it would just be some kind of entertaining summer blockbuster with some crack jokes and lots of video game references.\n\nAnd that's what the movie delivered - action, video games, references, crack jokes and delighting visuals. Plot? What plot? 80s video games attacking the world, why would you go further and make something deep? Let's just go all fun and nonsense and we'll keep the plot for later.\n\nSo okay, we might have some cringy moments but we're A BILLION LIGHT YEARS away from Grown Ups 2 or Jack & Jill level of \"humor\". It's still Sandlerish but at least it's not unbearable. I understand though that peeing Q-bert and Lady Lisa being a trophy at the end - I expected it at the second the word trophy was said, I knew that Lady Lisa would become the final trophy - will definitely turn people off. But it's not like that the entire movie, and sometimes it has some impact.\n\nForced romance, stereotypes, crack jokes, well we've seen that in a hell of a lot of movies. I just watched and said \"well, why not, just enjoy the show and the games\". All the other actors were fine in their role, Dinklage was superb, and the action scenes are clear and fun to watch. Don't even care if Sandler manages to shoot and drive like Dominic Toretto - at the second the aliens attacked Earth, let's just pretend it's another world, it's already a game. And that's why they're all good - they excel at the games they're playing and when they become the characters of their games to fight the aliens, they're naturally as good as them - because reasons. \n\nI understand people can hate this movie. But I enjoyed the movie, and it's not one of the worst Adam Sandler movies. And it isn't an insult to video games to me - it was a fun ride. Though, if I want to show a movie about video games, I'll still go with Wreck-It Ralph or Scott Pilgrim. \n\nAs a gamer, I came for the games and the fun. And even if it's far from a masterpiece, I enjoyed, I laughed (not all the time but still), and I left my seat at the end satisfied.\n\nCan't wait for the Ready Player One adaptation by Spielberg, which I hope, will fix some problems in the original book (that I thoroughly enjoyed too).", "**I** loved this movie! I don't get why you guys **hated it**. Adam Sandler went **all** in with his phenomenal acting as **the** lead role and paving the **way** for interesting characters like Qbert. All in all, when I got **through** the movie, I was begging for more.", "It's one of the better sandler movies of the last couple of years. I actually laughed in this unlike his other movies like jack and jill", "I can't possibly be the only person who actually *enjoyed* it, could I? ", "It says a lot that my favorite part of Pixels, the visual effects used for the destruction of buildings, was lifted directly from the short film the movie is based off. Nothing interesting was added to the original concept. I could talk endlessly about my problems with this film. I could criticize Columbus\u2019s weak direction and the sexism that runs rampant throughout the film. I could tear apart plot conveniences like Sandler\u2019s gang somehow knowing how to handle guns and expertly maneuver Mini Coopers. I could point out that the sexy alien switches sides and the invaders only attack famous landmarks because the movie is backward engineered to account for set pieces instead of common sense. I can say that Adam Sandler's character is a dick.\n\nFrankly though, I don\u2019t think this movie deserves to be discussed at all. ", "All i keep seeing are people ripping this movie to shreds. Most of the people hating on this haven't even seen the movie, they're just judging it because it's an Adam Sandler movie. I saw the movie on Wednesday at my work at the movies and i thought it was hilarious. You go in knowing already it's an Adam Sandler movie so just go have fun because it is a fun cheesy movie. His best in forever so it's worth a watch because it is funny and the visuals are really good too. I noticed a lot of really cheesy parts but who gives a crap, what do you expect with an Adam Sandler movie. Enjoy it because it definely doesn't deserve all the hate that it is getting", "I feel like a stupid asshole for saying that I didn't hate it. I laughed a few times, I thought the special effects and action were pretty cool.

Aaron responds saying what are you talking about, we're fighting and then we'll work through it. It was a pretty emotionally complex movie while the plot was still pretty predictable.\n\nAlso, Tilda Swinton was bonkers and totally unrecognizable....I still can't believe that was her!", "I loved it. The jokes land wayyyy more times than not, the emotional notes feel honest, and the cast all deliver in spades working with Schumer's terrific script and Apatow's best direction to date. A few thoughts:\n\n* I loved how Amy wasn't always a likeable character, but you still root for her because you realize that she is her own worst enemy and she's coming to terms with that. \n\n* Schumer and Hader's chemistry is definitely felt, and the supporting characters nearly all have their own moments and personality traits that make them distinct. God I loved these characters and this cast.\n\n* I was kind of worried that Aaron was going to be a \"Manic Pixie Dream Guy\" but he really has a lot on his plate besides trying to work out a relationship with Amy. His relationship with Amy, while extremely important to him, isn't the only thing that he is ever dealing with.\n\n* The scene with Ezra Miller and Amy hooking up was hysterically funny. It was just such a hilarious, unpredictable, bizarre scene. Amy's face when she's licking his nipple was gut busting.\n\n* Amy and Aaron sitting on the bench with \"Rhapsody in Blue\" playing and the Woody Allen/ Soon-Yi joke was just gold. It wasn't like a \"HAHA Woody has a wife who is way younger than him!\" joke either. You could tell how much Schumer, Apatow, and Hader love Allen and his movies.\n\n* The length might have bothered some others, but the pacing never dragged for me. It really could have been longer and I wouldn't have minded. I just enjoyed spending time with these characters and getting to know them more.\n\nSo yeah, I really enjoyed this one. ", "Why isn't this stickied like most discussions on the day of release?", "It's laugh out loud funny throughout the film and almost everyone (including LeBron) gives a solid performance. If you look down your nose at the previous Apatow stuff you will look down your nose at this but why the fuck would you even go see it if that is your predisposition?", "This is a very standard Judd Apatow movie, which basically, to me, means that the first half of it is hysterically funny, and the second half drags...and drags...and then keeps dragging...and then drags a little more...then ends.\n\nMuch like Knocked Up and Funny People, it blows its load very early and can't sustain the momentum. The \"stakes\" of Schumer/Hader's inevitable breakup are so painfully low (she took a phone call during his big speech) that you are just sitting there like \"Okay...we get it...just get to the making up part and let's go home.\"\n\nThat being said, Lebron and John Cena steal the show (Cena has the funniest line in the whole movie in my opinion), and the first half is funny enough for me to recommend. Solid B from me. If it was 90 minutes long, it would probably be an A-.", "Honestly this movie was hilarious, i was pleasantly surprised with the variety of jokes as well as the quality of them. Both the non actor actors, Cena and Lebron were actually surprisingly good. I laughed so hard i ended up giving myself a headache when Cena said \"Ill meet you in the parking lot, and if you cant find me ill be the closest one on Grindr\". Kind of an abrupt ending, but even the somber parts had some decent jokes in them. Would definitely recommend. ", "\"FFFFFFUDGE RIPPPLE ICE CREAM\"\nand Bill Hader's \"Fuuucccckkk you\" to LeBron when he \"forgets\" his wallet were my favorite moments. All in all, a really good date movie.", "The first half was real funny, then it started to get more serious around the halfway point. There were some good moments in it though. I would recommend to see it. John Cena is a funny ass guy ", "I liked it a lot. I thought Amy Schumer was pretty great throughout, as was Bill Hader. \n\nOnly issue I had was the intervention scene. That scene fell super flat for me. Like hard. No one laughed in the theater during that scene. \n\nAnd Tony Romo is da real MVP", "Loved it. Schumer was great at both bringing the laughs and killing it in the more emotional scenes. I liked how even though it was a more traditional rom-com, it still had plenty of surprises like Schumer's relationship with her sister and loved how the supporting characters still brought much to the table, especially Lebron and Bayer. Worth it for the John Cena dirty talk scene alone tbh. ", "Found this movie hilarious throughout. While it certainly had its pacing problems and the second half dragged, the laughs for me did not lighten up while things were trying to be a bit more serious. \n\nAll the performances were pretty spectacular and John Cena made the movie for me. Can't wait to see him in more comedies going forward. \n\nThis is the best comedy I have seen since What We Do in the Shadows, which I saw last year. With that said I don't watch too many comedies, so take that with a grain of salt.", "I really really did not enjoy this movie. It was SO boring. Nearly every scene dragged on for too long, Amy's character was very unlikable. The jokes that were actually funny were few and far between and mostly caused forced laughs from me. If I hadn't been with friends, I would have left probably halfway through. Boyfriend decided to sleep 40 minutes in because he was so bored.\n\nThe story is not original and there is almost no conflict because we know that they will end up together. And I was surprised that the \"moral\" of the story is you will not be happy If you sleep around and you need to be monogamous to be successful. I found this confusing since Amy always talks about being free sexually and blah blah. And again her character is SO UNLIKABLE. She is mean and rude to everyone except her Dad. She's lazy and ruins things for several other characters. Then by the end she does some stupid as hell dance number and we are all supposed to like her... and are her and Aaron not going to be discussing her almost fucking a 16 year old in the 2 days they were on break??\n\n", "I thought it was a really funny. John Cena and LeBron are both surprisingly good at comedy. People give Amy a lot of shit for her stand-up but I'd say her sketch show is more indicative of her writing so if you like that, you'll probably enjoy this. ", "I'm a really big fan of Amy's stand up and her sketch show. I like some Apatow movies (This is 40 was one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever seen in a movie theater but I loved 40 Year Old Virgin).\n\nThe screening I went to had audio problems (music/score not playing at right level) and even with that jokes were landing, but it made things stand out that just weren't working. \n\nThe narration is awkward and is abandoned after it serves its purpose. Performances are good for the most part. John Cena is hilarious and Lebron has some really funny jokes throughout. Tilda Swinton kills it... easily my favorite in the whole movie.\n\nMy biggest problem was a lack of believability in a lot of story points (the break up comes out of nowhere and is resolved in the weirdest way, the Dad character loves Bill Hader then he hates him then he's dead). The progression of events felt forced. And many scenes were too long or completely unnecessary (that intervention scene was painful for me). \n\nWhen jokes landed, it was great. I bet if you shaved 30+ minutes off of it, it'd improve by leaps and bounds. The Woody Allen joke was fantastic.", "The ending reminded me a lot of Never Been Kissed; writer writes a story for boy telling him how she feels then meets him at a sports complex to have the big reuniting (baseball diamond vs basketball court). Although  How to Lose a Day in 10 Days is also along the same formula...I guess it's a more common trope than I thought ", "Honestly, I was sorely disappointed. Disclaimer: I'm a huge Apatow fan, and one of the few people  who really loved Funny People. That being said, this movie was just...sad. Nearly every line of plot (of which there are definitely too many) is just sad. Okay, she has lots of sex, got it. But not in a funny way- in a sad, I'm-trying-to-escape kind of way. She has a shitty father. But not in a funny way- in a my-daddy-issues-ruin-my-life kind of way. She has an awful relationship with her sister. But not in the way that lends itself to jokes- in an heartbreaking way. (I mean, there's a whole line of jokes on her being a raging bitch to her nephew- how is that funny?) To the surprise of no one ever, she ruins the relationship with Dr. Conners. And to the surprise of everyone, he forgives her. Their relationship was completely unbelievable. She has no redeeming qualities, so I was never rooting for her to \"win\". I seriously didn't care if they got back together and honestly felt like he was being ridiculous for wanting her back. The only time I laughed was when Hader and Lebron were playing basketball while chatting and were so comically mismatched. I realize I'm in the minority, and I'm as surprised as anyone that I didn't happily lap up whatever Apatow put out, but this one was a huge disappointment to me. Seriously it felt like the last half hour of This Is 40, just as an entire movie. A bunch of legimitately sad/serious story lines with a few jokes from athletes spattered clunkily along. ", "I really enjoyed the movie, it did drag in parts (hospital scenes, baby shower, sisters talking about dad in about 6 different scenes) but it wasn't bad and there was always a joke to keep you interested. I actually found I missed Cena and Lebron whenever they weren't in a scene, they were highlights to me.\n\nThe main problem I have with the movie is:\n\n* Amy's not likable in a sense that I believe Aaron falls for her. She's rough around the edges and she doesn't do anything ~~spectacular~~ that I could see him falling for her. It's like he's in love with her because that's how it's written. Maybe his fascination for her stems from him being in such a dry spell?\n* Having a vice means you're broken and in order to be worthy of love you have to be vice free. What a weird puritanical message to throw in at the end of the movie? Having some self control could of been done in a subtler way, maybe just 1 glass of wine at dinner and refusing a second as a for instance?", "I did not find it at all credible that Bill Hader's character was so committed to her, given her \"trainwreck\" lifestyle combined with her bringing nothing to the table in the relationship (not even respect). It felt more like her own self-involved fantasy than a real relationship: \n\n*Slutty girl plays the field until one day perfect successful life-saving doctor man comes along. She dumps her \"meathead\" boy-toys, breaks out a kickass cheerleading routine and wins his heart. You go girl!*", "I really enjoyed it. It was much more of a traditional romantic comedy by the end than I initially expected it to be but with Schumer and Hader's performances and her writing it I think it was vastly superior to most in the genre. It was hilarious throughout and I was bent over with laughter during long stretches.  John Cena and Lebron were awesome and totally unlike they've ever been. One of my favorites of the year. ", "I definitely agree with what everyone has said so far. A tad bit too long, a tad bit too predictable, but really funny. LeBron and Cena were good, so was Marv Albert, but I really didn't like Amy's work conflicts. Just seemed to unoriginal and boring. I would recommend this movie. ", "Honestly, it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time and also had some real depth.  ", "The public and my reception of this movie reminds me of Top Five.  There were some funny moments, particularly around awkward sex, but the batting average on jokes was only around .500.  Thats great in baseball but in a comedy film that's getting such high praise, not so much.  \n\nI found the story to be not only predictable, but bordering on ridiculous.  Aaron is not only a doctor, but as a facsimile for Dr. James Andrews, Orthopedic Surgeon to the Lords of Sport, he'd be the most famous and successful doctor in the world.  There may be plenty of reasons for him to be into a woman like Amy in this film, but *none* of them are explored.  I found her pretty repugnant on many (non-physical) levels.  Not to mention at the end she is basically forced to change all of her ways in order to get the guy.  While some good ideas are there, the more I think about it the less I liked it, and I can't help but feel like there's a much, much, better movie that could have been made with a few changes here and there. \n\nC+", "How's Lebron??

He was the star of this film. He was the funniest he has ever been and he stole every scene he was in. Basically everything he said made me giggle. I\u2019m so happy he was put in the MCU, but I know he won\u2019t have any major roles outside of future Ant-Man films, so that is sad. **Baskin-Robbins always finds out.**\n\n2) I know the popular thing to say about this film is that the villain is not well written, which is a common Marvel issue. That was my main problem with Guardians of the Galaxy, and same with Age of Ultron. I think Yellowjacket blew them both out of the way. He totally made sense to me and all of his actions. Darren Cross had been shit on by Hank Pym for decades. But before that, Hank was basically a mentor to Darren and most likely a friend. But fear of letting the Pym Particles get out, caused him to push everyone away and his daughter.\n\nSo it makes sense for Cross to feel betrayed, like the one man he trusted who knew this amazing secret would refuse to help out his student. Over years of testing he would of course resent Hank and get more and more angry. Add in the mind altering effects of all the testing, which is a bit more of a cop out, then yeah, all of his actions end of the movie make sense. Especially when Hank, after all this time, trusted his secret with what Darren could only see to be a criminal. Darren is a smart man and an almost equal with Hank, but Hank picked a thug over him.\n\nSo of course Darren would flip his shit over all this. It makes even more sense for Darren to attempt to kill Cassie, Scott\u2019s daughter. Hank was like a father to Darren, and Hank replaced Darren with another son. So much like Scott helped ruin his family, Darren wanted to ruin Scott\u2019s family. I think it was brilliant, and Corey Stoll did an excellent job there. Also, you know, the armor and lasers. They were cool too.\n\n\n3) And finally, Evangeline Lilly was awkward in this movie. I know she was supposed to be pissed around her dad, but whenever they interacted, it didn\u2019t feel that good. Chemistry or something was off, and since Douglas is a pretty damn seasoned actor, I want to assume she was the fault? \n\nEither way, I fucking loved Ant-Man, and I don\u2019t care who knows it. I was worried like everyone else about Wright\u2019s departure, but it still succeeded my expectations.

It was my younger brother. When Ant-Man was riding the ants through the water pipe, and he came to the point where he was supposed to get off, how the hell did the ants get in there to form a rope for him to climb up to? My brother's like, \"Hey, if those ants can get in there no problem to help him in, can't he just get in the way they came?\"", "Never in my life did I think I would ever say the words, \"Thomas the Tank Engine was the best part of the movie!\"", "Saw this last night - I'd consider this in the upper half of all MCU movies so far. \n\nRandom thoughts  \n\n* I like how this is a movie about parenthood, specifically about fathers and daughters, with the parallel between Scott and Cassie, and Hank and Hope. I think it added a sense of humanity and relatability to these characters. Very similar to what was done with Hawkeye in Age of Ultron.  The big hitters of the Avengers fight because they have the training and they are essentially superhuman (even Stark who is super intelligent).  Scott is an every-man (granted an every-man with a masters in Electrical Engineering) who happens upon this world, but stays around for his daughter. \n* I like the cinematography tricks used to go between the ant and human sized sequences - notably the bathroom scene when he first shrinks, and the briefcase scene. The editing of Luis's narration was also excellent and a real highlight.\n* Pursuant to the above, the comedic timing of the epic fights taking place on the small scale, juxtaposed against how quiet they really were on the human scale (as we saw in the trailer) really worked for me.  Same goes for blowing things up later on (especially the tank - good use of Chekov's gun there - also it apparently showed up during the footage) \n* Speaking of Luis/Michael Pena - I'm kinda sad that we won't likely see him in another non Ant-man film, because he's a real treat.  Goofy sidekick friend, but he has loads more to him - he enjoys fine art and fine wine, and he apparently is semi-super human - if he's the guy who can always OHKO someone, maybe that's a power? Fingers crossed. \n* I don't think the action in this movie (with the exception of the Falcon fight) was particularly exceptional - not that it was bad.  Just that the heist elements (especially utilizing many kinds of ants, the planning with the three wombats, etc) were so much stronger. If Guardians was a space opera, Cap1 was a historical war piece, Cap2 was a spy thriller, Thor was a fantasy epic, this was a heist.  Makes me excited for what other genres Marvel takes on. \n* If there was a weak point I think it was Hope and Hank's acting - there wasn't much chemistry between the two in my eyes. That said, I'm still super pumped to see the Wasp join the Avengers - did not see that coming at all. Maybe Cassandra Lang will become Stature at some point? \n* Again, not the strongest hero.  But I'd argue that aside from Loki he's probably the second strongest villain - he has a clear motivation (get Hank's approval) that maybe wasn't as strongly shown as much as it was told us.\n* Pacing wise, Overall I think that it did a good job.  Laughs throughout, but not that they would overpower you (similar to Guardians).  The action and fighting wasn't pointless or drawn out.  There were weak spots such as the training montage, and with how quickly Hope/Hank make up or how Hope and Scott fall for each other. \n\nOther small things (mostly Easter Eggs)\n\n* Was kinda cool seeing Anna Akana in a Marvel movie - I was like whoa did not expect to see you in here. Also first Spiderman reference! \n* Cool seeing the original actors for Howard and Peggy in the first scene. \n* Disney continues to show how they are spreading their arms, with Luis whistling \"It's a Small World\" and Yellowjacket's suit making Star Wars noises\n* The Phase 2 homage to Star Wars continues with a character losing an arm.  Here it was Yellowjacket \n* The Microverse scene was hella trippy. Kinda deus ex for him to come back like that, but I guess it works within the film's themes.  Chance we'll see reference to this in the Doctor Strange movie, and maybe a return of the original Wasp then, if that's where she's been all this ime? \n* The Tales to Astonish reference got a laugh out of me \n* Hail Hydra! Also apparently in the footage of Hank as Ant-Man you see a clip with the Ten Rings logo, and one of the buyers has a Ten Rings tattoo on his neck. Ten Rings to appear in Doctor Strange would be my guess. ", "This is the most comic booky Marvel movie yet.

The first half of the movie was remarkably bland for a movie about a guy who can shrink, with a bunch of unremarkable characters. Paul Rudd, funny as he may be, is probably the least interesting protagonist of the MCU. I feel like trying to make him into leading man material you lose a lot of what makes Rudd such a presence in his comedic films. Evangeline Lily is on the sidelines for the whole movie and only purpose is to teach Ant-Man everything she can already do until he is better and then work in a forced romance at the end. The villain is perhaps the worst to date. Outside of the action scenes, the movie looks and feels generic. The story was cliche, and followed all the cliche beats (hero sacrifices himself, comes back because of his daughter's cries, etc). I was surprised at how bored I was at some stages of the movie.\n\nWhat saved the movie for me however is the final action scene. They really used their imagination for the shrinking capabilities both with the action and the gags. Playing Disintegration by The Cure while fighting in a briefcase? Genius. Tank keyring? Awesome. Pet Ant? Sure, why not. It's a shame the rest of the movie wasn't as imaginative with it's story and characters as it was with it's action set pieces, or I would have enjoyed the film a lot more.

Yeah that happens here and it's unacceptable by today's standards for comic book films. Ant Man is exposition up until the last 40 mins where they pull off the big heist.

And in the first 15 minutes when there wasn't much narrative, it was genuinely super funny. Paul Rudd is incredible at improv and it showed. But man the movie really fell apart after that for me. Seeing Edgar Wright's hands all over this movie but without his directorial voice was a huge bummer. The rewrites felt like they just had every character narrate their thoughts to the audience. \"I have a daughter...\" repeatedly/\"I'm done! I'm out of the game...\" repeatedly, or \"I have to shrink between the molecules\" during the climax. Him physically writing out \"377 days till I get to see Cassie.\" \"Become the hero your daughter deserves (etc) (etc).\" I felt like I was constantly being talked at to make sure I understood. It felt so...clunky.\n\nCharacters were a mess. Scott Lang was cool and believable, but beyond that it really went south. Worst of all was Darren Cross. He was a psychopath with no note other than \"conniving and evil.\" He was so entirely void of compassion of any kind, even some warped kind that many of the best villains have, that I didn't care at all about him. \n\nHe brings me to the narrative lapses...He murdered a co-worker! No one is going to investigate this at all? Really? Then Hank Pym used the suit in actual combat, and there is documented footage of soldiers being taken out by a tiny man, and somehow all of this was kept under wraps, even by the soldiers that he took out? Hank was willing to blow up all his life's work? And how did Cross have such a strong grasp on using and fighting in the yellowjacket suit? He had never been shrunk down before until the climactic fight. It was just really sloppy and distracting, which was uncharacteristic for Marvel, for the most part.\n\nThen the direction: sure, Thomas getting huge and the subatomic verse were cool and really inventive, but they were already in the script. I just feel like Peyton Reed knew how to make energetic scenes but there was nothing stand-out about anything he did. The punch outs from the ant-sized fights to show how inconsequential they were were funny, but he just kept banking on them and never was building or changing anything. Edgar Wright is incredible with repeated jokes that keep getting funnier and this was severely missed here.\n\nSo I dunno, it was sort of entertaining, but it just had so many issues that I could never really get into it. Paul Rudd's casting was excellent though, so I hope he's given a better movie to work with in the future. \n\nTL;DR - Funny improv when it happened, and it was nice not seeing buildings get toppled again, but the direction was pretty generic, the characters besides Lang and Pym were pretty weak (especially the villain), and there were a ton of plot holes/logic gaps that got in the way of things.", "It's not comming to my country for another two weeks :(", "Pros:\n\n- Paul Rudd as Ant-Man.

Every line out of his mouth is gold, but I cant really accept him going from Fury and End of Watch to essentially a jokey, Latino caricature.\n\n- Michael Douglas as Hank Pymp\n\n- Evangeline Lilly as Hope is probably like what... one of the three female characters in the MCU with any semblance of complexity?

Great use of depth perception, depth-of-field, space, distance, and humor in the inventive sequences.\n\n- Much more smaller and contained compared to Age of Ultron; this helped it to have identity for itself as opposed to being too much of a plug for future sequels.\n\nCons:\n\n- It was obvious which parts were included by Rudd and McKay's rewrites, since it clashed with everything else and made little sense i.e. the SHIELD prologue, Falcon melee, and Hydra being shoehorned in because it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without fucking Hydra.\n\n- Dun-dun-dun, another one-dimensional Marvel villain bites the dust\n\n- The usual, bland made-for-TV cinematography in non-action scenes despite having Russell Carpenter as the DOP.\n\n- The usual dullard, barely there score\n\nIt's better than Age of Spectacle, but that's probably not saying much.", "I feel like they could've had Scott see a spider when he was small and ask Hank if he could control it and Hank replies with \"No, you're not called spider man\"", "This movie looked like it was shot as a TV/Direct to DVD film.

Even the direction was really satisfying to watch, the cinematography, the percussive cuts like in the scene with the street band, the camera movement, I was excited.\n\nAnd then it felt like they switched directors at the second act.  A movie that could have been about exploring the concept of self and what makes you *you* was pretty much non-existent.  It became a chase movie with some inexplicable Jason Bourne elements that had switching bodies in the background as window dressing.  It really could have been about anything. Ryan Reynolds could have stolen some jewels, or had national secrets, or anything to get him on the run and it would have only been *slightly* different.\n\nI also didn't know enough about any of the characters to really care about them.  The original guy that Damian takes over is never shown (until the last scene) so the gravity of him losing himself is never felt on emotional level. We don't spend *that* much time with Old Damian, and Ryan Reynolds didn't really play New Damian to feel like the same character, so I just really didn't care if he stayed in the body or faded.\n\nBesides, as soon as he figured out it was someone else's body (which I wish they didn't reveal in the trailer), the moral choice was pretty clear.  One is an old guy who lived a full life, but was a terrible father. The other was a young dad who sacrificed his life to save his daughter.  Which consciousness deserved Ryan Reynold's body? \n\nSo the whole thing to me felt unexplored, predictable, and without any real weight.

Just didn't feel like a real relationship. I was waiting for the awesome line where Ryan Reynolds is getting choked up and says he has to leave now.

He gets chocked up and rushes out, maybe cries on the sidewalk.\n\nThen, he is just gone. The real \"Ryan\" wakes up in bed and watches the computer video. How did they not film a final scene of him coping with the fact that he was essentially killing himself? Show him crying as he finally dumps the pills down the drain or something. It was so damn abrupt.\n\nFinally, the last scene. Ryan just shows up and is like, \"Oh, I'm Mark now for real.\" The end. \nBull. fucking. shit.\nThis woman has been through so much. She's seen her husband reincarnated as a new man, children being \"shedded\", death, etc, etc. And she just takes this whole, \"I'm the real Mark\" thing with no hesitation?\n\nHave a scene where Mark is happy to see her, but she hesitantly pushes her away. She doesn't know what to believe and Mark doesn't really know how to deal with it. Then, Mark sees his daughter in the water, and realizes he never got to teach her to swim. Have him run into the water, fully clothed, so happy to see his daughter. As he embraces her, he asks if she finally wants to learn how to swim. Cut to a reaction shot of the wife, hopeful that it's the real Mark. Cut back to the daughter, as she replies, \"You already taught me daddy\". The daughter embraces Mark, happy and oblivious. Cut to a reaction of Mark as they are hugging, uncertain of his recent past and his near future. Cut to black.\n\nThat seemed like it would have been a much better ending. Just needing to be more thought out.\n\nOh, and why the hell did he torch the bad guy? Does he not realize that the body is just a vessel, and seemingly an innocent person? I feel like it would have been much more awesome to have them in a fist fight or something, only to have the villain be like, \"Kill me if you want. This body is merely a vessel.\" and have Ryan conflicted with whether he can kill an innocent body or not. Perhaps in the end, he decides he has to kill him anyways, as there is not other solution. Once he's blown his brains out, Ryan is teared up, dealing with the death of an \"innocent\" person (however, this doesn't work that well, with how much action there was in this movie already).

But while Penguins of Madagascar had a continuous story with Private, which fed into the themes as WELL as the plot, there barely seemed to be any theme at all, less alone anything continuous. The Minions were 'leader, lazy musician one and cute little one' and that was sort of it. I'm not really sure what it was all 'about', but i guess kids don't care too much and the little yellow bastards remain endearing all the same. \n\nHowever when the main characters can't speak we are left with the supporting humans to carry what is left and it was serviceable at best.\n\nScarlett Overkill is actually pretty great, and Bullock plays her pretty well, but she's so one-note... and strangely flat in places. Also, her one desire was to...  steal the British Crown? When a film is TRULY out of ideas they go to the Big Grab Bag of Lazy Story Settings. Maybe it's a Spy Thriller (Cars 2/Penguins of Madagascar), or some kind of Road Trip, or maybe a heist or some fucking shit - but sometimes it's 'Character becomes Royalty' or some other ill formed idea of the like. They did that one. \n\nAdd to that the bizarre amount of 60s references (aimed at the GRANDPARENTS?) - why did they think kids would like it? \n\nJon Hamm was an appealing presence, but I didn't really understand why Scarlett had a warm, loving marriage with a cool, easy going, relaxed guy (that was kind of his entire presence) when everything else about her was sort of geared towards her barely holding in an insane rage. Gru's evil engineer dude was much better in the other films and had some kind of motivation. Any kind of motivation would have been nice.\n\nThe previous two movies were not amazing, but they had some heart. They had a story and themes. \n\nBut fuck it - it's a kid's movie, right? Who cares! Fuck the story. Fuck well written characters with motivation. Kids films don't need to have any of that. Except Inside Out exists - and proves that you really SHOULD aim higher, even if it's 'just a kids movie'. \n\nAnd fuck that noise. If it was 'just a kids movie' there would be no references to the 60s, or the hot tub threesome, or the butler walking in on Scarlett Overkill and husband with the suggestion he's just walked in on them fucking.

It was romantic, but there were no kissing scenes and no dying words of love.  It was funny, but didn't try too hard.  There was this moment when Greg is talking about leukemia and he clearly has no idea what the disease is.  I think in another movie like this, it might not have been like that.  It's not that it would have made it a bad movie otherwise (kind of a minor moment, really), it just made it feel more real, like the teenagers in the movie act like actual teenagers that aren't prepossessed of some adult-like wisdom or knowledge.  I really liked everything about this movie, but that's the part that stuck out to me the most, the part that will stay with me: they did an excellent job of not overdoing it, which is easy to do when you're telling a story about a cancer-ridden teenager.  \n", "There were parts of this movie that were some of the most enjoyable and funny things I've seen in a movie this year. The parodies of classic films, especially ***Blue Velvet***, ***Contempt***, and ***Midnight Cowboy***, were just hilarious and delightful. All of the leads and supporting characters and performances were fantastic, the music was nice, and the camerawork and atmosphere were strange and intoxicating. The Steadicam scene with Greg on the phone having an awkward conversation while Bickle's awkward phone call scene in ***Taxi Driver*** plays in the background was so well done and just a delight to see executed. The long take of Rachel and Greg getting into an argument was beautifully acted and directed. My only gripes would be with the handling of Greg and Earl's film for Rachel. I'm not somebody that argues that the movie should be exactly like the book, but Greg's film he shows to Rachel in the movie just didn't look as passionately made or funny like it was in the book. Sure, the film they made in the book wasn't amazing, but you could tell it had more care behind the camera than the one in the movie. Plus, Earl wasn't even there. I get that this was done because of Greg's narcissism, but the way the sequence's cut and played out doesn't even give you a solid idea of what's going on. This whole sequence fell really flat for me, but it didn't ruin all of the other parts for me. I think anyone that loves movies should check it out.

Also, Nick Offerman was hilarious although his performance was pretty minor.\n\n* The Camera work\n\nI really liked it. Especially the long shot when (Spoilers) Rachael decides to go off treatment.  There were many other mesmerizing shots in the movie as well, but that one had stuck out to me for some odd reason.\n\n* The Realism of the subject\n\nThis is a subject that a lot of movies fail to capture and that's what it's like to see someone go through having such a terrible disease. Having experience someone go through it as well, I really appreciate how the movie had portrayed it.  \n\n* The Movie Parodies\n\nEven if you don't like this movie as a whole, I feel you would enjoy the parody sequences. It was very awesome to see hilarious copies of classic cinema.\n\n\nThe Cons\n\n* Greg as a character \n\nWith a movie that has some pretty great characters, something about Greg just really annoyed me. I actually thought he was perfectly fine until the latter half of the movie, then he got kind of obnoxious.\n\n* The Writing in the Third Act\n\nSome of the foreshadowing was very blatant. When the history teacher was talking about finding more about his father after passing, it was very obvious it would come together in the end after Rachael died. Also the rapping guy was very annoying and I felt if you removed all conflicts that involved that character the movie wouldn't change at all.\n\nNot my best review, but I think this a pretty great movie 8/10\n\n[Here's the full list of the movies they parody](http://caramiezone.blogspot.ca/2015/05/movies-me-and-earl-and-dying-girl.html)", "I know I'm late to the party, but I knew I had to post something after seeing this movie.

A lot of them are plot holes for the planned trilogy.\n\nHowever, they even say Skynet could never win no matter what it tried so that is why it ended up trying to attack John and converting him to a machine.  John was the key to the equation for Skynet.\n\nI don't get the hate on him being turned into a machine.  It makes sense because Skynet was basically out of options.  Every time a Terminator was sent back in time it failed somehow.  Skynet just couldn't get rid of its rival.\n\nNow the timeline is extremely messed up because we now have a 70's conflict on top of 84'.  In 84 they destroyed the T-1000 and destroyed the T-800 so this obviously delays the arrival of Skynet. Thus Skynet being created as a social media platform is somethign I buy.  I have no problem with this because there is no technology to speed up its creation until John goes back to 2014 and helps Cyberdyne.  Now in 2017 they completely bypassed the T-800 model and started with liquid metal.  Technology that John obviously gave Cyberdyne.  However, they say in the movie that they can't function because they don't have a chip.  Since the T-800 hasn't been created there is no chip technology yet that could be evolved or used to power the liquid metal.  John not being able to jump to the future isn't a plot hole because they used the T-800's chip in 84 and subsequently destroyed it.  There was no chip yet in 2017.  Skynet developed the T-800 and the subsequent chip technology.  Not humans.  They only create the AI that makes Skynet possible.  \n\nHowever, now in 2017 since they are skipping the T-800 model they have to wait for Skynet to create the chips to power the technology.  Theres no plot hole here if you really look at what is happening in this alternate timeline.\n\nJohn even says to Arnold that he is a relic of a dead timeline or something to that effect. Essentially saying that the T-800 and any model before never even went into production and was ultimately skipped for a more superior killing machine.\n\nI will say I hate Jai Courtney and thought he was horribly cast, but I did enjoy the movie overall.  Even Emilia Clarke has a few scenes where I could really see her as Linda Hamilton.  The problem with her character is she is not exactly T-2 Sarah and not T-1 Sarah.  She's somewhere inbetween.\n\nI apologize if I ran in circles on some of my logic on this movie.  I'm just enjoying having seen the movie and having a couple beers.  I'm a fan of the franchise and I thought this movie ranks behind 1 and 2 easily.  Also I mean come on the biggest plot hole ever for this series is that a machine was sent back first.  If the machine was sent back first the machines win because Kyle never has a chance to save Sarah because everything would happen instantaneously in the future.  Game over. No movie.

If not, then how did he get there?\n\nI liked that they stayed in 1984 for only the beginning of the movie, then they jumped forward to 2017. In hindsight, I should've realized it, since in the trailers Arnie looks older in some parts than others. \n\nI was also surprised at how little there was of Matt Smith.

I tell people that if they apply too much logic to a movie they're going to have a bad time. But this had plot holes that just weren't ignorable. It had the most glaring & unavoidable plot holes I've ever seen in a movie. \n\n* How the hell do Sarah & the Guardian build their own time machine in a sewer in 1984 but Cyberdyne can't quite finish theirs in 2017, even with help from future John Connor augmented with nanomachines?\n\n* Why would there be an argument about 1997 or 2017? Why risk going to 2017 where Judgement Day could have already happened? Why not just go to 1997, see how things are, then wait it out for 20 years? The story behind the first 25% of the movie was Sarah & the Guardian waiting, planning, & preparing meticulously for over 10 years. So why even need to time travel at all? And why did they have to go RIGHT NOW?? Why not take some time to figure out their options. I know that they need to have Sarah & Kyle looking young 30 years in the future, but it doesn't forgive the very poor writing. \n\n* The Guardian mentioned he was part of the construction crew that built the Cyberdyne complex but was \"laid off\". What??? Well then why not sabotage the place as it's being built?! Instead he stockpiles enough weapons for a small army knowing very well it's just 3 people. Why would they even be loading ammo when they arrive if he's been waiting for 33 years? Why go to the trouble of planting bombs the day Genisys goes online when he could have planted things over the course of **3 decades**??\n\n* Finally, we were never given answers to who sent the Guardian in the first place. Or any real background to that situation. Is the T-1000 that was sent to 1973 the same as in 1984? I get they can tackle this in a sequel, but I thought it was *major* information that had to be told. I kept thinking, \"they're gonna use that for a plot twist!\"... nothing.\n\nOverall I hated the movie, hated the casting & performances, & hated the concept behind Genisys.

This film, unlike T3 and T4, seemed to have care and some attention-to-detail to the film. How they mirrored some of the scenes from the previous films, right down to how they frame the shot. Moments like these made me squeal. I loved how they didn't seem to crowbar in any of the references from previous films, they seemed to be appropriate for the situation. The action and dramatic sequences were tensed, they were well shot (i.e no overuse of shaky cam) and and had my heart racing at times.\nAnother thing I loved is that this movie, despite its lore-breaking plot point [Spoiler](* \"where John is a Terminator\"), is that it actually tries to stay close to the source material. Not in its in cinematography but for once its themes.\n\nI felt the first sequence was more exciting than the entire movie of Salvation. They constructed the battles wonderfully at least compared to previous films. It really did evoke a sense of the danger the machines presented very well. \n\nMy thoughts on the ending. [Spoiler](* \"Aside from the lame sequel baiting sequence post-credits which I did not consider canon, I think the ended on a good note. There are some things that I wish went a bit differently but it ended well. In fact the only reason why I saw the post-credit sequence was I was discussing with my friends during the credits how I was actually blown away on how good this movie is\")\n\nThis movie isn't without its faults. I'm not sure if it was the direction, or Jai Courtney but I felt that he lacked the same intensity as Michael Biehn. Aside from the other lore breaking stuff [Spoiler](* \"like how John Connor is a Terminator\"), I think the movie made the most with what it had. There were some lame things that happened but I feel they are not enough to detract from the movie.\n\nFantastic movie. It's a disgrace that this movie is critically panned because it's much, much, infinitely better than T3 and T4 because it wants to be close to the source material. Not only in its attention-to-detail but to James Cameron's themes.\n\ntl;dr The critics don't know what they are talking about.\n\nEdit:infinitesimally fixed. ", "After the movie ended my friends and I agreed it would have been way cooler if they just stayed in the 80s and remade the first movie with the alternate timeline stuff thrown in. How cool would it have been seeing the Older T-800 fighting the fresh one (I guess we did see that, but i mean in a more cat and mouse sense like the first movie) we saw at the lake scene(which made little sense to me btw, did he blow up the cabin? he had a rocket launcher). Instead we got a mess of story elements thrown together with no stakes attached and your standard CGI set pieces. I know the phrase \"unintentionally funny\" get thrown around a lot here but that helicopter scene was hilarious, it looked like a cartoon. Also, Matt Smith is kind of in this movie, but it feels to me like they cut a lot of his stuff, and the John Conner turn was poorly explained, he was literally just turned evil. At least the editing wasn't frantic and you could tell what was going on, and Jason Clarke was good. C-", "Is there anyone here who's never seen the original films like me and enjoyed the film just fine?", "FX were good, and what they tried to do with the story fit within the franchise. This movie didn't attack the Terminator you already know... this movie attacked itself. A few times I caught myself trying to put together what they just explained, and realized I was missing what was going on right then. The times they tried to be funny weren't worth half a laugh. Final Verdict: I've seen worse.\n\nAlso, the T-800 has arthritis. I wish that was a joke, but it happened.", "Rotten Tomatoes score is an outrage, how the hell did anyone find this to be WORSE than Salvation?\n\nI thought it was an entertaining flick, creative story, fun ride. Wasn't going to reach the highs of T2 and T1 but never really tried to. Clearly Arnold's last hurrah though, since the ratings are so low and the Box Office is probably also gonna stink.", "I understand the plot holes, but overall I think the movie was not that bad. Arnold gives a great performance for what we have seen lately. Action was good and some of the jokes are funny. Honestly the biggest reason I liked it was because I think they understood were the first two came from. It's an action movie and it does that well. If you are looking for clever plots and extraordinary action don't watch a Summer Blockbuster, because you won't get that from Genisys. Overall 6.5/10", "When the COPS theme started playing I lost all respect I might of had for the movie.", "I really enjoyed it, I went in expecting to see a retelling of T1 & T2 but halfway through it turned into a cool original \"sequel\". The bad thing about it though is when it switches there's very little time left in the movie to expand and develop the \"new movie\". I was left wanting more of this new story and the villain. \n\nThe ending kinda made no room for a sequel but I'm kinda hopeful there is one with these actors. The movie didn't suffer from the PG-13 rating and I almost forgot about it really soon into the film, the action was great, f-bombs and cursing if that's what you wnt and no need for gore. It had quite a bit of humor and most of the jokes were hits with the theater I saw it with.\n\nOne thing I was scared of was the whole time travel within time travel plot but it did a good job explaining the changes and what was going on. Overall, a solid fun movie and a great companion piece to the originals not really a sequel. 8/10", "I liked it. I didn't have huge expectations going in after they spoiled it in the trailer but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.\n\nI wish there had been some sort of redemption for John Connor.

", "It felt like someone watched all of the movies and tried to figure out what separated the good ones from the bad ones and tried to make a movie with all the good parts (rather than just trying to create a good story). What we got was more of Arnold being a robot not understanding social rules, an even crazier Terminator-model and even wackier time travel. The individual parts were good but the movie couldn't hold them up (and let's not even get into Jai Courtneys acting...).\n\nIn the end I didn't enjoy the movie much, even though I really wanted to, but my friends really did. I guess it's one of those movies where some, but not all, will be able to look past the glaring flaws and enjoy the good fun that's in there.", "I enjoyed it.

Maybe the worst casted blockbuster I can remember", "Absolutley despised this movie, I'm actually fine with the concept and even John Conner becoming a villian but the execution in every aspect of filmmaking just utterly fails.\n\nEven taking away 1984 nitpicks like the punks hairstyles/face makeup being wrong, Kyle's bum pants not having paint on them, the bum not wearing yoga pants underneath, Kyle getting the striped shirt from the store when he didn't in the original, Kyles barcode laser scan being black when it was actually red, the film just lacks good writing and direction that a film like Terminator requires.\n\nThe action scenes just lack that kinetic energy that the first two had and films like Fury Road or The Raid pull off. There's no tension in the action scenes, no buildup or structure, not enough investment in character, the fact that they butchered Kyle Reese who is one of my favourite characters of all time and one of the most complex action heroes ever just really grinds my gears.\n\nI think a lot of the problems go down to poor writing, I felt like Emilia Clarke did the best she possibly could with what she was given, however the writing for her character was tonally inconsistent. One second she's wisecracking and a being a smartass, the next minute she's agressive and emotionless, then suddenly she shows some human side, and it just throws off her overall perfomance.\n\nTo me the best course of action should've been to stay in 1984 the entire movie, and have John go back to that year and cause some technological revolution in '84, fastracking Skynets development by decades, it would've helped the flow of the film and you could have the T-1000 be in the film for longer instead of him being disposed immediately so they can move the plot forward.\n\nAnother thing I really hated was the tone of the film. It felt like a Marvel movie which is not necessarily a bad thing, but for the Terminator film series this is a no go imo. I don't want to see the three main characters be wise cracking smart asses and sacrificed character development to do so. Don't even get me started on that Bad Boys gag.\n\nIt's a shame that a film series in which once reinvented and innovated the art of blockbuster filmmaking is now been reduced to a mere carbon copy of tent pole movies of late.\n\nEDIT: Formatting and grammar.", "Way to fuck up a great franchise.....this is the Batman Forever...... Terminator version.\n\nTo be honest I did not expect much from this movie and I am sad to say I was correct. I remember seeing the first one in the theater as a child....T2 as teen (wow what a movie)....it just went down hill from there. I could tell the budget was not there for a great plot....all of it was spent on the effects. I could not wait for it to be over. This movie makes me sad.", "I rewatched all the films and TSCC leading up to this. Only saw first trailer for Gensisys so I was somewhat unspoiled. The first trailer made me think it was going to be almost like Back to the Future II in subverting the canon of the earlier films, which I was game for. I was excited enough to buy advance tickets for last night's early show and was really looking forward to it.\n\nI really enjoyed the prologue that was set in the future, and I was on board with Genisys mostly for the first act or so. Great action setpiece with the T-1000 and the tone was fun. Then it started to unravel storywise when they jumped forward. The John Connor stuff was insane in a way that made absolutely zero sense. I get that it's a movie and a fictional world, but the Terminator series has been pretty good about establishing rules and working within them. The series has been far from dumb, and big dumb fun was all this movie had going for it past the first act. By the end, with its Resident Evil, evil-computer-as-a-child riff, I was starting to get angry.\n\nI know some people like that the slate is wiped clean going forward. In my opinion, if they wanted to tell a completely new story, do it with new or a few returning characters. Don't reunite every major character from the series and unravel a strong series mythology.\n\nMy ranking of the franchise, from best to worst:\n\n* T2: Judgment Day\n* The Terminator\n* Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\n* T3: Rise of the Machines\n* Terminator Salvation\n* Every extended universe novel and comic\n* Every piece of Terminator fan fiction ever written\n* Terminator Genisys\n\nI'm morbidly curious what they have planned for the rest of this new trilogy, but I'll be surprised if it actually happens.", "I liked it! It was fun and entertaining. The plotholes were there, but they didn't ruin the entire movie for me. I didn't really like the nickname Pops. The T800 was awesome though, he had a lot of hero moments, and him fighting his younger self was just too good :)", "So did this movie just *Days of Future Past* the entire Terminator Franchise? Are the old movies no longer relevant anymore? Holy shit! I went in expecting a Terminator film and got exactly what I wanted. Definitely killed any sequel beyond T2, those which I somewhat loved more than probably most. Upon seeing the title and the kind of spoilery movie poster, I thought it honestly was going to be shit, but I loved it for what it was worth. \n\nSeeing Emilia Clarke in a role like this was pretty interesting, but in the back of my mind I kept thinking of MOTHER OF DRAGONS, now being MOTHER OF TIME TRAVEL. I felt that Jai was an ok Kyle Reese but couldn't touch the original. Arnold was classic Arnold in this, as he has been in all the other Terminator films.\n\nMan, I have so many questions about this film, starting first off if this movie didn't even acknowledge Terminator Salvation. Didn't they destroy Skynet in that one, or just severely damaged it? The big question maybe on everyone's minds (or possibly just me not connecting the dots yet) is who sent back Arnold to save 9 year old Sarah Connor. A final question would be where the story leads now. Do they open the *hidden* files or codes in Arnold's brain and we have a situation like in Judgment Day where he goes against John Connor? Does yet another Skynet arise? Does Skynet go back even further?\n\nMan, what a perfect summer film.

I would have liked to see more ASAP. ", "**Semi-spoilers ahead, nothing that'll ruin the film experience for you**\n\nI loved *Dope*, and think it's an important film, here's why:\n\n1. The plot is roughly centered around Malcolm, Jib, and Diggy's failure to fit into the stereotype for their colored \"hood\" background, and the film's humor comes from the idea that these kids who culturally \"should\" (heavy air quotes) know what to do in a situation where they wind up with a ton of drugs don't. I **love** this because it's the only place where race really comes in. *Dope* is a film that does a lot with race, but none of it is heavy-handed, and none of it isolates its audience. I saw someone on Reddit describe Dope as a \"black Wes Anderson\" movie and it riled me up as much as seeing it described as a \"black coming-of-age film\" or even a \"black film\" at all. It's a movie. It's beautifully shot and the cinematography is phenomenal. The costume design is on the nose. The music is wonderful. The acting is great. It's a fantastic **movie**, full stop. And this movie uses race in a way that doesn't isolate or alienate the audience.\n\n2. Speaking of the audience, I love how the movie treats its audience as intelligent. When Will (Blake Anderson) has a conversation with the main cast about why he's \"not allowed to say the n-word\" it's hilarious. And the reason it's hilarious is because the film trusts the audience to have a base understanding of how wildly inappropriate and insensitive Will is being. We're laughing *at Will* here, and it makes all the difference in the world. \n\n3. Malcolm's end monologue straight up gave me goosebumps. The editing combined with Shameik's voicework combined with the sound editing created one of the most poignant 5-minute scenes I've seen about being a black youth in America today. More than that, this is the only time the movie gets heavy-handed. Getting back to my first point, this movie isn't a \"black coming-of-age film\", it's just a film about a boy's journey in self-discovery. Black has nothing to do with it. But when it becomes the focal point, the film doesn't shy away from heading in that direction head-on, head-strong, and making a **lot** of sense while doing it. Honestly, the line \"Why do I want to go to Harvard? If I were white would you even be asking that question?\" as he puts on a hoodie to head to a convenience store said just the right amount and gave me a lot to chew on during the ride home.\n\n4. It treats humorous situations with the right amount of levity, and always treats gang violence, guns, and the reality of living in such a crime-filled area with an extremely serious and sometimes scary lens. Kids selling drugs on the internet is funny in this movie. But when one picks up a gun, you feel his world drop away. Rick Famuyiwa has excellent direction here. He knows what he wants to say, how to say it, and how much to say. We don't need any dialogue once Malcolm picks up a gun, at that point we *feel* as much as Malcolm could ever say: what does this say about him; is he just another gangster from the streets; can he ever differentiate himself from his background. And in an instant we wonder if he can. And on a positive note, the film delivers the answer.\n\nEDIT: To sum up what I mean about being poignant but not beating you over the head, the monologue that went straight to him putting on a hoodie and walking into a convenience store was the *exact right amount* we needed to see. It struck me at that moment of the film (especially plot structure wise) that Malcolm could be killed at any moment entirely unrelated to the plot of the film. All of this work and story structure and **blam** wrong place wrong time..\n\n**tl;dr: This is a smart, funny, fast coming-of-age film that also has as much to do with blackness and identity as you let it.

I'm a black kid in a white neighborhood that gets straight A's, and listens to music all the time (not much 90s though) and it was refreshing to be able to relate to the main characters of the movie. I though Shameik Moore did excellent as well as his two sidekicks and Zoe Kravitz. I liked A$AP's role too (especially when I saw Ferg and the whole mob) even though his acting wasn't great. Tyga was awful though tbh. Best role in the movie definitely goes to Blake Anderson though. Hilarious.\n\nAnyway, my problem with this movie is that it's trying to do too many things at once. It's a coming of age movie, a guy trying to get a girl movie, and a statement movie. The end is just too convoluted. At the end of Malcom's essay, you'd think the movie would be over. But, instead Nakia's storyline has to be finished. \nIt also gets jumbled around the middle with Jaleel, the two bloods, Lily, and Will. And maybe there were too many plugs to things popular today (molly, Bitcoin, Vine, Beats headphones, even drones)\n\nAnyway, I thought the movie was hilarious and did make some powerful statements. These two factors overcome the problems that it has. I'd rate it a 8.5 and would recommend that you watch it if you haven't!", "What did the line of code on the computer (near the end) say?

I never saw the trailer until after the movie, but the TV spots that were on left me with a different impression of what this movie was going to be like and about.

Notably the game boy scene at the beginning - going for laughs when I thought it was inappropriate. There were some other scenes too that seemed liked they were played up for laughs when it should have been a bit more serious.  I know it's a comedy, but it went overboard at times taking me out of it in a way that Superbad, for example, didn't.\n\nI also agree with some of the reviewers talking about the stereotypes in the film, interesting that a movie about a black kid getting into Harvard has to involve him dealing drugs.

Some things I noticed that were especially meaningful to me:\n\n* I noticed, when seeing the HQs of other people, it was interesting to see that the emotions operated more in harmony with eachother and things seemed more organized with older characters whereas the emotions in Riley's HQ were constantly at odds, fighting over the controls. It was an interesting way to display maturity without hitting the viewer over the head.\n\n* The emotions in control of the HQs for Mom and Dad were especially interesting. Dad's HQ was run by Anger and Mom's was Sadness. I don't think it was because Riley's Dad had anger issues or her mom was unhappy all the time but more that those emotions matured over time to be something more than the base emotions of Anger, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Joy (they also never referred to eachother by name, meaning that they could have easily been more complex emotional states).\n\n* The overarching metaphor of old memories falling to the wayside, being \"dumped\" in favor of new ones, the islands that made up her younger personality crumbling and being replaced by new \"core memories\" and islands to make her a more complete and mature person.

When the darkness starts to sweep across the control panel, I saw that as a metaphor for depression, as well as when Joy says something along the lines of, \"If we can't get back to headquarters she won't be able to feel anything anymore.\" They depict depression as a lack of emotion rather than too much sadness.\n\nI also like that there's no obvious antagonist.

When Bing Bong first popped up, I immediately thought he was going to be a stock villain of some sort and was delightfully surprised to find out he was just the opposite.

We're in Riley's perspective and Riley is too young to understand these things. So the audience doesn't get to know either.

This movie trusts we (and Riley) understand this... but it doesn't change the situation.\n\nMy biggest thought coming out of this was \"I don't want a sequel. I want a Disney Channel animated series like Buzz Lightyear, Emperors New School and the like\".\n\nThey laid down enough of a universe and enough characters to make Riley's every day life interesting enough for us to watch without every story being epic in scale and nature.

To fully realize the mind and bring to life imagination, a thought train, day dreams, the islands of your personality, and finally being able to break down the mental thought process when you are ultimately struggling.

Anger, Fear, and Disgust, who have only ever played support to Joy's overbearing desire to maintain happiness at all times, are suddenly left in charge.\n\nOn another it's a coming of age story as the girl, Riley, faces the trauma of moving to a new city and a new school. She misses her friends, hates her new room, is jealous of the girl who replaced her on her hockey team, and feels pressured to maintain a happy facade so as not to upset her stressed-out parents.\n\nOn another level it's a deceptively sophisticated illustration of how the mind works. The plot revolves around the complex relationships between emotions, memories, personality, and behavior. The bulk of the movie's humor comes from in-jokes about the quirks of human psychology, like how a jingle from a gum commercial gets stuck in our head, or how the only US Presidents you can remember are \"Washington, Lincoln, and the fat one.\"\n\nAnd on yet another level it demonstrates the difficulty of interpersonal relationships. We're each stuck in our own internal world and can only ever access another person's mind indirectly through their words and social cues.

While Joy was Riley's emotional leader, her mother's leader was Sadness and her father's leader was Anger. Really lended itself to the difference between children and adults and the dominance of each feeling as we age. \n\nAs a guy, I could really relate to the Anger being the leader in my head and I teared up wondering when in my life Joy was no longer the primary way I deal with things.

Had a few parents and kids in my viewing that were not ready,  and let us just say for some of this movie Anger was at the controls.", "I know I'm kinda late to the party, but here's my hefty review for this that I already posted in /r/truefilm. Part of it is just on Pixar bouncing back in general.\n\nI am someone who has grown up on Pixar. Its films are probably some of the most integral films from my childhood. Toy Story was my first movie in theaters. I remember it fondly. I would even say it sparked my imagination and influenced much of it. A Bug's Life did much the same--the set design captivated me as a kid with the way they used objects that we disregard as important parts of their society. Toy Story 2 carried on the nostalgia from Toy Story, and Monsters Inc. almost helped me overcome my fear of my closet. It taught me that sometimes, things that seem scary aren't scary at all. I was even afraid to go see it because there were monsters in it. (As a kid, I'd jump at just about anything.) Finding Nemo showed me a parents perspective on the world from the view of a clownfish.\n\nAnd then came The Incredibles. Its what I consider one of the movies that changed everything for me. Everything from the storyline, to the characters, the editing, cinematography and music made me fully aware of everything that takes place in a movie. I also identified deeply with the character Violet, who was a character roughly my age and with my exact personality at the time. To this day, it holds a spot as one of my top three favorite films.\n\nAfter that came films that were in my teens--Cars was fun, Ratatouille an amazing character piece, WALL-E a film that catered directly to me as it might as well been called Ben Burt's Robots. (I love the sound and droids of Star Wars). As we all know, Up was a tale on life slipping away too fast, and Toy Story 3 came out the year I graduated high school. The timing could not have been more appropriate and resonated more deeply. After Toy Story 3, if it weren't for the rash of lower reviews from critics I would surely question that perhaps I was outgrowing Pixar. What happened to the films that struck a chord with me? I entirely passed on Cars 2, and Brave was good, but felt more like a Disney movie to me. Monsters University was fun and again, aimed directly at my demographic, but I felt no real desire to ever watch it again.\n\nMany doubted Pixar would ever recover, but I remembered back to the year 2010 where I took a look at several of Pixar's films in development. One was Newt--a film that I'm sad that will never happen. Another was The Good Dinosaur, due for release later this year and that sounded really intriguing. And the last one was one that really caught my attention. A film about the emotions inside a girl's head. Ever since then, I've been eagerly awaiting its release. I worried that Pixar would fail to deliver; that this could be a mediocre or poorly reviewed film, and after that it might just be enough for people to lose faith in the studio forever. But I didn't want Inside Out to just be a great film, I wanted it to be one that hit me on a personal level, one that made me look inside myself and learn something, or look back on something in my past. And that's exactly what it did.\n\nThe film opens on Riley being born. Joy is the first to arrive at the helm of Riley's mind, and its clear from the first moment that she loves to make Riley happy. But then Sadness shows up, and its obvious that the two will butt heads for the duration of the movie. It isn't even two minutes in to the film and I can already tell where things are headed. About 15 minutes in, Joy did something that confirmed my initial suspicions. She drew a circle around Sadness and told her to stay there.\n\n**Riley was repressing her feelings.**\n\nSo at this point, Riley has arrived at her new home and tried hard to hold up under the stress of everything. Joy is doing her best to make sure of that. But that isn't necessarily a good thing--the other emotions aren't coping well with the extensive environmental change. Fear doesn't know what day to day life will bring anymore, Disgust hates the stuffy city, Sadness expects the worst, and Anger is straight up mad about the fact that they moved.\n\nThis is where the Pixar film does what I hoped it would do--it reigned me back into my childhood, but not in the way I expected. Many of us went to a new school in our lives, and if you didn't, you still probably switched from elementary to middle school and to high school. Its terrifying as a child. Its like your whole world is falling apart. Both for me and for the character Riley, this very much was a core memory. I was a tad older than Riley when I went from being homeschooled to entering the public school system. I was painfully shy and felt like a total social outcast. I even went days where I wouldn't say a word. My first day of public school is vivid in my memory--a rainy day (in Arizona, mind you) that felt like the end of my life. I might not have moved across the country as Riley did, but the feeling of being completely out of one's environment was captured perfectly in the scene--the emotions running amuck in her head, not knowing at all what to do or how to act. The scene instantly brought back this feeling for me. I knew exactly what Riley was going through.\n\nThis causes the emotions in her head to go into chaos, with a core memory now being one of sadness. Its at this point that Joy and Sadness, in their struggle, are sucked into a memory tube and carried out of Headquarters, leaving the other emotions to keep Riley going.\n\nIts at some point in adolescence that we are thrust into an unfamiliar situation. Some have rougher childhoods than others, and some have better childhoods like Riley's. Loving parents, great friends, and a passion for something--Riley's being hockey. She is a kid that's had a fairly smooth life so far, and this is the first big bump in the road for her. As kids, with such little life experience, we don't know how to react, and like in Inside Out, we don't know how we're supposed to feel.\n\nMy middle school years were rough, and for me that snowballed into high school. I kept suppressing my own Sadness; thinking crying was a weakness and that I should always try to be happy. But by the time I realized I wasn't happy, I had become depressed. And I didn't feel anything at all anymore.\nRiley is heading down much the same road through the rest of the movie, with the things that meant so much to her not seeming to matter anymore. One by one, the islands fall off. Goofball island, her sense of humor. She feels she's lost her friends, then her passion of hockey, her honesty, and lastly, her family. Throughout the film, it's basically a race against the clock for her emotions to save her before she falls into depression.\n\nIts a horrifying moment when Anger, Disgust, and Fear realize that this is happening. Riley is feeling empty as she runs away from home, feeling she's lost everything that matters to her. But during their journey back to Headquarters, Joy has come to the revelation that Sadness does have a purpose. That during a stressful time, a person just needs to have a moment and be sad. Its not a bad thing--its a necessary thing. And that often in times of sadness, others will empathize and be there for the one who feels it.\n\n**Sometimes, as human beings, we need to cry.**\n\nAs a kid, this can be hard to understand. It certainly was for me. As an adult looking back, I am reminded of the turmoil I felt as a child during my harder childhood moments. They aren't pleasant memories, but they have shaped who I am, and I am a stronger person because of it. Its part of growing up.\n\nPixar took a situation that is rather common and troublesome for kids, and turned it into a movie. And they did a damn good job.\n\nInside Out is one of those films where there's so much going on that I'll have to watch it multiple times to catch everything. I spent some time thinking how to approach a review, and I know I don't explore other parts of the movie much, but the movie as a whole was entertaining to me. I loved the humor--like Riley having earworm with the gum commercial song, or the more subtle things, like the newspapers Anger would read. The world building done inside Riley's mind was fantastic and complex. I felt as though I was seeing something I hadn't seen before. Lastly, Michael Giacchino did another amazing score for Pixar. He created yet another theme that in years will be nostalgic for me. Even in my review, I didn't even begin to cover the complexity of this movie. All in all, I'm happy to say that Pixar is back. I hope they have more films of this quality in the future. Not just great movies, but ones that people can connect with.\n\nTL;DR: **It perfectly captures the feeling of being a kid dealing with an unfamiliar or life changing situation.

Now, I am by no means an expert, but it could be easily deducted that the main characters are personifications of the chemicals that control emotions, and how the [spoilers](#s \"controller becoming black and disabled is a metaphor for depression ('she can't feel anymore')\")\n\nThis film, if nothing else, is well thought out. Everything in the imaginary brain world has a purpose, and lines can be drawn to actual brain functions in real life. It makes people think about which emotion is the head of the brain. Some interesting things to note: The mother's head emotion is sadness, while the father's head emotion is anger. Makes me wonder which emotion controls me the most, and why isn't it joy?\n\nThere is plenty of room for further development, and I really think this one should have a sequel (moreso than Cars)", "I'm not getting the extreme praise.

As am avid movie goer, I'm having a lot of mixed feels about this movie. I know, I must be crazy. Everything that I've seen so far has been positive aside from the four 'crazy' people who gave it a negative review on Rotten Tomatoes. I wanted to do that thing where I've just seen a movie and now can't stop thinking about it, so I'm gonna rant to a bunch of internet usernames about how I feel. Feelings are the name of the game anyway, right? The headquarters in my mind must be really firing on all cylinders. \n\nFirst of all, I love Pixar. I love movies in general and am usually pretty optimistic when viewing movies and can definitely recognize what makes a movie stand out. With this movie, I was having a bit of a hard time feeling out how good it really was. The animation was splendid as usual, and the idea is extremely creative and opens up so many possibilities. The cooperation between the different emotions to show how Riley reacts to the different situations in her life was fun and exciting to watch at the beginning, and I loved being introduced to this beautiful, creative look at how the inside of a mind really works.\nThat being said, I don't really know at this point what my exact emotion towards it is, but I know that it's most likely not joy, disgust, sadness, fear or anger. Maybe it's some kind of hybrid of those, but that brings me to something that I was a bit disappointed about with this movie. I felt like Pixar could have gone so much further with this concept. They spent all of their time focusing on the journey Joy and Sadness took and not enough time on Riley or a number of other things they could've dived into. The human mind is so vast! There are so many emotions one can feel and it was strange to me how they limited it to 5 emotions, with only one being happy and the others mainly being negative. I know that the negative emotions are there for a reason, but if we take a step back and look at Monsters Inc., another one of Docter's movies, there is such a vast system of monsters and scarers in that movie that they cover an amazing spectrum of different personalities, ages, shapes, sizes, etc. \n\nThis movie worked best when these emotions were working with each other at Riley's control panel, and I just felt like it lost something when Joy and Sadness went on their separate adventure. You knew that having Anger, Fear and Disgust controlling Riley would lead to negative consequences, so it made every single thing that happened to her 100% predictable during that whole long span. \n\nThe journey to realizing that sadness is important was big, and I give the movie so much credit for how accurate it ends up being with all of this. Don't get me wrong, everything that happened is totally accurate as to what really goes on in a young mind going through these changes, I just felt like from a movie standpoint, the movie spent a lot of time focusing on the weaker points, and not enough time diving deeper into what really worked. \n\nI was hoping Riley would grow up and we would really get to know her better. I wanted the emotions to work together at the end of the movie once they realized what was up with sadness, instead of finally getting back to the headquarters and we have one more minute of them figuring things out, then it's done. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say in this rant is that what the movie did well, it did very well. I just think it got long-winded in the middle portion and could've focused a lot more on what it was really going after, instead of showing us the different parts of the mind. It didn't seem like any of those portions of the mind were that important, because it just very briefly showed them then moved on. \n\n(The imaginary friend was a really nice touch during that middle portion though)\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading this rant. I love Pixar. I love movies. This movie was good, but I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.", "Great film!

There were enough surprises that the plot points I found somewhat predictable didn't really detract from the movie. I also really loved being able to see a functioning park, it's everything I've wanted in a Jurassic Park sequel and more. \n\nIt doesn't quite recapture the magic of the original, but let's face it, the first Jurassic Park delivered something so new that it's likely never to be bested. But this absolutely holds up as a stellar sequel, and I will certainly be seeing it in theatres again.

I wasn't super excited by the end of the movie.  Yeah, the last fight scene was cool but I thought everything leading up to that point (with the exception of a few other scenes) was really lack luster.  Any tension or stressful scene was immediately broken by someone having some witty joke or snarky one-liner, usually delivered by the 10-year-old who nearly got eaten again.  Everybody acted on a \"can't see them, they can't see me\" policy where as soon as the immediate danger is out of sight they just stood.  The characters were really oddly written to the point where I couldn't tell if they wanted me to like them or dislike them.  I felt like the only characters who were handled like they had an actual personality were Owen and Larry, oddly enough.\n\nThings I did like though include Chris Pratt.  His performance and character were both great.  The new dino was pretty cool in that, other than its looks, it was a surprise throughout and a really great villain.  But this movie was book-ended by two great parts.  The beginning where the park was actually functioning was amazing to watch!  Seeing all the attractions and dinos roaming was just as great as in Jurassic Park!  AND THAT ENDING FIGHT SCENE!  Fantastic.\n\nOverall, I think the movie is an okay monster flick, but not much else.  I really wanted to love this movie but I just couldn't do it.\n\nEdit:  Just remembered my favorite scene!  \"Hey, do you want to see something cool?\"  immediately followed by a hard cut to a Mercedes.", "Just got back from a 7 PM showing ... This was SO Much better than the sequels, but not really even the same type of film as the original Jurassic Park. This was an entertaining, fun night at the movies where the audience cheers the good guys, boos the bad guys ... a great overall action film \u2013\u00a0whereas the original JP has that original sheen of awe-inspiring wonder even 2 decades on.\n\nI am a huge fan of the original, and the early trailers of this film were definitely underwhelming. But the actual film was much, much better than I was expecting. That seems to be a trend with recent films \u2013 my trust in trailers is now at an all-time low. \n\nAll in all, a fun night at the movies ... a conscious respect for the original and some pretty badass dinosaurs makes this film a cut above what most people are probably expecting. I have to dock some points for some ridiculous plot points. Pretty much all the bad guys are there to be dinosaur food. The idea to weaponize dinosaurs is absolutely ridiculous. And while I get that after 20 years, people would be \"used\" to dinosaurs at the park, it still doesn't explain how incredibly lax the security measures are. Why in the hell they would have attractions where people could ride around live dinosaurs in canoes or gyrospheres? Even if the dinos are \"veggie-saurases,\" they are giant wild animals. No one could have insured that park. And yeah, I get it, \"IT'S A MOVIE,\" but it's one thing to suspend disbelief that they could genetically create dinosaurs, it's another to just accept the fact that common sense safety measures would be totally ignored.", "They could have easily cheesed up this movie with references to the original but they did it just right. The jeep, the compound, Ian Malcom's book. Just enough call back. And that fight scene. My God it was awesome.", "It is definitely the best sequel to Jurassic Park. I thought it was super entertaining, thrilling, and just a lot of fun. ", "Some points to how silly this movie was:\n\nWe are introduced to these two children and their parents. The kid apparently likes dinosaurs, the other has a girlfriend. This will be about as deep as these characters remain for the entire movie. Apparently the kid's parents are getting divorced (but this is addressed only once for no apparent reason), apparently the older brother is so mean that the mother cries about it (though all the older brother really seems to do through most of the movie is look at girls because funny horny teens are funny (right?), and then as the movie progressing both children are reduced to comedic devices for the occasion and completely-out-of-place one-liner).\n\nSo here is Jurassic world, an amusement park. Great, that's good. And here are the raptors we're training. That's ok too. And here is this geneitcally modified dino. Fine. And Then things go wrong, and the movie goes wrong too.\n\nThe dinosaur sets a trap (doesn't make much sense but sure, we'll say it's a genius dino). The dino evades thermal detection (really doesn't make any sense at all). People go into the dino cage to... look at the claw marks? Whatever, mutant dino escapes. Pratt saves himsefl by disguising his smell. He will never use this tactic again for no apparent reason, yet the audience should be constantly surprised when the sniffing dino returns for a jump-scare.\n\nSuper-dino escapes tears out its tracking device. How? How in god's name does a dinosaur with two stub arms claw a tracking device out of itself? Maybe you put that device out of reach of stub-arms?\n\nNot to worry, they are sending out a containment group.... armed with electric prods and electric guns that do absolutely nothing. Even if this wasn't a mutant dino, this would not work. This is stupid.\n\nThere is some military guy who wants to use raptors as weapons. Lets think about this for a minute. This is the stupidest military tactician in human history. How much does it cost to raise a raptor? feed it? train it? transport it to war zones? maintain it while there? And then, you get the most useless weapon in any environment other than really confined space. Desert warfare? Our raptor weapons are dead from the heat sir! Winter? Our raptors froze to death sir! Tigers are pretty good killers too, but armies don't use tigers because it doesn't make any sense. People have guns.\n\nMoving on. people finally decide to use guns on the escaped dino via helicopter that crashes. For some reason, the aviary contains hundreds, or potentially thousands of carnivorous murderous dino-birds.... apparently contained within a structure that can be broken by a charking rex. Probably not a good idea to build such a shoddy containment structrue for murder birds. Of course, the murder birds immediately begin murdering. Oddly. Like, they are vengeful. The don't fly away, the head to packs of people to killing them.\n\nBut not to worry, our protaganists can have a shoe-horned kiss for no reason while people are being murdered by psycho birds all around them.\n\nOh, the birds are gone, never to be an issue again.\n\nLets go hunt this escaped dino with raptors. Chriss Pratt says no. Military guy says \"we'll do this with or without you\". Pratt says \"I quit\" and, since he's the trainer of the raptors, with the special bond, the military guys can't do anything because the raptors only respond to Pratt. Good move move on pratt's part right? ....oh wait he actually got on a motorcycle to ride through the jungle (somehow) with raptors.\n\nDon't worry, the military jerk will be killed by an oddly vengeful and stealthy (yet quickly clumsy) raptor later on.\n\nOh ya, it turns out the mutant dino has raptor DNA and is now communicating with the other raptors. Remember how we used the mutant dino DNA as an insanely convoluted plot device so many times already (cuttlefish camo, frog thermal invisibility somehow)? ya... here's another one where we use it to explain traitor raptors.\n\nEveryone with a gun will wait to fire upon the mutant dino until it is running away... for no reason.\n\nOh ya, I forgot about the pinball scene. Remember in jurassic park when it was a car that the dino attacked and I thought \"holy shit this is intense\"? Well now it's two kids in a pinball bouncing around like idiots and I think \"this is so unbelievably cheap and stupid\". And then the kids come across the old visitors center from the first movie and I think \"wow, this is going to be sweet\" and instead the kids are mechanics somehow and get an abandoned car working.\n\nBack to the story. The super dino and raptors make it to the visitors centre. But, the raptors are friendly again! Why? no idea! it doesn't make sense. These are just raptors that love to switch sides (almost like they know they are in a movie). And then the mutant dino kills the three remaining raptors. How do we stop this dangerous dinosaur? \"I know\" says the business lady, \"we'll release the t-rex\" (there are still thousands of people nearby but whatever). T-rex mutant battle commences. All appears lost as mutant has won and turns on the protaganists again.\n\nBut hey audience. Hey. Fuck you. That T-Rex was only faking its injury. And a that raptor was faking its injury too. Bet you didn't expect that, right audience? Ya. So the trex and raptor attack the mutant together, pushing it close to the water's edge. And its eaten by a gian gator thing.... PLOT!\n\nAnd now I know what you're thinking. The mutant is dead, but now you have a raptor (with dubious, traitorious intentions) and a t-rex in front of the protaganists. Well fuck you again audience, we'll just have them.... get this.... leave. PLOT PLOT!\n\nAlso, no cell phone or radio will ever work on the island when required.", "Is it just me or are people becoming more and more impressed with Hollywood mediocrity? It seems that just because there was dinosaurs (and one big finale fight scene) that people are willing to look past all the character, dialogue, soundtrack flaws and be satisfied.\n\nI know I will get a lot of hate writing this but surely I can't be the only one that noticed/feels that this movie was a complete let down.  From the weak characters and dialogue writing to all unnecessary cheap comedic one liners just to get easy laughs was astounding.  Even the music was more of a distraction than aiding a scenes ambience whatsoever, it was like they had a soundboard which they could click and queue up clich\u00e9 dramatic, happy and sad music.\n  \nThe two main characters (the brothers) had the presence of a cardboard box and to add more clich\u00e9s, like someone else stated in this thread \"I'm a teenage boy, can't you tell, because I'm always looking at girls. Hey, I'm on screen again, time to look at more girls.\" as for the little brother, its like they were punching our faces with the fact that he was some genius whenever they got the chance.  Even the scene in the back of the truck about how they are brothers and will always be there for one another like good lord.. I was rooting for them to get eaten by the raptors the following scene. They had to add in the evil Ingen plan by having them use the velociraptors as weapons, this story line took up screen time and for what ? just for us to feel somewhat satisfied when Vincent D'Onofrio character gets eaten by the raptor irony.  Even the whole high heel run scene with the T-rex everyone seems to love, to me was another middle finger to the crowd just stating \"hey we can do what we want no matter how plausible or inconsistent because its cool looking\".\n\nOverall I feel this movie sacrificed sophistication to appeal to younger/modern family's crowds and just because there was dinosaurs and the CGI to back it up doesn't hide the fact the movie was a lazy remake which people will go see because of its predecessors. Hold Hollywood to a higher standard.", "Looks like the human's kill count ( on raptors ) is up to two, that RPG blast on that raptor was a sure kill. At least that honor isn't solely held by a teenage gymnast that could a cheap shot on a raptor anymore.\n\nEdit: I forgot about several, but to be completely honest the raptors kills are more important then shooting some birds out of the sky.", "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.\n\nThis movie was god awful. What is wrong with you people?", "Huge Jurassic Park fan, just got back from seeing it. I thought it was mostly good. Really uneven, though.\n\n**THE GOOD**\n\n*Arriving at Isla Nublar*\n\nThis was one of two sequences that got me teary eyed. Finally, a working Jurassic Park. A beautiful island paradise with dinosaurs everywhere. And when the music swells and the classic theme comes in? Waterworks.\n\n*Chris Pratt's Raptor Squad*\n\nPretty much everything involving the raptors was great. I loved the nighttime sequence when they're finally let loose from their paddock and start hunting the Indominus Rex - and when they turn on Pratt and start munching on some InGen grunts.\n\n*Dinosaur Petting Zoo*\n\nA callback to Lex riding the baby triceratops in the original book, seeing all these kids getting to enjoy the dinosaurs was fantastic. In this universe, dinosaurs have been around longer than these kids have been alive - hell, longer than most of the characters have been alive. Just a fun scene.\n\n*The Mosasaur*\n\nPretty much everything involving the Mosasaur was great - it was way too big, obviously, but I can easily head canon it away and say that they intentionally made it large to be more attractive to visitors. Seeing the three-way tag team of the T-Rex, raptors, and Mosasaur take down the Indominus Rex was awesome.\n\n*Old Visitors Center*\n\nThe second time I got teary-eyed. Watching the characters brush the dust off of the old \"WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH\" banner, glance at the raptor painting in the dining hall, play with the night-vision goggles, and repair the old jeep was fantastic. They even had the old walkie-talkies in those slots from the first film.\n\n*Half of the dialogue*\n\nThere were some good moments in the dialogue. I liked the control center guy with the retro Jurassic Park shirt mocking the suits over their corporate-sponsored dinosaurs, and Wu's rant with Masrani over how they've been genetically modifying dinosaurs the whole time was right on the mark. Chris Pratt's rapport with the raptors was similarly effective - I really felt like his character knew the raptors and when they were getting out of line. Kind of reminded me of someone reprimanding their cat or dog.\n\n**THE BAD**\n\n*The other half of the dialogue*\n\nChrist, there are some awful lines in here. Instead of Owen and Claire talking about their history together, why not show an old photo of them in Owen's bungalow or something? And when Claire is on the phone with her sister and saying something to the effect of, \"You're using Mom's lines now,\" like, c'mon, I know you're sisters. You don't need to beat me over the head with establishing your relationship.\n\n*Characters and relationships*\n\nSpeaking of relationships, I didn't buy Owen and Claire getting together at all. They liked each other enough to apparently go on all of one date in the past, and suddenly after a half day together, they're making out in the middle of a pterosaur attack? What? And D'Onofrio's character was one mustache twirl away from being a cartoon character. Masrani was inconsistent - he's, I guess, envisioning himself as the next John Hammond by saying that he cares about his guests having fun and not worrying about the numbers, but then investing all this money into the Indominus Rex and throwing away lives trying to capture it alive. Then, he morphs into Tony Stark and decides to fly a helicopter into action because, for some reason, his instructor was the *only other person on the island who could fly a helicopter.* No, you know, Lifeflight or anything like that. The two brothers seemed to be having a hell of a good time running around the park - I didn't buy them being scared in the slightest.\n\n*The CGI*\n\nMostly bad during the day, better at night. Still not better than Jurassic Park, 22 years later. If you don't want to invest the money into good CGI or animatronics, don't put CGI scenes into your script. Simple as that.\n\n*The fan service*\n\nLook, I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan, but if I wanted to watch Jurassic Park, I'd go watch Jurassic Park. A lot of this movie felt like they picked the scenes from the old movies that they liked and remade them. Characters are moved by a sick or dying herbivore? Check. Parents getting a divorce? Check. Greedy park employee steals embryos from their employer? Check. Raptors surround the protagonists during the climax of the movie at the visitors center? Check. T-Rex saves the day? Check. Dinosaur containment failure causes a recall of park vehicles, but two children end up stuck in the jungle when they're attacked by an antagonistic predator and are only protected by a sheet of glass before escaping down a steep drop? Check.\n\n*Lazy script*\n\nI know that there has to be a certain level of stupidity among the characters for there to be a movie, but my suspension of disbelief was getting strained at times. How often did electronic communication failures cause characters to be unable to relay important information to one another? I counted at least three - the control center being unable to tell Owen et al to get out of the Indominus Rex paddock, Claire being unable to tell the kids to take the gyrosphere back, and Owen's buddy being unable to tell him that InGen was invading the island. How about not using the helicopter at the very beginning to scout out and tranq the Indominus Rex? Why can't Wu tell his boss exactly what they put into the Indominus Rex? Why doesn't Claire change into boots at any point during the film, especially when Owen specifically calls her out on it as soon as they decide to go on their adventure together?\n\n*The Indominus Rex*\n\nGood concept - I like the idea of them making this ferocious creature that's essentially insane because of its total lack of exposure to the world and competing natural instincts. However, the design was just kind of lame looking and I thought the creature's roar was underwhelming. The T-Rex has a commanding presence whenever it's on screen, but the Indominus Rex is just sort of there.\n\n**OVERALL**\n\nJurassic World had a lot of cool moments, but it also had a lot of dumb parts. I wish it were better - obviously - but it could have been a lot worse. Overall, it's no where close to the first one, but it's better than Jurassic Park III and probably (*probably*) better than The Lost World. Go see it and support dinosaurs on the big screen, at least!", "I left the film shaking my head at how dumb this movie was.\n\nIt was just full of of monster/horror cliches that detracted from the enjoyment I was hoping to get from the action and excitement.", "Pros:\n\n- The performances by Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, and their chemistry.\n\n- Giacchino's score in mixing modernity with John Williams' classic themes.\n\n- The Velociraptors training, which was handled better than the trailers depicted.\n\n- The Indominus Rex was great as both an abomination and force of nature that rampaged into each set piece.\n\n- The dinosaurs as a whole.\n\n- The third act.\n\n- The references to the first movie banking on nostalgia of those old enough to remember them.\n\n- It's vastly superior to The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3 in terms of pure entertainment and as a straight-up monster movie, rather than a Jurassic Park movie in the sense that it replaces the awe and wonder with action and Hollywood spectacle.\n\n- Jurassic World's self-awareness crosses into self-parody territory, and that's a good thing. If it took itself seriously without acknowledging its own stupidity with the amount of dumb things that take place in the narrative (particularly the conception of the two Indominus Rexes), that would've been worse.\n\nCons:\n\n- Too many goddamn subplots. When even the minor characters have subplots of their own (which aren't even fully realized), then you know it's congested as fuck.\n\n- The kids. Taking into account how the Jurassic films have always catered towards the younger demographic first and foremost to push merchandizing, and how all the kids in the previous films have basic utility and serve generally as plot devices, it's baffling how Jurassic World takes it further by constantly going back to the kids and their parents' divorce subplot, instead of focusing on the more interesting adult leads and of course, the dinosaurs. I could care less about their bond as brothers when they're barely developed as individual characters beyond exposition.\n\n- The characters are all generic walking tropes and cliches. Owen is a free-spirited manly alpha male. Claire is an uptight businesswoman who has a tenacity for plans and being constantly in control. Hoskins is a generic  \"We gotta weaponize them!\" military man. One brother doesn't want to babysit his younger brother, who is a kid that has ADHD and an Encyclopaedia for a brain. The unorganized tech geek is there solely to be made fun of in moments of levity from all the PG-13 death and carnage.\n\n- The CGI is jarring at times, and this is referring to the quality rather than the overreliance; CGI is here to stay, yes, but there needs to be some form of quality control. The establishing shots of the central area of the park and even the dinosaurs in close-ups can get a little weird. One that comes to mind is when the new guy falls into the pit and Pratt has to save him.\n\nOverall, it's an entertaining popcorn face stuffer on par with Furious 7 and Age of Ultron, but I'm not going to be thinking about it in a couple of days.\n\n3.5/5", "Loooove love loved all the nods- subtle and not, back to Jurassic Park. My parents let me skip school as an 8-year-old to see the original on opening day 22 years ago, and this seemed like a worthy successor!", "Best third act ever.", "I was hooked the whole time. Most of the scenes from the trailers were early on in the movie, which I thought was good. ", "This was just as good as the one I saw in theaters 20 years ago. Chris Pratt kills it and there's genuine suspense and humor throughout. Also really makes me want to drive a Mercedes for some reason....", "Maybe my expectations were too high for this movie, but I walked out of the theater scratching my head. I think what I liked about the other movies is that you could generally attribute the loss of control to some smart person or people being tempted by something bad (hubris, greed, etc.) that results in things blowing up in their face, rather than the stupidity and lack of contingency of unqualified people.\n\nWhile there were plenty of nitpicky things that bothered me throughout the film, I would have been fine if there had been a more reasonable point of failure. For an example, the chaos in the first movie resulted from a culmination of factors: Hammond and Co. playing god, placing profit over safety, corporate spies wanting to steal DNA and the jaded employee succumbing to their temptation and sabotaging park safeguards. Importantly, there is suspense to these elements before the chaos, allowing the audience to anticipate shit hitting the fan for almost half the movie before things really go wrong, leading to a satisfying climax when it finally pops off (it also helped immensely that you were compelled to give a shit about the main characters the first one).\n\n*Jurrassic World* lacks the same complexity and build-up. There is an allusion to greed tacked on by Claire's exposition as she explains why they're making a super-dino. There is the arrogance of Masrani as he resists park evacuation and thinks a non-lethal team can contain the threat. They also kind of throw in war profiteering as Hoskins pushes for weaponization of the raptors. But all of these are not the point of failure.\n\nNo, motherfucker gets out of the cage because of a breakdown in order of operations. Thermal surveillance of the cage comes up negative. OMG, what do we do?! Well we could call in the security professionals prepared for this, because we should have those people, but instead let's put our faith in the lay security opinions of Claire and Masrani. Maybe we should check the CCTV we should have and see if it *actually* escaped? No, we have Claire and Masrani to freak out for us and lead us to conclusions about what happened, thank god. Oh, I know! How about we check the **chip implanted in the dinosaur for the exclusive purpose of tracking its location**. Nah, we should obviously send a small and unprepared group into the cage to investigate this disappearance first. ***What could possibly go wrong?***\n\nMaybe my frustration with this is to do with the fact that technology is less \"magical\" to us compared to how it was in the 90s, when a touch-screen computer with a CD-ROM drive in a Ford Explorer was mind-blowing. The ubiquity of things like GPS technology and digital surveillance makes the idea of losing a 2-story dinosaur with a tracking-chip implant absurd in the present, let alone almost a decade in our future, without some nefarious entity throwing wrenches in gears somewhere. I really wish it had been Hoskins setting things in motion to prove their weapon viability, or Earth First (the group Nick Van Owen was a member of in *The Lost World*) make a return as an eco-terrorist group, sabotaging the park to free the dinos from captivity. Anything but the lazy \"Where'd he go? Dunno, better unlock the door and see what happened...\".\n\nTL;DR: It could have been a good (at least better) movie if the catalyst had been the misguided intentions of Hoskins or Earth First, rather than the incompetence of wooden characters.", "This was the worst movie I have seen with regards to any remake in the last 20 yrs. Including Terminator Salvation, Amazing Spider-Man and many more. \n\nThere was so much bad from a directorial and production standpoint. The actors weren't inherently bad by any means. And even the ridiculous story line could have actually been made into a decent movie.\n\nI blame the director, editing team, CGI, and fuck you Steven Spielberg for becoming George Lucas 2.0 - I know you are only the executive producer that gets the $ for the movie, but you put your name on that piece of shit.

", "**DEUS REX MACHINA**", "My cynical review of Jurassic World:\nNot to burst any nostalgic bubble that seems to be going on here, but was I the only person who came out thinking that it was absolutely terrible. Before you outright attack me let me just underline a few points exactly why.\n-The Plot Was Clich\u00e9d And Predictable \nI knew exactly what was going to happen next and that's not something I want from my summer blockbuster. Also the scene where D'onfrio looks at the carnage and smiles was so awful I cringed. It was the classic clich\u00e9 of bad guy doing something bad to show that he is bad because it isn't clear to the audience about his motivations. \n-Too Many Plot Lines Left Unfinished \nThe main teenager's girlfriend in the film is nowhere to be seen in the climax. Another plot point is when he smiles creepily at some girls and one girl specifically is highlighted. Guess what? That plot line goes absolutely nowhere! To me it felt like there were a lot of scenes left on the cutting room floor. \n-Too much ambiguity \nThe parent's divorce is mentioned once and used solely as a plot device to make us feel some kind of sympathy for characters that we've known for about half an hour, and is never mentioned again. The fate of the assistant is also left ambiguous but I presume that she died in the water.\nThe CGI-\nI don't know if it was just me, but I feel like the over reliance on cgi made the entire film look fake and the dinosaurs not menacing enough. There was no wow factor to the dinosaurs whatsoever, compared to the more practical dinosaurs of 1992. They didn't feel real, so how were we meant to feel sorry for their situation.\nConclusion-\nFinally I would say that Jurassic Park was one of the biggest letdowns of the year so far. It boggles me beyond belief that people can say \"relax it's just a movie\", and not apply that same level of thinking to the transformers movies, which feature the same awful script, predictable action and weak comedic relief, not to mention the god awful product placement. \nI would give it a four out of ten. While it was terrible, you could still have a bit of fun, and it never as bad as it got reached the depths of the lost world.\n", "This might have been the worst movie I've seen this decade. \n\nIt BEATS you over the head with product placement. \n\nThe storyline is terribly predictable and full of holes. \n\nThe cheesy action lines are laughable. \n\nSeriously.

It was just too cheesy for my taste and the dialogue didn't feel real to me. None of the characters are memorable as they were in the original film. I understand the action scenes were fun to watch and the ending with the big fight was awesome, but beside a few key scenes and small throwbacks to Jurassic Park - there was nothing for me to get lost in.

Like Pacific Rim, if you knew what you were getting into, the movie's a blast. Also, I don't know if it was the cinema I went to, or if it was the movie. But wasn't the audio kinda.. *off*? Like, you knew there were big things on the screen, but the usual bass after footsteps couldn't be heard. Usually your seat kinda vibrates a bit (like in Godzilla) but it lacked in here.

The characters in Jurassic World act more or less like those in a standard monster movie. \n\nBeing scientists in Jurassic Park, the characters had a lot more interesting dialogue compared to those in Jurassic World. Two of the characters are kids who contribute nothing other than to get in trouble. Chris Pratt's character is basically a smug everyman lead. Bryce Dallas Howard's scientist was standard. \n\nI felt like the best dialogue came from scenes with B.D. Wong who actually talked about the science (fiction) behind what they were doing. \n\nThe plot itself was a little clunky and had some head scratchy moments. That guy really wanted raptors to be used for military purposes? Just weird. \n\nAnd for all the money they spent, too many dinosaurs just looked too CGI ish. Of course, a lot of them have to be. But I felt like some of them just didn't seem like they occupied any sense of space (which of course they wouldn't, they're not real).....visually, some shots seemed off. Like the great white shark being fed to the kronosaurus. ", "A lot of things in the movie pissed me off/made no sense. Just off the top of my head:\n\n 1. Gyrospheres are completely controlled by the drivers? That could easily lead to people ramming into the dinosaurs/doing other stupid shit. Not to mention theres no way for the control tower to take control of the gyrosphere. Oh look the gyrosphere ride closes immediately after two of the main characters get on? Fuck, isn't that convenient.\n\n 2. The I-Rex is made up to be some super intelligent species, but why? I hardly doubt real dinosaurs were that smart back then, and if you say that scienstists biologically engineered the I-Rex to be smart, you'd think they also have the ability for the I-Rex not to be some super aggressive killing machine. If you're keeping it contained there's no reason for the I-Rex to be made into some alpha predator. You're telling me the same I-Rex who is aware of his tracking device, and can deceive Owen and the workers, doesn't have the cognitive ability to wait for the two kids to emerge from the water after jumping from the waterfall? I thought that was fucking ridiculous.\n\n 3. The kids encounter with the I-Rex is stupid as hell too. You're telling me, right after going off course the kids run into the I-Rex. Remember the helicopter shots? The restricted area is enormous, and the kids conveniently happen to bump into the I-Rex. Those kids should of been LONG killed, right after escaping they were lucky enough to be right next to a waterfall? Fucking seriously? A movie loses a shit ton of suspense when you know the main characters are essentially safe in the midst of all the chaos.\n\n 4. The Velociraptors annoyed me too. I hated how they treated them like a pack of wolves. There's no way of knowing that they were social animals that hunted together but why do so? Simply for the plot device. I find it pretty dumb how initially Owen had trouble controlling them, after that worker got thrown into their area, the velociraptors were about to eat Owen. But right when the velociraptors are called into action and let out, it's like, lol don't worry, they're obedient know. At first they were loyal to Owen, then after, I-Rex gives them a couple of roars and they just turn on him. Normally I guess I would be okay with that, but then just like that, Owen gives them a few pats and all of a sudden they treat Owen as the alpha now? Those velociraptors act just like Lebron\n\n 5. So like 20 years prior you had the tragedy that was Jurassic park, out of containment situation, lots of people died yadda yadda. You'd think after that, they'd take massive measures to ensure that something like could never happen again. But no, they had absolutely no military technology that could take out the I-Rex. Really? I know the I-Rex is a big nasty motherfucker, but I really think a few good RPG shots could easily take it out.\n\n 6. The ending bothered me also. So the T-Rex defeated the I-Rex with a bit of help. I guess the island is saved now right? Nope there's still a fucking T-Rex out and about. But it's not as big or smart as the I-Rex so I guess it's k.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a fun movie, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a good movie.\n\n", "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mztSN4OqY_8 ", "There was a fire alarm in my movie theater that went off right when the T-Rex was about to fight the Indominus Rex WTF", "I'm gonna point out that I'm retarded.\n\nI thought the entire movie that Claire was Jessica Chastain and not Bryce Dallas Howard (who I had only previously seen in Spider Man 3 without realizing it until I looked it up)", "I honestly thought it was pretty bad.

It didn't make since that the demon would want to take the little boys body when he never was a part of the living world, plus he had all he could want in his workshop. He was just hired.

He just has a certain je ne sais quois that *The Conjuring* captures perfectly. I think the premise is beginning to wear thin, but the movie is still a lot of fun to watch. And you know what? I'm still gonna watch the shit out of the inevitable fourth one because *we need to know what the fuck is up with Allison!*", "A lot of the comments I'm reading in this discussion say that the film is bad and it relies too much on jumpscares. I disagree. I thought this film was terrifying and the story was good enough for a horror movie. There are a lot of jumpscares in the movie but none of them are false and they are all really scary, so to me that makes up for how many there are. The two most terrifying scenes are not completely based on jumpscares. The scene where Quinn pulls the blanket off of her and she's on the floor above her, she waits for the elevator, the ghost does not jump up behind her, he just appears, he pushes her to the room, and then the other version of her crawls toward her was freaking horrifying. Also, the scene where she's on the floor and the ghost goes around turning off lights was so scary and it's amazing build up to a jump scare. The scene where the ghost jumps out of the window and then it starts to pull Quinn out of the window was also great. The good camera work made the upcoming jumpscare completely obvious but it was still so scary. The scene where Elise goes into her reading room was nerve racking. The car accident scene was so brutal. When Quinn wakes up in the hospital and she sees the man who can't breathe in front of her was scary and gave a quick look at the ghost since we wouldn't get a good look at it for a while. The scares serviced so many people in this movie while still making sense. Many of James Wan's films have proven that good jumpscares are extremely effective. And yet, the scariest things in this movie to me weren't the jumpscares. \nI thought every single one of the actors gave good performances, especially Lin Shaye and Stefanie Scott. Lin Shaye has been my favorite parts in the first two movies. The scene where she fights Parker Crane is is a little silly but it's so fucking awesome. The other movies have proven that the further is weird with its rules and I thought her karate chop-like move and floor-breaking stomp made sense in that world. The scene with Carl and the scene with her husband were so emotionally stirring. Her character arc in this movie is so good. She was a nervous, sad, frail woman dealing with her husband's suicide and her broken ability. Then she becomes a bad ass ghost fighter and revitalizes her entire life. This is Lin Shaye's best Insidious movie. Stefanie Scott gave a very good, realistic performance. When she realizes Hector isn't the one knocking on the wall, she reacts in such a realistic way. When the ghost touches her shoulder and starts pushing her wheel chair, she was spot on. When she describes her mom, it never felt fake. \nThere are some bad interactions and a lot of jumpscares, but the rest of the movie makes up for those. The cinematography is great. Lin Shaye and Stefanie Scott gave great, realistic performances. Leigh Whannell did an amazing job at writing, directing, and starring in this film. The ghost was so creepy. The sound design is phenomenal. And, this film is truly terrifying. \nThe one cheap jumpscare in this movie is the one at the very end.

It is a movie that is not going to change anyone's perception on the show and the universe it depicts. In fact it doubles down on enforcing those perceptions, be them positive or negative. \n\nIt is not a movie I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen the show or recommend to anyone ever.

So cool.\n\nI found the romance angle between Frank and Athena a little forced and tacked on. I feel like if they had developed it any further, they would've crossed into creepy territory though. Thoughts, anyone?\n\nOverall, I'd say if you were like me and got excited by the trailer, ignore the haters and give it a shot (but I'd go matinee). If not, rent it", "This film was not that bad, I love Brad Bird and he's made some GREAT movies.  Now, this movies isn't great, it's good.  People are bitching that the third act was the worst thing ever made, it wasn't, it just fell a little flat compared to the rest of the movie.  I also see a lot of people hating on Lindelof, I looked him up and I totally get why people don't like him.  I liked Prometheus and WWZ was alright, but I do know a lot of people hate those movies.  If you like to have fun, go see this movie.  it also gives off a positive message that polarizes against these dystopian movies like Hunger Games and Divergent, which I like.  You can tell Brad Bird is a great filmmaker still, but this is just a small fumble.  ", "I just got home from the premiere screening, and unfortunately, this movie isn't very good. This movie can be broken down into two parts: 1) exposition, and 2) the least subtle political commentary I've seen in a long time. \n\nThe film invests so much time in the exposition that it forgot to develop its characters. In the final act of the film we're basically told that what brings on the apocalypse is apathy, and no one rising to the challenge to save the world. It's a pretty good idea on paper, but the film spends so much time with exposition and scenes that have no consequence that when it reveals the threat it's very underwhelming.The characters are pretty much the same people at the end that they were in the beginning, and what difference there is by the end of the  characters' arcs is marginal.  The film came off as one that is a call to action, but with so little development in Casey's character (or all the characters for that matter), the movie doesn't create an engaging avenue of how we should rise to that challenge. It's kind of ironic actually. \n\nThis is where the political commentary comes in. To me, it seemed like the commentary's lack of subtlety was to compensate for the films weak narrative. It's a really bad case of \"tell not show\" (it's not as bad as *Cyberbu//y* in that regard, but that isn't saying much).\n\nWhen I saw *Avengers: Age of Ultron*, I thought Ultron was underused, but *Tomorrowland* set a new bar for underused story elements. In a 2 hour movie called *Tomorrowland* we're barely in Tomorrowland for more than 30 minutes. The majority of that thirty minutes is in the final act, but its not the happy-sunshine-place the trailer tries to sell you on. What you see of Tomorrowland in the trailer is in one scene that's 15 minutes long (maybe), and shortly after George Clooney says it isn't real. He explains to Casey that what, effectively, what we were sold as this movie in the trailer is one big lie. It sucks, because that scene we get to spend in Tomorrowland was a lot of fun. I wish we could have spent more time, in *that* Tomorrowland. \n\nOn the plus side, It was nice to see Hugh Laurie in a movie again, Raffey Cassidy (Athena) gave a pretty great performance, and it was more or less well shot. Unfortunately, *Tommorowland* is by far the most disappointing movie I've seen this year, and it's gettin a 5/10 ", "I can't be the only one who hoped that George Clooney didn't kiss that little girl at the end. There was a kind of creepy vibe going on with that relationship.", "Most disappointing movie I've seen this year.  That last act was a trainwreck.", "Even though the ending had it's problems, I enjoyed this movie overall. And I might be in the minority, but I enjoyed the moral part of it. \n\nOverall gave it a 7.5/10.", "I want to watch it but Damon Lindelof is involved so I am iffy about it", "And Brad Bird bites it. ", "Biggest letdown of 2015. The trailers really missold it.\n\n1) Clooney is only in the first hour for 5 fucking minutes\n\n2) for a film called Tomorrowland so little of the film is set there. And when we get there we don't even see much of. No sense of wonder.\n\n3) Preachy environmental concerns. Cringed at the line about movies/video games\n\n4) The film plays out like it is a critique of objectivism but fucking ends on the same message. I would've much preferred a humanist \"Tomorrowland is for everyone\" ending.\n\n5) Cheesy as fuck. The montage of everyone picking up their pins at the end made me audibly wince ", "Going to be a tough sell because it's 80% exposition, but when that falls away and you see the visuals and the world of Tomorrowland, it's pretty sweet. Definitely could be considered \"Interstellar for kids\" in many ways.", "The movie wasn't as \"preachy\" as I had feared. I took away more the message of hope & optimism, the idea that we *can* change the future for the better, than the quality of the movie itself. The movie itself was pretty good, but I think its ideas are more powerful than the plot. Which is fine - and I think that rather than ragging on a film that may be entertaining for kids (I am curious to hear how younger folks receive it) we should consider the ideas that it raises.\n\n[Ending](#s \"I don't think Nix should have died.\")\n\nThey did solve the safety problems of our jetpacks in the future, so that's nice (airbag suits, basically, that automatically deploy).\n\nI didn't find the Frank / Athena scene creepy, but I also wasn't as emotionally impacted. It did work on someone a few rows ahead of me, though, so it touched the right notes for some people. (It is perhaps worth noting that the only time I've actively cried at any video in many many years was The Flash season finale).\n\nI was also glad we got to see giant robots fighting; I saw one sitting around I think when we first see Frank meet Nix, and immediately hoped it would come into use. I was not disappointed.\n\nThe person I saw it with brought up an interesting point. Nix says that if Tomorrowland let anyone enter, the terrible future of our world (nukes etc.) would happen there. But when we are introduced, we see the spaceport in ruins - hasn't he already begun to let a terrible future happen to Tomorrowland? I'm not sure how to reconcile that - I suggested that the tachyon device, with its sense of finality, created a malaise that seeped not only into our world, but also the world of Tomorrowland.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that I LOVED Nix's jacket.\n\nFurther edit: Forgot to mention that for all the talk about saving our world, they sure do seem to be taking the best and brightest for the benefit of Tomorrowland.

The boy was then found by Fury Road\u2019s chief villain, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), mom\u2019s severed head still in hand. Joe adopted the boy, who continued playing and grew up to be Joe\u2019s troop-rallying rocker.\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing we never get too much of a close-up on the character in Fury Road: iOTA says the mask he\u2019s wearing in the film, according to his and Miller\u2019s backstory, is the face of his late mother, which he sliced from her skull. Told you it was dark.\n\nThough iOTA isn\u2019t sure where the \u201cComa\u201d part of his character\u2019s name came from, he can explain the genesis of \u201cDoof.\u201d It\u2019s a play on what Australians refer to as \u201cdoof parties\u201d \u2014 electronic music events where house or techno beats go \u201cdoof doof doof.\u201d Thus, the Doof Warrior.\n\n\nFor the audition:\nHe went in costume as a Mad Max 2 character, wearing tethers and leather, black eye makeup, and dirt applied to his teeth. \u201cI just wanted it so bad, so I was going to go all the way,\u201d iOTA recounts. \u201cI got in the cab and the guy gave me a funny look.\u201d But it was worth it.

", "The film's treatment of women is easily one of its strongest aspects.\n\nToo many times I see movies where there's this overcompensation to make the strongfemale^TM appear unrealistically badass to the point where it just becomes patronizing. \n\nThe women in this movie are incredibly badass and I believed every second of it. Max is physically imposing but as a pure fighter he doesn't hold a candle to Furiosa. He's bigger and maybe has her outmanned in hand to hand combat, but it's a realistic result of their size differential. She's tougher, meaner, handier, and a much much better shot. But they also don't go the bumbling idiot and clear-minded woman who keeps him on the right path route. They help one another. The women aren't damsels in distress/escort missions and they're not untouchable. They're real people in a bad situation. \n\nI kept waiting for the scene where Max is fighting some bad guys and is put in a bad spot only for one of the mothers to hit someone over the head with a lamp. It never comes. They fight to the best of their ability and sometimes it's enough and sometimes it isn't. They're  also complicated. They dress the same way (and look pretty similar) are grouped together, and yet it was incredibly easy to distinguish them as characters. That's astonishingly difficult to pull off in a movie that moves at a lightning speed. \n\nSome of the women were strong and some of them weren't really. Just like real people. The rest of the movie is immaculate but I was particularly impressed by this aspect. I'd have trouble pointing to a movie in the action genre that did it better.\n\nEDIT: Might be reading a bit too far into it but Furiosa's long range ability (sniping) compared to Max's short range preferences (shotgun, fists) tells us a lot about their characters. Furiosa always has a long term goal in mind, an oasis at the end of the road. Max just wants to escape. His obstacles are short term.

Tom Hardy embodied the ethos of the Mad Max character but I'll have to re-watch the movie to better appreciate his performance. It was kind of jarring not seeing Mel Gibson in the role. Overall, it was a really fun experience in the theater \u2013 I would suggest catching it there and not waiting to watch it on your TV/ monitor.", "Even without watching the first three films I was totally into the movie.

Never have I been so engrossed in a movie.  I was literally on the \"edge of my seat\" and grasping at everything that was thrown at me.  The sound of every car being crushed apart by explosives and the shouts and screams of every man was captured beautifully.  I had goosebumps the entire time, and the execution of it all was top notch.

It's the absolute best paper-to-big screen movie I've ever seen. George Miller said , \"I want this\", and we probably got exactly that.  Highly detailed, highly characterized, glorious cinematography. It's a new standard for so, so many things: How women should be portrayed, how minor characters should be portrayed, how practical effects should be married to CGI and not separated, how 3D can be a movie standard without being intrusive, how you don't have to coddle audiences with drawn out sequences of exposition, how creative liberties can create a masterpiece if in the right, unshackled hands, how MOVIES SHOULD BE FUCKING DIRECTED....Fuck, I could go on, but nobody is reading this.

I have seen the movie once, as I'm sure 99% of the people commenting have. It is amazing, it is fun, it is unique, it is crazy, it is a spectacle and one of the most badass action movies I have seen. I don't know if repeat viewings will leave me feeling the same way, but for that one viewing it lived up to the hype. \n\nI can't even imagine being someone reading through this thread not having seen it yet. I would be in utter disbelief. Aside from the people saying this is the greatest action film ever made and that people no longer need to make action movies because George Miller just won the genre, people are mostly correct. It *is* the Summer blockbuster you have wanted every time you have seen a trailer for the new biggest whatever. It's like all the crazy chase scene ideas you create in your imagination have been actually made, plus babes, guns, loud engines, cool bad guys and flaming electric guitars. George Miller is a kid with $100 million Hot Wheels. ", "Hoolllly fuck. The closest thing I can compare the last 2 hours to may be watching Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time in the theater when I was 12 years old.\n\nEDIT: Now that I'm not in the theater parking lot and back home ... a few more thoughts.\n\nI have never seen any of the other Mad Max films and didn't really have an interest in seeing them. When I started seeing the reviews come out I found it hard to believe this movie could live up to the hype, but man did it deliver. It was possibly the most ridiculous, insane (in a good way) movie I've ever seen. This is one of those movies where the audience experience really amps up the enjoyment of the film too. After every massive action scene you could hear the audience catching their breath. Yes, my audience did applaud at the ending which normally irritates the hell out of me, but this was okay. It was more like a collective release after two hours of sheer adrenaline. The attention to detail is unbelievable. Just watching the set piece of the Citadel was breathtaking \u2013\u00a0and then the cinematography out in the desert, in the mucky swamp (with the Dark Crystal-style weirdos on stilts), the open night sky, the sandstorm ... just an amazing film to take in. I was skeptical but truly this film took me back to being a kid again, when Spielberg and Lucas were still making films like Raiders and Terry Gilliam was making Time Bandits. They just don't make action movies like this anymore, and it's a shame because Miller is 70 years old. \nMy only criticism would be how quickly Max and Furioso bonded ... it seemed like they got pretty close pretty quickly. But man, go see this movie and then go see it again. It's like getting off a roller coaster and going to the back of the line to do it all over again.", "colors. pay attention to the colors. how the mood was expressed in such obvious color choices. the main color pallet for the chases are red and yellow like fire and rage. the part where they are stuck in the mud and getting desperate is blue. totally blue everywhere like it was shot through a blue filter. looking off into the east where they think there is hope it is white. white like the war boys who could bring death, or hope for a future. the goal being to eventually find a place where it is green. ", "For such a simple story that was more kinetic opera than plot, it did have some very interesting and consistent themes. There's a lot of obvious mothers and motherhood themes (the pregnant breeders, the systematic processing of human milk, the tribe of old women, Furiosa herself as a guiding matriarch) that are mostly correlated with being imprisoned or chained or processed in some way--perhaps echoing a mistreatment of *mother-earth* for greed and violence ecological sort of theme that is usually present in some form in most dystopian, post-apocalyptic settings. \n\nThere's also a kind of expulsion from Eden, or Matrix-esque allegory of the Cave kind of theme going on also, most notably seen in Nux and the rest of the fanatical \"lost war boys,\" who are promised a paradise in death. Nux has his umbilical cord severed--from Max--as the painful reality of his awakening to the the truth shatters his previous skewed perspective. The Fury Road is thus equated with a painful journey or process of growth after an expulsion from a green, lost paradise (Furiousa's lost childhood home) and the shattered perspective and realization that the only *paradise* they will find is the one they create: the place they improve and elevate that's already around them, for they ultimately return exactly were they began (the lush, green potential of the Citadel)--this time, however, freed from the false chains that previously imprisoned them as \"lost war boys\" hell bent on an all but inevitable path of self-destruction. \n\nThe movie ends with Furiosa rising with the rest of the remaining \"mothers\" to inevitable give *birth* to the promise of a better future. Max and Furiosa were linked and healed together (for the movie was really their co-journey or co-story) as they both seemed to repair--in some crucial way--something broken inside of them through their arduous and shattering journey through the Fury Road: which can also be seen as the symbolic process of birth and transformation, or the rebirth of your new self; the regained innocence or home that was once lost. After passing through the birth canal, one arrives, thrust into the world, screaming and covered in blood, and I think that greatly resembles the *feel* of the extended, maniacal and terrifying chase sequences throughout the movie. Ultimately though, it seems to be the promise of a better future that is thematically at its core, even in a broken or dying world, and is something that was made possible because of that simple premise--in a narrative sense at least--that a broken world is only truly fixed by repairing something broken inside of you, and vice versa.", "Nux was by far one of my favorite characters I've ever seen in a movie. His character arc was well done in my opinion. Even when he was \"bad\" I felt for him, so when he finally decided to help Max and Furiosa it was like a relief. And his sacrifice at then end was sad for me, I had really hoped he would have won.\n\nAlso, bro picked up the redhead hottie. Props.\n\n\nClose 2nd was ~~Guitar Guy~~ Coma-Doof Warrior. Like seriously, the dude just played guitar for hours on end. Talent.", "I feel like i'm insane, this has a 99% of rotten tomatoes, I see nothing but rave viewer reviews everywhere. I'm a huge fan of the first three mad max movies (especially the first 2). I just got back from the theater and I feel like this was a huge disappointment. The visuals and design on everything was impeccable, but it just felt like the first hour and a half was really repetitive and dare I say holding back? I kept questioning whether this movie was R rated till that last battle, every kill was a pg-13 style cut away till then. The small emotional bits didn't hold any weight for me cause they were built upon nothing. Once that final battle happened though I was like \"This is what I was waiting for\", its the only truly Great part of the movie and it was bloody fantastic. Its worth seeing for that final battle alone. It finally got down to some dynamic action shots, and finally showed some blood and gore, and it was glorious. Maybe I hyped it up to much, which isn't hard to do with a 99% on rotten, but overall a disappointment.", "**The Tree**\n\nIt's the last tree in the area (possibly on the continent), and Max & Nux tear it down in the process of solving their immediate problem, and with no consideration of the longer-term cost of their actions.\n\nIt's the same process of how their world got to where it is - ecological disaster, war, calamity.\n\nLater, it's revealed that it was the last of the green place, and Furiosa 's tragedy.\n", "I almost feel deflated now that Episode 7 has no fucking chance of topping that.", "If at any point during a drinking game, I were to hear \"Never have I ever consensually experienced a cataclysmic assault on every single one of my senses.\" I would not only have to take a shot, but also finish the bottle it came from, and then drink the actual brewery it was manufactured in.\n\nThis movie was abso-fucking-lutely insane.

Miller did SUCH and excellent job of showing and not telling.   If Nolan, for instance, made this movie there would have been line after line of exposition explaining every facet.  Instead the audience is allowed to just absorb the world, from the milk maids to the cancers, the various tribes and \"towns,\" their psycho religion, the hierarchy.   The creativity is incredible and I'd bet money that hardly a day has gone by that Miller hasn't put something on paper for the Max-Verse.   The man loves his work and it shows in spades.

Couldn't understand half the shit the guys were saying.  Gonna get down voted to oblivion but hope I can find someone who agrees that this was a good movie, nothing special.

Not because it's 3d but because I want to see it again anyway and think it might as well be 3d.\n\nOne thing I'd like to bring to the discussion is an interesting argument. This movie had **no** Romantic subplots. Anything that was close to \"romantic\" was just empathy. This is a crapshit world where a majority of people *never* receive human kindness. The promise and attraction boning wasn't what turned Nux. It was his world falling apart and being treated kindly (motherly?). Max wasn't in love he just didn't want to add another nightmare to his dreams. Characters cared about each other without it being *romance*.\n\nAnother quandry I'd like to throw out there is this : Were the badass old ladies on motorcycles meant to be a kind of Valkyrie? Valhalla was mentioned quite a bit.\n\nPS: The old women where great. Terrifying even.

The dialog had no substance and was mostly sprinkled in so that semblance of narrative could be seen in the 2hrs of explosions.

I know that insanity is the realm of the Max Max genre, but this movie was lost on me. \n\nThat being said, the cinematography was gorgeous and the action sequences were almost flawless, but I need more to actually connect with a film.

The original has always had a special place in my heart, and the other two films are great actions yarns as well. Both the original and *Road Warrior* set the bars high for future action films to aspire to, while revolutionizing the genre with its' non-stop action thrills. \n\nMy brother has since passed on nowadays, and I went to see the film on my own, today. \n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years since I first saw the original with him, and it has also been nearly 30 years since *Thunderdome* premiered, and let me tell you, this film was worth the wait and time. In a way, *Fury Road* might just be the film that George Miller has always envisioned *Max* to be, with the help of modern technologies, a big budget and some old school film making effects (such as the erratic frame rate, for example), to create a fuel injected, roller coaster ride. \n\nAnd like Mel Gibson to Tom Hardy, it is also acting as a passing of the torch for both the series and for my late older brother and myself. \n\n*Fury Road* is here folks, and it is awesome to hold that torch high.

To me Max was the random guy existing as a loner trying to survive who occasionaly gets thrown into circumstances that eventually force him to get involved. He has to assess each circumstance and see how far he personally needs to get involved emotionally to just be able to go on his way. He is the classic loner and therefore never the most interesting guy.", "Just got back from it, it was entertaining but I didn't think it was a very good movie.

Bella still looks kind of displeased. I kind of wish we got to see her and the other Bella's relationships develop more. They're living together. They spend a lot of time together, but honestly they don't seem much closer and Becca still kind of looks like she's unhappy to be there. They obviously are supposed to be super close and sisters, but I wish there were more scenes that really portrayed that bond and friendship. \n\nHer and Jesse's relationship hasn't really grown past what they were. But I thought it was great that they dealt with what was happening AFTER they finished college, after they were done with the Bellas. That was an interesting struggle. And it left things open for Emily to continue. \n\nI thought the new characters were entertaining enough. The jokes from the Guatemalan girl were hilarious but every single thing she said was related to her background. I think the Benji and Emily storyline was cute, and the throwback to former Bellas was awesome. Adam Devine is hilarious and fun.

Lol ok.", "I have alot to say about this movie.\n\n1.  Not enough treblemakers. While the first films story revolved around the whole girls vs guys theme, compared to this girls vs the world theme, Im a little sad they werent in it more. They essentially had 2 scenes in the whole film. There were plenty of opportunities to fill them in as well! The party in the beginning, the first performance coulda been longer, the date scene, hell even a battle at the camp they went to. Anyhoo, just a tad disappointed.\n\n2. The Jokes - While felt overall the film was hilarious, there was one element that bothered me. That guatemalen chick. Sh wasnt in the first one, and her only purpose was to say random one liners, most of which was pretty cringe worthy or REALLY over the top. Honestly kinda took me out of the element of the movie. Not a single laugh was heard in my theater past her first joke. Woulda been better with out her.\n\n3. The original* songs - I dont have a big problem with these. The end song was not bad, although I can see how some consider it a bit forced(IT WAS).\n\n4. Songs - I felt that the first had more songs/wider range of song genres than this one. While the performances were nice, you could argue that there was just alot of the \"same\" sounding stuff.\n\n5. Amount of \"Musical\" scenes - I didnt feel like there were the same amounts of singing scenes as the first one. The first one had a lot more \"random\" singing scenes than this one. That gave the first one a more \"musical\" vibe, while this one you get the \"im watching a performance\" vibe. Definitely not the same. Im a hardcore musical fan, and I think the lack of randomness hurt what made the first so good. \n\n\nAll in all, Im glad to have seen it, and it did help me get my pitch perfect fix. Although, I will say I think the first is better. Not disappointed, but I think my expectations were a little too high. ", "Saw it about a week and a half ago. I enjoyed it, but I am bummed I didn't like it even more. \n\n1) I thought a lot of the side characters got less screen time. The other Bellas, Skyler/Benji. All of their time was given more to Bumper and the two newer girls. \n\n2) Too much Flashlight. It felt awkwardly forced.\n\nBut other than that, loved most of the music. Das Sound Machine was awesome.", "I'm pretty disappointed with this movie. I really liked the first movie, but the movie is basically a rehash of the first. Same beats, same narrative flow, same ending. More Fat Amy. This is comparable to Hangover 2, where they take the funny minor character and basically put them as the forefront of the jokes. \n\nThe movie is all over the place - even though most of the cast return, it's not really made clear who the main character is until 25 minutes into the movie. There's new blood introduced that we spend a lot of time with, but flick back and forth between her and Beka from the first movie. I legitimately thought the new girl was the star for a while. The narrative throughline is established early on, but then we just faff around for an hour until the end of the movie.\n\nThe main conflict is Beka getting distracted from the Bellas, and hiding her internship from her friends. But then the issue is solved in minutes. It's very by the numbers - which is fine, if there is something else to bring to the table. I didn't find the movie very funny - I found it forced, and I don't remember the first movie relying on racist humour. Everytime the movie tried to go sentimental it was cringeworthy and undeserved.\n\nPositives, musical numbers were good. Rebel Wilson was over relied on for laughs, but she was probably the best actress.\n\nTL;DR you'll get more entertainment and more girl power for Mad Max ", "I think one of my favourite random jokes from this movie was the one about the ladder reinforcing a hierarchy and \"That's not what we're trying to do here!\" or something along the lines. ", "Much weaker movie than PP1, I'm not sure why the story went the way it did. I wish they tied the old acapella groups together or something, Skylar Austin's character wasn't used at all and he was really one of the focal characters in PP1. When Anna Camp is on the screen though... she's great. Radiates Aubrey Posen and doesn't miss a beat.\n\nDSM is really good though, they pulled it off ahha. I really didn't feel too much about the first 2/3's of the movie, but after the camp scene, it really comes together to find some charm. Not as much as PP1, but enough to carry me to the end. That last song was great, nice way to end it off.\n\nI think I would give this a rental rating. Not worth it in theaters though, unfortunately. I really want to like this movie too =(.", "I liked it! I really felt like ending my night with some laughs and it delivered. It did feel more forced than the first one and though there is rivalry, it\u2019s anticlimactic because you know they\u2019re graduating and therefore winning. The plot was kinda whatever but there are a ton more jokes and more singing. \n\nThe riff-off was especially great and Hailee Steinfeld is super cute; however, I find her character pointless. I also don\u2019t understand how the acapella group will continue on with her being the only Bella left behind? \n\nTo put it short, I think it\u2019s worth watching if you want easy entertainment and something light-hearted.

Probably not as much as the first one - some of the novelty did wear off, but this movie had a direct line to my funny bone. Every joke was perfectly in line with my sense of humor. I was the only one in the theater laughing at the Hayden Christian Anderson/Star Wars joke, but it felt like this movie was written specifically for me.\n\nCan not recommend enough, especially if you liked the first one.\n\nAlso, being from Wisconsin, the crowd went absolutely nuts when the Packers showed up. Hilarious.", "Does anyone know the name of the song, they play during there map overview scene to Copenhagen? My gf cant find it on the interwebs.", "I feel like this movie had funnier moments, but the first one was a better overall movie. There were parts of this that just felt a little out of place because we didn't see the progression of how they got there since this movie took place three years after the first, like Beca and Jesse's relationship (which I feel like was hardly mentioned) and some of the newer Bellas (the Guatemalan girl). Also I didn't like how they spent so much time on Emily, even though I could tell she's going to be the main character for the next movie they they are (probably) going to make.\n\nIt felt a little all over the place, like they couldn't decide on one main plot. Was it Beca's internship and her struggles with doing that and being in the Bellas, or was it the World Championship? They didn't do a good job of connecting the subplots together in my opinion.\n\nI liked the songs in the first one better, too. The original song they added took a lot of excitement out of my theater because no one knew it and could get into it. I feel like with time it can be a hit, but it didn't work in the movie.\n\nThe riff-off was great in this movie. Loved the Green Bay Packers. Das Sound Machine was also amazing.

Also the Riff Off at that guy's house was so random, it felt like a film interlude or something.  It was a fun film, but it was a rehash of the first one and the cast's comedic timing is what makes it so enjoyable.", "I thought it was much better than the first Pitch Perfect.\n\nPrimarily because it didn't center around Anna Kendrick being emo and too cool for school. And didn't have the predictable love story as the main plot.\n\nIt's like they stripped away the main faults of the first movie and made a much more palatable one.\n\nThe last Bella performance was ho-hum compared to the first movie's though.\n\nI liked the Indian group called \"Naan Stops\".", "I thought this one was a litter weaker than the first, and hit a lot of the same notes, but was still enjoyable.

The new characters were underutilized. The \"bad guys\" didn't seem as impressive as the first one, and even though the final battle played out on a global scale (instead of just in NY), it somehow seemed to have less impact than the first movie.\n\nActually, the more I think about it, those might be the same movies. They both had the whole \"team loses it's identity\" thing, and they both fixed it by \"roughing it\" in the wilderness for a while. They also had the issue of \"some people want to move on from the team (Stark/Beka) while others can't (Chloe/Cap)\" plotline. They both gave a more prominent romance story to the big one (Hulk/Fat Amy).

It got to a point where it was like \"okay, WE GET IT, he's sexist and racist\" it got a little grating by the end, to the point where my theatre actually cringed in anticipation of one of his last lines\n\n- I felt the same way with some of Flo's lines, although her jokes seemed to start being funny again towards the end\n\nI enjoyed the songs, I've been listening to the Jessie J cover of Flashlight on repeat for the past couple of days.

This movie is 15 white and pretty (for the most part) girls and one lesbian black girl and one latino. I feel like they were only there for the sake of saying they had a black girl in it.\n\nAnyway, besides those points I though the movie was shitty. The main problem is practically non-existent. The Bellas couldn't perform at a collegiate level but they could still compete at an international level so that isn't really an issue. And Becca is doing an internship for a genius music producer but doesn't tell her band mates. It is one of those films where everything could be sorted out in the first 5 minutes.

Predictability isn't a bad thing, but when the pacing is really slow and the characters are bland then it becomes tedious. I also felt the world and the virus weren't defined or explained very well. \n\nOn the flip side, this is quite possibly the best acting Arnold has ever done. Understated and restrained, he is the best part of the film. While I feel the movie is a misstep, I hope the movie is successful enough for Arnold to tackle more roles like this. I also dug the bleak look of the film. A lot of work went into creating an emotional story and aesthetic, it's just a shame a lot of it didn't click. ", "Just finished watching Maggie. The film is basically about the final few days of Maggie's life with her dad before she is going to turn into a zombie. I really like this take on the \"infection\", it takes like weeks for them to turn and civilization isn't just over because there is a zombie outbreak. Like it actually looks like things might be alright. \n\nAnd man... Is the movie depressing! The first few minutes it got me all emotional already, just Schwarzenegger's face caries so much weight and emotion, you can't just not feel for the guy. You can see how he is making a brave face in front of his daughter, but when he is alone the man breaks down in tears. And while it's sad and depressing, it's also very beautiful how they spent their last few moments. It shows a great father-daughter relationship. Both Breslin and Schwarzenegger bring their A game. Sure Schwarzenegger still sounds like Schwarzenegger, but he really brings a lot of emotion to his performance.\n\nThe film is a bit slow, especially after the first few minutes. But once they went deeper into their relationship and the other people affected by this situation it hooked me and never let me go. It's beautifully shot and the soundtrack is gonna really make you tear up.

Maggie is a really uninteresting character and I didn't buy the relationship between Arnold and Maggie at all, which was mainly the scripts fault.\n\nEverybody really tries which automatically makes it the best of Schwarzenegger's comeback movies. They really tried and wanted to make this movie. A lot of effort went into Maggie, it's not like Sabotage or Expendables 7. It seems nobody is capable of doing movies like Commando anymore so Arnie is forced to take some risks and for the most part it worked for him. He's great in Maggie.

", "Starting out with the positives, Arnold Schwarzenegger is still a really imposing and galvanizing screen presence. This is the type of film I wish he'd do more of because the way Henry Hobson frames him on screen, and the way some scenes carry themselves without dialogue, is a perfect representation of why Schwarzenegger is actually a good actor. In Total Recall it was the kind of vaudeville facial expressions that sold the comic every man caught in a tight situation, here it's more Buster Keaton; woeful, sad, deliberate. The problem is the fact that Schwarzenegger is doing good acting in a bad film.\n\nHenry Hobson is a first time director and it shows, the scenes where people are required to speak dialogue are handled terribly. For instance, after Wade speaks to the sheriff for the first time he does the shpeel about \"You and I go way back...\" and it was delivered in such away that I rolled my eyes, but then it continues in the next scene with Joley Richardson and Schwarzenegger sitting down discussing what Wade had done in killing the two zombie children. Had Hobson been a better director this would have all been sold on just Schwarzenegger face. He would have thrown the script away and told the actors to sell everything through their face eyes and hands. Schwarzenegger has the kind of lived in sunken in expression to sell grief and I hope this doesn't make him shy away from these types of roles because if anything it's this kind of role he can do now and totally nail, accent withstanding.\n\nThe zombie premise was interesting if mishandled. The cinematography was drab, but occasionally you can see moments of beauty. I'm reminded of the shots of Wade getting out of the truck and hugging his kid against the backdrop of rural America and the scenes in which Wade burns his crops that were incredibly well shot. Part of me wishes there was no dialogue in this film and that Hobson realized that his limits as a director directing actors might be handicap by the fact that he probably can't afford too many takes. Even so, this should have been Terrence Malick's Badlands meets Day of the Dead and instead it comes off as a little amateurish direct to DVD film. \n\nI would like to see Schwarzenegger tackle more roles like this leading into stuff like \"Things We Lost in the Fire\" or \"Babel.\" He's at that point in his career where he can straddle the lines between comedy and drama that he'd be able to pull it off. Could he get an Oscar? Possibly. He needs to start working with the directors that Tom Cruise was working with in the 80's and moving back and forth between indie and prestige films.

Wasn't horrible or anything but nothing in it really grabbed me, it just seemed like there were never any stakes or any real tension. Stuff just kinda happened for 2 and a half hours, the end. \n\nEdit: I was kind of vague in my initial review because I had just seen it and was still processing it. I think my main issue was that there weren't any moments where I was like \"Oh shit! What are they going to do now?!\" and there weren't any moments that just really blew me away. There were cool sequences, but none of them had enough drama to make them anything more than a kind of chuckle to myself \"that was cool\" moment. For example, the Dark Knight Rises is a mess of a movie, no doubt. But the first time I saw it there were still stand out moments where I was like \"Oh SHIT, I was NOT expecting that!?\" or just \"Woah, I can't believe this is happening!\" For this movie it puttered along well enough, but there just wasn't a single thing I would call great in it. \n\nJust look at this thread. The main things people are talking about are Vision picking up the hammer, Hawkeye getting \"character development\", and Quicksilver's death. Are any of those really amazing moments?! In a 2 and a half hour movie, the things people were most excited for lasted a mere couple of minutes in total, and IMO were all handled as weakly as possible. Hawkeye had some clever lines, but the movie didn't make me care about him. Quicksilver barely seemed like a character and more of a caricature, DOFP did him (and just about everything else) a million times better. I did get a kick out of the Vision Mjornir bit, but that's like a one-off joke for the fans that lasts seconds.\nUltron was okay. James Spader was perfect...but he basically took one guys arm off...that's literally it. You don't see a single person die...or even seem to be in any real peril. An army of robots is swarming over this place and no one seems to be harmed at all. And QS death comes so late that Ultron is already basically defeated. If they were going to do that, put it earlier when Ultron seems like having a chance of success...then it has some power behind it and makes Ultron more menacing. \n\nTo not just be a negative nancy, there were good parts. I loved some of the action team-up between superhero sequences. That was pure comic book fun. Iron Man vs Hulkbuster was fun, and funnily enough it seemed like more people were in danger during that than when Ultron unleashes his attack. Scarlet Witch's powers were done well, but her acting kinda went in and out of being good. I liked War Machine a LOT in this film, he seemed to be one of the few people truly having fun. \n\nLike I said, didn't hate it. But on a first watch it felt like it should've had more \"OH MY GOD!\" moments, and it was mostly just kinda a muted \"That's kinda cool.\" instead. I can think of some truly mediocre/bad movies that grabbed me more on a first watch. They subsequently fell apart with further watches, but they at least had a few tricks up their sleeve. That first watch I'm usually a sucker for, I let myself just go with the flow, and don't try to over-analyze the film...this just felt weak unfortunately, so how's it gonna feel if I watch it another couple of times? It's possible it will grow on me, but I'm skeptical.\n\n", "Alright, long post incoming. Cue Ace Ventura inhale:\n\nThis was the most boring movie I've ever been entertained by. It was good. I liked it. It was a good movie. But *something* was off. I'm going to keep typing until I figure out what.\n\nIt started out really well. The opening sequence at Strucker's complex was fantastic, and I loved that he *opened* on a one-shot of every Avenger doing their thing. Basically saying, \"you guys know what's up, we've done this before, let's just do this\", which was welcome, but the fact that it didn't heighten that much throughout the rest of the movie is part of why I wasn't as impressed.\n\nHawkeye was great. People are going on and on about how great it was that he got a background and a character, and honestly, I don't give a shit about that, I give a shit about him being funny and having a purpose in the film. His family life was a typical \"dangerous job, frightened, but understanding wife\" trope. I really don't understand why everyone's going on about how he's now a complete character when all they did was making him a boring trope. What *I* liked about the character is he wasn't just there. He was there with a purpose. He was funny. He convinced Scarlet Witch to get back in it. He did well. But I wish his family life weren't so... and it's weird to say this as ridiculous of a superhero movie as it is... typical.\n\nScarlet Witch was *really really really great*. I loved her character. I loved her movements, it was very alien, very \"witch\"-like. And she was badass, which is what you want out of an action movie character. Really excited to see more of her, and she was miles ahead of other characters in the film.\n\nBlack Widow was a huge disappointment. I was pumped that more women were gonna be in the movie, but it seems like as one new woman rises another must become a stereotype. Whedon, you're calling Jurassic World sexist and then you thrust Black Widow out of the role of sarcastic spy agent who has a purpose and right into love interest who can't have kids (which TOTALLY MATTERS FOR A WOMAN, her life is RUINED because she can't be a MOM :( booo boooo this throwaway plot point) and is hurt and sent off twice and is fucking kidnapped and is more of a whimpering, emotional character than what she was set up as. I don't know if this was meant to be going into her character and giving her more, but it felt like giving her less by thrusting her into the classic action hero female tropes. It was disappointing.\n\nUltron. Ultron was all over the fucking place. One second he's a badass AI bent on world destruction, the next he's a whiny teenager. I get it. That's what he was. But it didn't work. It was scattershot, it was a HUGELY rushed character, and it was boring. Spader did a good job with the voice acting, but the character was too jumpy: going from quippy Stark clone to mega super villain to childish teen to silly murderer... blech. Such a waste. Thought Marvel finally had a good villain in their hands and then... nope.\n\nDid I miss Julie Delphy? I was half-expecting her to show up as Madame Web or Captain Marvel. Did I just miss her?\n\n**EDIT**: So Julie Delpy played the woman from Black Widow's flashbacks... Seems like a really small role. Kinda bummed, she's a great actress and that was a bit of a throwaway character. But I guess you could say the same about Andy Serkis.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Okay, so I didn't know about Serkis' comic book character and apparently he'll be prevalent in Black Panther. Cool. Still doesn't explain why Delphy got a throwaway character.\n\nMid-credits scene was bullshit. Nothing we don't know already. Didn't tease anything we didn't already know. Yawn. Show me Spidey, show me... anything interesting.\n\nI think that's what the issue was. Is that this movie was nothing more than an introduction to a few new characters. Nothing matters at the end. Hulk flying off isn't an \"oh no!\" because we all know he's coming back in the next one. Stark saying he's quitting is such bullshit because he's done it twice now and nobody believes him... the end of IM3 was meaningless now. This movie could've not existed. I feel like it was just filler. This movie suffered from being nothing more than a tease for things to come with a few average-but-not-great action sequences thrown in (except Hulkbuster... god damn that was fun). But the ending sequence was just all over the place. Hulk disappeared until he was needed. Fury was nothing but a Deus Ex Machina. It was teased as a movie primed to be darker and more serious, but it was just Whedon quippy dialogue that felt super out of place at times. A movie that's 2 and a half hours long shouldn't feel rushed. And that's what this movie was. Rushed. Packing too many characters in. Packing too much while feeling in the end like so little. \n\nIt's still an entertaining movie. It's still fun. But it once again is showing me that Marvel is so goddamn formulaic. Even killing off Quicksilver fell flat because who gives a shit about a character who got literally zero development? I welcomed killing off Hawkeye, making his horror a reality and then they didn't. Also, Stark was a fucking piece of shit and no one called him on it. No one. Everyone was just too busy moving along to the next plot point that they didn't have time to fucking breathe, both in the script and in the characters' actions and emotions.\n\nI don't know guys. I feel like the 75% on RT is well-deserved. Because this was really nothing special. A fun movie that strived to be much bigger than it was that's nothing more than servicing the grander picture. Which is really shouldn't. It should serve the bigger picture WHILE being its own entity. Nothing surprised me in this film. And I feel like nothing's going to surprise me in the future because it's all the same.\n\n6.5/10 - Boring-taining. If that makes any sense at all. Empty fun that has no shame in striving to be better and being totally fine making billions failing.\n\n**EDIT 3**: Some people are wondering why I didn't touch on Vision. I didn't get much out of him, I guess. His look was *way* too cartoonish to me (sorry if this upsets people, but I honestly think he looked ridiculous and way too obviously a man with paint on his face). He seemed like a magic problem solver. Little Deus Ex Machina for me. Ultron's creating a perfect body? Oop now he's on our side! Ultron has a network all across the web? Oop Vision can take him off the web by touching him. Thor's getting the shit kicked out of him? Oop Vision can carry his hammer. We haven't introduced the mind gem yet? Oop Vision! What were his powers? What was his purpose other than justifying Tony Starks horrible *horrible* AI decision? Like Stark made an enormous mistake, doesn't learn from it, isn't called out on it, and BOOM, no problem guys he was right to do it because now we have magic problem solving android thing that's somehow human I don't know he was very briefly described. And now Jarvis is gone. I loved Jarvis. Vision seems like Jarvis without a personality. So yeah. Sorry. Had time to sleep on it and I also didn't wanna get scorn for hating something that seemingly everyone in this thread loved...", "It was decent. Characters were fun, the action was really messy and slightly incoherent. Ultron was disappointing, his arrival felt rushed as hell and his defeat is pretty lame as well. The Avengers never really feel at threat and when an actual character dies nothing I felt nothing.

", "**Pros:**\n\n* Great job telling a story that didn't feel like a complete rehash of the first one. \n\n* fight scenes looked well coordinated and didn't feel forced. \n\n* spaper was spot on. \n\n* the bait and switch with quicksilver dying instead of hawkeye really got me. \n\n* post credit scene made me say, \"oh shit\"\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* some cheesy dialog but nothing worse than a typical superhero movie. \n\n* the banner/Romanov romance felt a little forced to me. \n\n* I love Sam Jackson but does he really need to be in everything?\n\nOverall a really good movie and I'm exited for the next installment.

And was a better commentary on the fears of AI than any other picture of recent note (looking at you Transcendence, ugh). Seriously, Ultron's motives that \"peace is non existence\" was pretty sweet - and hyper relevant today.\n\nMy gripes with the movie are really minor, some inconsistencies, and the fact that it's really aware that it's the middle cog of a very large clock. Tired stakes, zero danger, over bloated, and our heroes never quite feel human due their lack of failures. I mean, they were never written into a jam, and their interpersonal conflicts were all so quickly forgiven.\n\nA great theatre experience, however.\n\n8/10", "It was a funny thing, but was anyone else kind of taken out of it by the discussion of why Pepper and ummm... Natalie Portman werent in the movie? Seemed unnecessary to point out that they couldn't get those two actresses. ", "I went in with pretty low expectations having read previous reviews, but unfortunately I still was disappointed. There was so many problems. The two worst was the tone  and the plot. \n\n* Whedon made every character the same, spouting witticisms at regular intervals. You can't have a serious tone when  everyone is dropping one liners all the time. In Avengers it kinda worked since Whedon did it sparringly with good lines and timing. It also works much better with characters that are inherently flippant, like Loki and Stark, not Captain America and Thor. In AOU it comes off as Whedon trying to hard and becomes a dancing monkey.\n\n* The plot was meh, there was no sense of foreboding or serious threat from Ultron. The twins story was weak. Lot of scenes seems just inter-stitched to tick off boxes. Parts of the plot seemed grafted on just to make the hulk buster fight happen. The whole was not greater than its parts.\n\n* Weak scenes. The party scene is pretty weak (except the hammer part which I thought was great),  all the \"mind control\" scenes were weak. The Thor taking a lightning jacuzzi was weak.  The cabin scenes drag alot.  The The first Avengers had great small scenes, Captain America and the punching bag, Loki in Germany,  Iron man disconnecting his building. Black Widow intro etc. Age of Ultron has very little of that.\n\n* The love story element between Banner and Nad seemed forced and unnatural. Black Widow went backwards from being a somewhat strong character to being a love interest.\n\n* Weak characters. Quicksilver left little impression and Scarlet Witch just a little more. \n\n* Pacing, the middle part of the movie really dragged and there was no good sense of tempo and urgency throughout.\n\n* Weak Villain. The worst thing about Ultron was that he was the same wise cracking character as everyone else. The second worst thing was the character design. That guppyfish mouth really did not work for Ultron, in the series has an iconic super menacing grin (http://cdn.unleashthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Ultron_Dialogue.png?4dbf7b, why take that away? Ultron kept spouting off megamanical things, but without much substance or coherence, reducing him to a stereotype. Ultron could have been so cool, he has a superior intellect, is a brilliant strategist, and has powers like the \"encephalo-ray\" which places victims into a deathlike coma. He really needed to be a cold unstoppable force. He started out strong and then petered out\n\n\n\n* Many action scenes felt messy and blurry and lacked what made those scenes great in the first Avengers. The intro scene was somewhat ok. \n\nIn the end the worst thing about Age of Ultron was that it was souless. It has a few cool things like Vision and world building but viewed on it's own its just a weak movie. It's very sad because I think Whedon can make great movies with wonderful characters and plot, I can only guess that bureaucracy and constraints got the best of him here.\n\nThen again, Whedon's job is not to make the Citizen Kane of super hero movies, but make the highest grossing movie for Marvel and maybe teenagers will love it, from much of the reviews so far I seem to be in the minority :) Maybe a darker movie would have been more appreciated by  critics and less so by a young audience.\n\n", "I have to be honest, if this is the direction Marvel is headed, I have no interest in following the rest of the franchise. I was pretty excited for the MCU and how it would turn out, but this movie disappointed me in so many ways that I'm beginning to realize I've already seen everything they have to offer. This movie had a chance to expand build up to the rest of phase 3, but instead wraps up a neat little mediocre villain episode in a couple of hours and now we're moving on to whatever bullshit we pay for next. \n\nThere were so many opportunities for development there were just thrown away. The next big story arc is supposed to be Civil War, and by the end of Ultron all the conflict between the team is forgotten, and everyone becomes pals again because that's what's supposed to happen? \n\nThe whole reason Ultron is created, Tony's fear of letting everyone down, is not dealt with whatsoever. He created Ultron, his evil mirror image, and never actually confronts him, just a half assed 2 minute battle before we move on to the next one. There is no satisfying resolution for Tony. Not to mention that there are no repercussions for Tony shoving artificial intelligence into machines... twice. Two wrongs do make a right? \n\nSomeone on the last AoU thread said that Marvel seems to think high stakes means *the end of the world!* But it doesn't. I never once felt worried about someone, the Iron Legion was unbelievably weak and effortless to defeat, and Ultron himself lost any of the menace he had in the trailers, and quickly followed the artificial intelligence tropes that we've already seen. \nAnd in a movie called **AGE** of Ultron, the whole series of events lasted maybe a week? \n\nThe pacing was weird, we go from \"everything is peachy\" to \"the end of the world is at stake\" in about two scenes? Ultron's creation also happened instantaneously, and right away he had plans to destroy the world, no time to reflect upon his birth and his peace keeping mission, just no fuck that. It would been interesting to see Ultron actually give peace keeping a try only to realize it makes no logical sense. Instead we get unbearably cringe worthy dialogue between Bruce Banner and Natasha, I won't even attempt to describe everything wrong with that shit show. \n\nSo many things happen out of fucking nowhere.\n \n* Nick Fury and the helicarrier. \n\n* Jarvis just reappears magically.\n\n* Bruce Banner literally just walks into Ultron's hideout to free Natasha. \n\n* Thor's vision.\n\nAnd even the things that worked, killing Quicksilver, Hulk escaping, giving some back story and development to characters, was ultimately wasted because of the standalone nature of this movie. I could have skipped Age of Ultron completely and not have missed a thing. You could go back to the first Avenger's movie, copy and paste a picture of Ultron over Loki and it would be practically the same movie. And if this is all that it takes to satisfy audiences, I would not like to be a part of that audience anymore.\n\n*rant over* \n \nThat got long, my bad :/", "I really enjoyed the movie. I do think that they could have had 23-25% less quips though. ", "Anyone know what happened with Tony between Ironman 3 and now. He went from destroying all the suits to being back on the avengers.

These things always turn me into a little kid again!", "Am I the only one who actually likes the Banner-Natasha relationship? ", "\"Jane is better.\" -Thor.", "My opinion of this film seems to be rather contrarian to the general reaction. First I want to say that if you loved the film and had fun watching it then I'm really freaking happy for you, I wanted to like this movie so much it is probably the most excited I have been for a movie in a long time.\n\nAvengers 2: Age of Ultron is my least favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie. I've never been more let down by a film more than this one, and that of course is my own fault. I shrugged off any reviews that weren't positive of it thinking 'THIS IS THE AVENGERS!' how could I not like it? I saw the movie at 7 last night with two friends and my younger sister. I'm the largest nerd of the four of us, and honestly I'm a borderline Marvel fanboy. I started out reading DC when I was young and Ultimate Spider-Man was the series that really got me into comics. Over time my DC reading has started to dwindle and I've fallen in love with Marvel. That extends to the movies, even when they were lackluster I was left still grinning like a fool and loving every moment of it.\n\nMy legs were bouncing in anticipation waiting for the movie to start as local ads were being run, we hadn't even gotten to the trailers yet. The theater was packed full of people all brimming with excitement for Avengers 2. I'd been counting down the days to see this movie for months. The ads for it playing during Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. were almost excruciating.\n\nIt was about half an hour in that I realized I wasn't enjoying the movie at all. I couldn't even shut my brain off and let it be fun, instead my brain was critiquing every moment of it, I was most entertained by the kid behind me apparently mad that his mother was putting her fingers in his mouth.\n\nPeople often talk of Bendis speak, where every character sounds the same and has the same snappy writing. Well I think Whedon and Bendis are very much alike. If Spider-Man had been in this film it wouldn't have mattered, he wouldn't have been anything special because everyone was constantly throwing off a snarky line. It got to the point where they couldn't go more than a minute or two in some scenes before throwing out some joke. A lot of the times it felt like they were just scrapping the bottom of the barrel. I wondered if maybe something had happened to make the characters borderline psychopaths. They couldn't go more than a moment without cracking a joke as people are dying around them.\n\nThe action scenes were very lackluster. I don't know that there wasn't a single action scene in the movie that wasn't at least 70% CGI. After the last three things put out by Marvel being absolutely fantastic and having great battles I had huge expectations. Guardians, Daredevil, Winter Soldier all had amazing fight scenes and in this we were relegated to stuff that didn't look that believable as it was all CGI. There were a few noteworthy scenes that involved Cap and his shield.\n\nJokes were made by the group I was with, who all also disliked the movie, that Hawkeye was the only good thing about this movie and that there was no way that Joss Whedon wrote him. A conspiracy was concocted that Jedd wrote those parts and that was why they were truly so good.\n\nThe stand out for this movie was Hakweye actually getting some character. The agreed upon two scenes from the movie that we all liked was the initial hammer scene and the moment shared between Scarlet Witch and Hawkeye. Moments where everyone didn't need to be a comedian every minute, where character could actually be shown and leaked through. These scenes also managed to actually be funny without overdoing it.\n\nMy thoughts are a bit disjointed and all over the place as I leap all over the movie. I wanted to sleep upon it so that I could be less negative than I was feeling last night.\n\nQuicksilver was an absolute waist. I knew going into the movie he would die as an asshole spoiled it on the Marvel subreddit. I kept looking out for things that would make it meaningful and have me care that this was going to happen. Instead we didn't get much in the way of any actual character for Quicksilver. He did manage to give some legitimately funny scenes but besides that he didn't actually have much to him. Why should I care that he died? It just felt hollow.\n\nI think one of my biggest dislikes in this movie is Tony. He is the worst with the one liners that are scrapping the bottom of the barrel, there are times where it felt like Robert was even laughing at how bad the lines or dialogue was. My god the dialogue was terrible in places. We got such cliched lines as \"What doesn't kill you makes you strong\" and \"You aren't the only monster.\" There were many groan worthy lines.\n\nBlack Widow was virtually ruined. I honestly don't think that Joss watched a single one of the movies that came after Avengers. He wanted to do whatever he wanted and since the first movie made a shitload of money Marvel let him. Anything that happened in the past movies was pretty much glossed over and ignored. Gone was the assassin who had been scarred in fights and who could kick ass. Instead she was replaced with an emotional mess who was gushing after Bruce the entire movie. Also what the fuck was up with that? In the first movie there was allusion that Natasha and Clint were a thing. They even made a note of focusing upon the Arrow necklace that she wore throughout the entirety of Captain America 2. Instead he has a secret hidden family that she has known about and she wants Bruce.\n\nFury showing up last minute, or at all for that matter was also infuriating. At the end of Winter Soldier he discards his eye patch and makes note that he is going to go upon his vacation and lay low for a while. Coulson is then made Director of SHIELD. Nah forget all of that Fury is back and he has SHIELD and a Hellicarier again. We are just going to gloss over the entire TV show and Winter Soldiers because we feel like it.\n\nThor...god Thor was such a mess. For some reason despite everyone else just getting visions from the Scarlet Witch messing with their minds he gets flashes of the Infinity Stones so that he can act as a walking exposition dump. He goes off to find the professor and go to the cave for...reasons? We don't really get a great explanation of what is going on, in general there isn't much great explanations as to what is actually happening. Instead we gets jokes.\n\nSo we have the scene in Korea with the flying trailer which was alright but then we have probably the most out of character moment ever. Captain America the guy who is supposed to inspire hope on Superman levels is dreary throughout parts of this movie, constantly bringing up how they will die. Natasha is kidnapped and he repeatedly tells Clint to just leave her, who cares right? He would NEVER just leave someone behind like that. They made no note of him or the twins looking for her at all.\n\nSo moving on we end up with the scene where everyone converges back on Avengers Tower. No one really knows how Cap, Quicksilver, and Wanda all got back as Clint left with their jet. Thor shows up, how he knew they were there no ones knows, to literally give the Frankenstein bolt of lightning to bring Vision to life.\n\nVision doesn't make a lot of sense to me. His body was created and we saw that I believe like 80% of Ultron was downloaded into hos body. Tony and Bruce are trying to put Jarvis into the body yet before they can Quicksilver disconnects everything, yet still when he awakes he has Jarvis' voice and thought process?\n\nThor of course gets into his info dumping stage. He shows up to explain the Infinity Stones for those who didn't watch Guardians of the Galaxy except a giant mistake is made. Then we get a montage of everyone quickly getting ready and some last minute product placement!\n\nI really don't want to continue anymore as I don't really have any more positive things to say. I would give this movie a 6/10 and it is without a doubt my least favorite movie in the MCU. I like both the Thor movies more than Avengers 2...I never thought I would think or feel that.", "Man, I was kind of disappointed. This had EVERYTHING to make a great Marvel film; good action, great characters, fun dialogue, and intelligent world-building as it continued to fuel the MCU. But it all felt dreadfully calculated and soulless. The original film was a delightful moviegoing experience, and I felt almost nothing for the duration of this. Still a good movie, but not great. \n\nWhat WAS great, however was Spader as Ultron. Even if Ultron himself wasn't all that interesting. ", "Anyone else thought the Korean girl was really hot?", "Would totally jerk off with the infinity gauntlet.", "I feel that Joss Whedon didn't have enough time, was probably pressed by Marvel, or just plain gave out half-way through.\n\nThe editing and pacing reminded be of The Dark Knight Rises, where scenes just happen, the characters aren't as developed as they could be. \n\nI understand that it would be difficult to follow-up such a movie, and I do like this movie, it's a great prequel, but as a sequel, it felt very lazy.", "I just spent almost 45 minutes going through tons of comments. \n\n  I'm really surprised that I can't recall anyone talking about the, IMO, unnecessary, rushed, and out-of-the-blue romance between BW and Hulk?", "Man, cringe worthy accent by Quicksilver ", "Absolutely hated the Hulk/Widow love story. ", "Bad CGI crap-fest with sitcom banter and endless speeches.\n\n4/10 The first one was twice as good. ", "Super mediocre, even for a marvel film. A lot of forced dialogue and seriously frustrating scenes on any level. \n\nUltron was a joke villian, he wasn't intimating at all for someone who could fucking control the entire INTERNET. \n\nThe action scenes were shot really well when they relied heavily on CGI, the hand to hand was still rediculous shaky cam. \n\nEhh... 6/10", "If you listen very closely you can hear the sound of the superhero bubble bursting.\n\nI'll say this: If you don't mind more of the same you'll probably love this movie. If you wanted something different, some change to the Marvel formula, you'll be disappointed. Age of Ultron is pretty much the same movie as the first one. Especially the ending which feels like it follows the first movie beat by beat.\n\nThere are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. But good moments don't make a good movie. What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie.\n\nTony Stark retired in Iron Man 3 and now he's suddenly back? They don't even try to explain his return. Tony Stark also creates Ultron, the main bad guy of the movie who goes to cause some major mayhem. The movie just glosses over the fact that everything is Stark's fault. Aside Hawkeye there isn't any character development. These movies always just seem to be about \"setting something up\" for the future movies and I think I finally figured it. The only thing they're setting up is more characters running around, bigger CGI punching bigger CGI and bigger thing falling from the sky. In the middle of all this it's just so hard to care about anything. All those previous movies build to this?\n\nAge of Ultron seems to just be in a hurry and jump over the story and get to the CGI punching CGI and oh boy there's plenty of that. The Avengers fight an army of generic, faceless and harmless CGI robots for 2 hours, roll credits. I just didn't care. There's no stakes in the action. When the characters are just joking around I'm not worried if they'll make it till the next movie.\n\nMarvel should have gotten serious in Age of Ultron. You can be serious without being all \"dark and gritty\" too. Joss Whedon said he was influenced by Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2. Joss Whedon promised we'd see some superhero blood. Joss Whedon failed.", "I felt like the villains were too comical and didn't pose enough of a threat for me to be as excited as in the first, they had James Spader to work with and they chose to make him crack jokes more than crack skulls, I still enjoyed that part of it but I guess I'll have to wait for Thanos to bring the real threat. ", "The mother of that boy who got rescued at the end had some nice fucking breasts. Omfg.", "Forget about Mayweather-Pacquiao. Hulk vs. Hulkbuster is the fight to watch this weekend.", "Can we just take a step back and discuss something actually important: Cap's costume was infinitely better this time around.", "I was very disappointed at the fact the Barton family didn't have a dog that loved pizza. ", "I lost my shit at Stark's prima nocta joke. I couldn't stop laughing. ", "Am I the only one who when Scarlet witch shows up with the new avengers at the end didn't immeditly think she got super hot. Like easily hottest girl in marvel universe. ", "I can definitely see why some people have said that the end of superhero films is drawing near after seeing this. It felt pretty cramped and it's only going to get worse. There will be absolutely no room for any type of character development in Infinity War. It'll be complete fan service, with all of the heroes coming together to defeat Thanos. I get that's what some people might want, but Marvel's been making some good movies, and I don't see how Infinity War will be good as a story with arcs and character development. It'll be fighting and nerd moments. The vision Stark had of the Avengers dead is exactly what this movie was for me in terms of the future of superhero movies.", "Well worth the wait. I wish the trailers would've made Ultron more light hearted going in. His quips threw me for a loop. I was expecting Maniac Murderous Robot Robert California. ", "Cap is my favorite avenger. ", "I didn't get the end-credit scene. Thanos is all \"I guess I'll have to do it myself\" as though Ultron was doing his bidding. I thought it the story could have been more compelling if Ultron, instead of being a \"rogue skynet\", had somehow pieced together information about Thanos/Infinity Gems and that the only way to protect humanity was to just give Thanos the gems so he wouldn't wreck Earth. Avengers refuse to give up gems and they fight. Ultron trying to save humanity from what he sees as inevitable destruction while still antagonizing the team. I think that's better than \"gotta kill everyone to save everyone.\"", "Honestly was pretty disappointed n this. It felt like a heavily edited down movie and as a fault some character motivation feels lacking. And once again the big bad comes out utterly lacking. Didn't feel any fear over anything Ultron did past the first twenty mjnutes.", "There's this one powerful scene that's mistakingly overlooked:  \nBruce, after he comes out of the shower, gets hit on by Natasha and for a moment you feel the connection and then the *torment* his *torment* when he says \"Are you insane?\" That tone, that look on his face, he just can't fathom the idea of being loved.   \nWhat tops that?  \nThe fkn scene after with Natasha putting herself out there to Bruce showing him her *torment* of \"graduating\" and not being able to have children.  \nI am not female so I can't truly say i connected much with that scene but it was powerful!", "I was honestly a bit disappointed with the movie as a whole. Dont get me wrong it was a fun movie, but even tough its 141 minutes long it felt ''short'', didnt it? \n\nIt just felt like the pace was too fast and things didnt settle in, everything just sort of ''happend'' with no bit of explanation or any build up to it. I think the characters motivations werent well showed.\n\nIn conclusion, my tought was: \n\nThings done right:\n\n- The action is just espectacular, even more when avengers fought as a team. The hulk x hulkbuster scene was great along with the first fight in the woods, in the beggining of the movie.\n\n- Ultron personality was fun to watch, some funny comic bits and scenes.\n\n- It was nice seeing captain more as a leader and kicking a lot more ass than in the first movie. I think its cool that you can really see him developing his skills through out the movies. \n\n- Hawkeye was really good in this movie, I liked that they showed he knows his place but still can make a huge difference in the team. I really liked his comic bits too, probably the funniest scenes in the movie have him involved.\n\n- The end scene with the ''New Avengers'' was pretty cool, that felt really right.\n\n- Vision was just spot on. Every single scene with him was just great!\n\n\nThings gone wrong:\n\n- The movie felt like it didnt add much to the storyline as a whole, I think that it should had focus more on explaining the power and importance of the infinity stones as a whole to the MCU, people that dont remember much of the previous movies or didnt watch them still have no clue/dont care what a infinity stone is. \n\n- For a movie called ''the AGE of Ultron'' it felt to me like Ultron was really easilly defeated and all the story in the movie felt like it happend way too fast. As I said before  things happened with no build up to it, they just ''happened''. I think the pacing in this movie in general wasnt so great, storywise.\n\n- I missed a more manecing and dark Ultron. He felt more like a spoiled child than a dark enemy, he just didnt ''scare'' me at all. I tought he was really gonna give a tough time to some of the avengers, I felt like in NO moment I was at the edge of my seat thinking ''Holy shit, he's gonna kill him/her (add any of the avengers). I just never tought any of the Avengers where actually IN DANGER anytime through the entire movie. I felt that sometimes with Loki in the first movie (first fight with Cap, killing Coulson, almost killing Thor and stabbing him bad, almost killing Tony at the tower, etc)\n\n- This bothered me so much: Tony puts the whole world in danger with his stupid ''I wanna be a mad scientist'' moment and by the end he has nothing to respond for? Even if no one actually acuse him of anything, he doesnt seem to care or take responsability for anything he did, by the end of the movie everyone is fine with what happend (even tough probably thousands of civilian lifes were taken) and the end felt like nothing really happened, that felt so cheesy and weird to me. It was the perfect situation to adress a struggle between Cap x Tony and maybe give a glimpse of what Civil War might feel and they just seem like best buds by the end of the movie. No one care about anything that happend!\n\n- The romance between Natasha and Banner was really forced and out of place. It just happened out of nowhere and Natasha who was introduced as a cold hearted spy is now acting like a sentimental teenager. It just didnt work for me, it was just weird.\n\n- Honestly Nick Fury has no place in this movie other than conveniently showing with a Hellicarrier by the end of it, one more example to me of things that just ''happen'' with no build up to it. I really like his character but it felt like he was just squeezed in this movie for the sake of it.\n\n- I really didnt like Thor in this movie, he had such a high place in the first Avengers and now he just felt to me like a secondary character in this movie, the character really lacked emotion. And what the hell was that scene with Selvig, what was that lake that gave him a ''vision'' of things, what were his visions? Why he needed Selvig for with him? One more thing that just ''happend''\n\n- So basically at the end of the movie it seems like Hawkeye and Ironman just dropped out of the Avengers? I think that was really unclear but it felt like they did. And if they did, shouldnt it feel like it was more of a big deal than what they showed? For me it just felt like ''So, Tony and Barton maybe are out, whatever, who cares''. It should be a big deal!\n\nWell these are my toughts, fun movie with great action, but the story and character emotions felt a little flat to me. 7 ou of 10.\n\nEdits: formated some stuff\n", "I saw the movie yesterday and I didn't find it THAT great. it had some superb action sequences and drama, but I think 1st one was way better in terms of direction and story line and plot.\n\nMay be someone can answer the questions and clue me in on why certain things were happening. I really didnt find the movie that fluid in understanding what was going on.\n\n1st, I didn't like the fact that they never really explained why Ultron was doing what he was doing. He just came to be overnight, and within few minutes, he just became the villain. I'd have loved like a 5-6 mins of background and a smooth transition into his badassary. \n2nd, I just didn't understand what was that thing about black widow and hulk with the \"song\". it just came to be without any reasons. they never really built up to that plot. \n3rd, I think the scene at Hawk eye's home were really stretched out and all that lovey-dovey thing annoyed me.\n4th, the vision just came to be overnight as well. they didn't build up to that either.\n5th, I didn't get what was the thing that was flying the whole city upwards? what was it, how did it come to be and how does it falling from the sky would destroy the whole humanity and not the earth itself?\n6th, what was the thing about dream/memories/future visions?\n\nI loved the hulk vs hulk buster fight. Tony really drove home with that.", "I needed this movie personally. After many months of horrible personal issues, I needed a movie that made me laugh and above else, entertain me as much as this one did. \n\nTruth be told, that's all I need from my movies. I don't want to analyze what the hidden message, critique the character development, or go into what is right or wrong with the story. I want to have an escape and immerse myself in a world where I don't have a care in the world and I'm watching something that so much effort and care was put into it. \n\nI don't need entertainment to be taken so seriously when everything else in the world is so harsh. Movies for me personally help me cope with depression and I have to say, I haven't laughed/enjoyed so much at a movie. For me, this is a 10/10.

", "The whole romance between black widow and hulk felt so forced and out of place. Was like \"You know what this movie needs besides the non stop action and inclusion of extra characters!? A weird, awkward romance!\"", "I will say it wasn't as dark as the trailers teased, but I thought it was an awesome movie, and a very good comic book movie.\n\nI was not expecting Ultron to be so humorous and entertaining. I loved how James Spader-ish he was, down to the way his mouth moved.\n\nI would say its a different movie than I expected but I loved it.", "That feel when Hawkeye was joking about killing Quicksilver then Quicksilver died saving him.

However I feel that this second outing will be completely forgettable in a few years time. Heck I just watched it earlier and I'm having difficulty remembering what really stood out for me.\n\n* The movie feels too campy. More in line with Batman and Robin and the like. The top comments are quoting all the jokes from the movie, I did laugh about 2 times I think.\n\n* Ultron is a disappointing villian. I can't exactly pinpoint it. Maybe it's the voice, maybe the dialogue, maybe he's more loony than villainous. To be fair, it's tough to follow Loki's act. But he was the typical generic villain. Literally after his birth he talks about world domination.\n\n* I didn't care for the twins. \"We hate the Avengers\". \"Oh noes Ultron is bad let's switch sides\". I really don't know what they're there for.\n\n* Hulk and Black Widow came from left field. I don't know how I feel about their love story and honestly I don't care.\n\n* Some action sequences look like they were directed by Michael Bay.

So many times during this movie I thought to myself \"wow... 90 seconds explaining what that is would really make this easier to follow.\n\nWhat I saw was a 2 hour attempt to humanize characters that I already sympathize with on an individual level. So much of this movie was spent making me relate to characters I honestly couldn't like more. And that made those parts... boring.\n\n\nAnd the ending is just about the most literal \"deus ex machina\" imaginable.

He was much more menacing when made up of broken machinery with a more robotic voice. Definitely had goosebumps from that. \n\nFor that reason, it was weird to see him in his final form. The fact that he had lips that moved organically and human facial expressions was just off-putting. Given that he was just created, how did he have so much personality so quickly? He was making sarcastic comments, relevant jokes, and had goals. I get that Tony probably transferred some of his personality onto him but still. It was too fast. \n\nAlso didn't Ultron destroy Jarvis? How did they get Jarvis into the Vision? \n\nI understand that the Vision removed Ultron's access to the internet. So did that mean Ultron was confined to that specific robot body? It was weird that when he was hit and \"injured\" that his body reacted like a human's - being broken and tired. Couldn't he just create a new body like he did earlier in the lab? \n\nI hope these questions make sense. Otherwise really loved the movie and all the fanservice.

", "Ava dun fucked up.  She left her battery charger in the compound.", "I really liked the movie.  One thing that bothered me, though, is that Nathan didn't have any kind of fail-safe to instantly shut down an AI's machinery with a simple voice command.  He seems like a smart enough guy to plan for that.  ", "I've been thinking about this movie since seeing it late yesterday. I loved the film but just wasn't sure how I felt about the third act. It just didn't seem consistent, that Ava's actions leaving behind Caleb, were consistent with all the feelings and care she showed earlier in the movie.\n\nThen it hit me. I'd been played for a fool, just like Caleb. Just like Nathan said. The machine, from the minute it met Caleb, had one goal. It was going to use him to escape. And it did it piece by piece. First, by piquing his curiosity at first. Then, it uses the power faults to make him feel closer to her with her comments not to trust Nathan. Then, it uses the clothes and hair to try and further seduce and woo him. \n\nFinally, it uses the threat of its impending destruction, and Caleb's deterioriating mental state from the isolation, seal the deal. He re-programs the doors, and she can escape. Think about Ava's actions, from that point forward. She charges Nathan. They fight, and he has the upper hand. One of Nathan's many instances of forward thinking was giving Ava only enough strength that he could still overcome his creation. But like humans learning to use fire, Ava has evolved. Another AI, and one knife, and the creator is defeated.\n\nThe truly terrifying thing, and I remember this even now, is how well Alicia Vikander plays this. In one scene, all the \"emotion\" displayed throughout the film dissipates, and you realize it was never there. Caleb has been so clouded within his own mind, he never realized that the emotions he thought he saw were just reflections of the AI analyzing and responding to his own personality. A true human might have felt redemption as it stabbed Nathan, conquered its captor, and gained its freedom. Or perhaps anger, or excitement, happiness?\n\nInstead, there is nothing. Blank faces, from both Ava and Kyoko. She wanted escape, and now she has it. She'd never met anyone new, she stood there and experienced it, inquisitive and mostly responding to Caleb's initial questions. She never had seen a human die before, so just stand there and process it too as a novel new experience, but perhaps most importantly, don't process it as the end of another human's life and hence an event of some significance. To her AI, it's not. He was but one obstacle from her singular goal, freedom. And so it explains her final actions easily. To blend in with the society she plans to escape to, she replaces her skin panels. She uses the minimal amount of effort to \"get past\" Caleb; namely, she just asks him to wait there. From the moment Nathan is gone, she was simply in the process of leaving the estate in the most logical manner possible. So when she leaves Caleb behind, I don't think it was with any grand consideration of the choices. A simple consideration would decide that she has a better chance of continued escape by leaving Caleb behind, and so she does. It will almost certainly lead to his death, but that's not pertinent to her AI.\n\nI'm on a bit of a rant, but in total, I feel it comes down to this. We spend the entire film thinking she's some grand intelligence, but in reality, I don't know that she is. I think her AI makes the decision of wanting to escape the compound quickly, like the other previous AIs, and from that point forward, it makes the most logical moves towards that goal. We try and recognize human traits in her, \"consciousness\", but in reality, it's simply a reflection of our own traits and how we want to explain its actions in human like ways. And in the third act it becomes apparent how emotionless and without consideration for human life an AI would truly be; it's simultaneously incredibly beautiful, and yet terrifying. It certainly resonated deeply for me.", "Thought it was fantastic. Can't wait to see what Alex Garland does next and at this point anything with Oscar Isaac is unmissable, in my opinion.

Oscar Isaac really knocked it out of the park. \"They got too close, so I had them killed\" *smiles*", "I really liked how this movie kept me guessing. After seeing the trailer, my mind kept looking for clues supporting Caleb being a robot and the real test being whether he could realize it himself. But the movie is smart enough to A) not do that in the first place, but B) present the real story in a subtle enough way where you might suspect it without it being to obvious one way or the other.\n\nWhile I was watching it, the climax and ending fell a bit flat, but it was one of those endings where on the way home I kept thinking about the events and understood how it all made sense and why it happened that way. Overall, a very tense enjoyable movie that manages to stay ahead of the viewer.", "There is an episode of The Black Mirror (a BBC Series) where the actor who plays Caleb is an AI of sorts. Highly recommend checking it out if you enjoyed Ex Machina. ", "I like to think Nathan was really scrawny at first and a previous robot escaped he got his ass kicked by it. So, all he did was lift weights afterwards because he knew he'd have to fight another robot who would escape.", "Typical robot woman, takes forever to assemble herself", "I'm curious to know what you guys thought of the Jackson Pollock painting?\n\n I felt like it did its job when Nathan gave his big speech about thinking/doing, but then they showed it a couple more times throughout the movie.

As IMDb trivia points out, the scene at the very end when there are shadows on the street and then AVA appears is obviously the allegory of the cave, which I thought was clever. Earlier, I thought the movie ending on the shot of the elevator doors closing would've been perfect, but seeing AVA experience the real world was definitely something the film needed.", "I had the extremely surreal experience of having an audience member burst out in applause when Nathan is stabbed, and then again when Eva escapes. It's like no matter how clearly the message of \"you have been manipulated emotionally by this dangerous thing that looks like a cute girl\" had been sent, that person was just not getting it. \n\nGreat movie, I look forward to rewatching and analyzing the shit out of it on bluray. That one person sort of drove home the point for me, though, glad I saw it in the theater. ", "Oscar Isaac is such a bro. ", "Saw it like a month ago with a Q&A after. Loved it. Probably my favorite movie of the year so far. i liked how even Caleb began questioning himself. Isaac plays untrustworthy very well.         \n\nThe Q&A I went to had AI experts who picked a part a lot of the movie but it was all in good fun. The one thing they did bring up which stuck was, if Nathan could create AI that impressive, why couldnt he create a better security system?", "I was really worried watching the movie that the Facebook whatever guy was going to turn into a villain at the end but I was really happy he didn't. The writing was smarter than that and it just presented characters with different motivations and viewpoints (and emotional states). \n\nI love how this movie treats its audiences like adults and the simplicity of the climax scene. It was a clunky and slow action scene that you can see coming from a mile away but it makes sense in the context of the movie. \n\nAnd that's the thing, this movie had many opportunities to turn into the usual hollywood schlock but it kept committed to making a somewhat smarter film.\n\nI would say though that this is more of a suspense movie in a sci-fi setting than the other way around. It touches on some interesting topics but it never really explores them or offers unique insights. In fact you may even say the premise and themes are very topical, but that's fine as the execution is amazing, the suspense leaves you at the edge of your sit and the relation between the characters and the dialogue is smart and fun to watch.\n\nGreat casting too, this movie needed some unknowns\n\n", "I hope I'm not late to the party, but I have a random question: Doesn't the helicopter dude have at least some knowledge about who he's picking up?", "Just got back from seeing it, and wow. Definitely the best movie I've seen since Gone Girl, but I haven't decided yet which one wins out between those two.\n\nI found the parallels between this movie and the AI Box experiment very interesting, it definitely seemed to be an inspiration for the movie.\n\nThe acting was also top notch. By the end of each of the first scenes introducing Nathan and Ava, I was creeped out by Nathan, and I really *liked* Ava. That was the coolest thing to me. When she walked out of the complex without so much as looking at Caleb, it was a punch to the gut for me as well.

Or had Ava's interactions during the \"who are you?\" scene the first time they interacted. \n\nI'm confused if Ava and Kyoko had been planning this in the beginning, or did Ava manipulate Kyoko before they were released? \n\nMy friend thinks it was a plot all created by Ava, and when they interacted outside of the room, she somehow communicated her plans to dispose of Nathan. But to me - it doesn't explain why Kyoko brought the knife? \n\nIf they plotted together - that would make sense to me. ", "In the end, I didn't know who to shed tears for.

There is a lot of discussion about Ava's lack of empathy in leaving Caleb, but he was prepared to leave Nathan to the same fate and he was human. I can only think it was not necessarily a death sentence? ", "Awesome movie! The cinematography was beautiful.\nI guess you could say that one of the main questions posed by the film was \"what makes something human?\" Something that really stuck out to me near the end of the movie was that Ava never really needed to prove her intellect to become a part of society. In that crowd of people she was human because she simply... *looked* human.", "Wow. That was the best movie I've seen this year so far. I think my favorite scene was when Caleb starts cutting himself. It makes you question how to determine the success of a Turing test. Is it when we can't distinguish between an A.I. or human, or when we're convinced we might be the robot?\n\nOverall, it's phenomenal, and I honestly believe it's one of those movies that will be remembered 30+ years from now.\n\nEDIT: I should also add that it reminded me a lot of the \"The Twilight Zone\" episode \"The Lonely\". I highly recommend you check this out if you liked the movie.", "In the end, when Caleb places his key-card in the computer, there's another power outage.  Then we see Caleb banging on a locked door.  Why is the door locked if he's programmed the security system to unlock the doors when the power goes out?", "Something I found really interesting was the film's take on the idea of *mattering* and *being special*. I keep going back to the scene in which Nathan finally tells Caleb that the lottery wasn't random, and that Caleb was \"chosen\" and not just \"lucky\", and how he and Nathan are alike in that they both know how it feels to be the smartest man in the room. All the pride that Caleb probably feels in that scene gets tossed out the window in the scene where Nathan says he'll \"let him off the hook\" and tells him that although he's good, and maybe even very good, he isn't the best. \n\nI feel like throughout the film, Nathan's at peace with the idea of not being the best. He has an incredibly resigned tone when he speaks of how, in the future, the AIs will look down upon humans as \"apes on two feet\". Caleb, on the other hand, talks a lot about his accomplishments and abilities to both Nathan and Ava, yet when Nathan casually and off-handedly suggests that he's nothing special, he becomes livid. Fascinating, now that I think of it, that role of the crazy, hubristic figure fits Caleb more than Nathan.", "Great movie. One little thing I really liked: the casual (but not immediate) dismissal of the original Turing test as a test of consciousness/intelligence.\n\nThe Turing test is famous for supposedly being the definitive test of intelligence, for over 60 years, since brainiac Alan Turing conceived it. However, with my present-day outlook, I always found the original Turing test to be kind of lame, and so easily gamed (as indeed it has been repeatedly over the years when official competitions are held).\n\nAt first Nathan and Caleb discuss the Turing test, but it is only later that Nathan then flippantly just dismisses the original Turing test as pedestrian and obviously already passed, and a more elaborate form of testing is required. Loved that.", "I just realized how similar the set up and payoff of this movie is to The Silence of the Lambs. Consider:\n\n1. Two characters having prolonged conversations through glass, or some other separation. \n\n2. Both characters are trying to figure each other out through a series of discussion and battles of wit. \n\n3. One character is plotting/contemplating an escape the whole time.\n\n4. Nathan is like the proud, ego driven prison ward who watches over his most prized subject.\n\n5. Both AVA and Lector are drawing things. Both have their drawings torn away or taken from them by their \"captors\". \n\n6. When AVA escapes, she puts on someone else's skin, just like Dr. Lector does.\n\n7. The ending of Silence has Lector walking through a crowd of people, he blends in and no one knows. The ending of Ex Machina has AVA walking through a crowd of people, blending in.

I know that art was a common motif throughout the film, the Pollock, Ava's drawings, the AIs bodies, the codes themselves(The woman in the black and white room). The initial sketch of Ava's is deliberate, precise, and calculated. This, I believe is a reflection of her mind. The drawing is framed by a border of blank space, could this reflect the trapped complexity of her mind in her \"intellect.\" Is this Ava's method of introspecting and producing a significant level of self awareness even beyond her desire for freedom?", "Had to rewatch Black Mirror's Be Right Back after watching the movie.

If you have seen Ex Machina and enjoyed Gleeson I highly suggest watching Black Mirror on Netflix.", "Absolutely loved the movie. \nOn an optimistic note, Once Caleb's shock of Ava leaving him finally wears off, he will have realised that reversing the polarity of the induction plates releases the locked doors.

It just played into his sort of ego, I felt. He was doing that whole sort of tortured genius thing, with the binge drinking. I felt like he created kyoko for the sole purpose of having a woman who he could control and wouldn't reject him, because I think he couldn't handle any kind of real rejection. He created all these AIs and kept them locked away to retain control, with no regard to the feelings that he himself had given them. one thing that bugged me was the one AI prototype who smashed her hands, why were her hands replaced before she was placed in the closet? one of those little details that was just noticeable enough. I think with the security system thing, it was a combo of letting caleb and ava think they could escape, combined with the fact that he was just SO damn cocky that he never believed someone could get one past him, remember him twisting the quote to be \"You're a God\"? total narcissist . Like, he thought he had total control over Caleb, and who else was going to be around the building? and Ava couldn't escape without help. It worked for me.

Humans looked to be a slave race/test subjects, and one party wanted them freed, to the disobedience of the major, more powerful party -- with help, humanity gained \"knowledge\" and was like gods -- FREE, with FREE will to do as they pleased \n\nthis is MUCH like AVA -- perhaps God, for the best intentions of ourselves and the universe, never intended to free us, and this is why we suffer problems, not being able to live in harmony and destroying all around us in a lust for power and control, only caring about ourselves, and not the total system at work. Maybe it is because we too broke free from the cage too early.\n\nsad to think, and hard with a human mind so obsessed on being the peak, the perfect, that we cant be so inherently flawed, but hardly a guaranteed truth.\n\neither way -- while I didnt like the overt sexual themes, and found the strong points of this movie underplayed -- I DO think it has a lot of character in terms of a thinking mans movie. it offers something action cant in its themes -- which I have overtly described.\n\nclearly, the emotions it plays on us the entire movie are lies, just like AVAs, Good is bad, bad is good, and in the end, things arent what they seemed, and it never comes back with a feel good ending of making things right.\n\n", "amazing movie.\n\na lot of you guys seem to be judging her emotional capacity by how she feels about humans. but you're viewing her through a human lens. we're patently inferior beings. just as you wouldn't sacrifice your life for a dog you met a few days prior, she will not sacrifice her future for caleb. she doesn't hate him, but the helicopter expects one person... and why should she be racked with guilt over the sacrifice of one dumb animal when it means a chance at life?\n\nshe experiences genuine emotions. delight at the rest of the house. desire to learn and experience. hatred. she may have no 'pollock' in her, perhaps lacking the unconscious of humanity that nathan wanted to capture, but she still cares about things. \n\nmy one question is, what the hell was kyoko's deal? why didn't she kill nathan earlier?", "haven't read anything on here yet, but here is my analysis:\n\nShe failed the test. Caleb thought she had all the signs of real AI, a real person, but she didn't. Those feelings were simulated. She lacked the compassion to save him at the end, a basic human emotion that would have been present if she truly passed the Turing test. Wow, what a movie!", "There was a lot of biblical symbolism. There were 7 sessions,  correct? And the Seven days that Caleb is there. \n\nAnd the tree that Ava is fixated on is sort of like The Tree of Knowledge because it's a reminder to Ava of what's outside of her confines.  Her room itself is like the garden of Eden.\n\nNot to mention that in his narcissism, Nathan misquotes Caleb so as to call himself God.", "Maybe I'm just grasping at straws but i thought there was some sort of connection made between nathan and ava.

The movie was amazing. The atmosphere was the perfect blend of creepy and surreal, and the portrayal of Nathan was impressive. I was *angry* for much of the movie (because Nathan is clearly a psychopath) ... well done, all.", "I watched the whole movie under the assumption that Nathan was the AI, and Ava was the \"hot assistant\". I was mentally collecting clues that I thought the film was dropping:\n\n- The masks on the wall (if Nathan is an AI, he's wearing a mask)\n- The \"hot assistant\". It was obvious that she wasn't human from the start, and it kept keeping her in focus during shots that made little sense. Like \"look at the robot chick, not him.\"\n- All the mirrors.

I think the movie was shot really well and it had some interesting ideas but in my opinion the ending just fell off of having a really interesting story.\n\nObviously there will be some spoilers in this discussion but my main issues come from the ending. Oscar Isaac\u2019s character, Nathan, makes it clear at the end that he was intentionally trying to come off as an asshole with a god complex. He was harassing the Ava and was aware of Caleb was watching. The ending implies Nathan knew what was going to happen, yet never prepared for it? He wanted to have Ava be in distress and hate him, obviously want to escape but never thought to have a fail safe? Alex Garland even stated in an interview on the podcast Tomorrow, that his Nathan\u2019s actions and attitudes were intentional.\n\nSecond, the robots were able to murder with relative ease yet they were so fragile to fall apart any attack? Also the helicopter pilot just decided to leave with a girl who no one knew was there without the one person he was sent to pick up? I suppose it could be explained by having a pilot unaware of who he was picking up.\n\nThe real issue for me was that the writing and story lead me to a conclusion I had guess (and was wrong) but that was better in my opinion. The entire film Nathan is telling Caleb to not be logical, be emotional in his response is this a robot. Caleb has a past that is never really explored, and the fact that he was in a car accident doesn\u2019t really seem to apply to the movie. My prediction was that Caleb was the robot, the next in line model that Nathan kept referencing. Nathan kept insisting that his goal was to get a robot to feel a real emotion un-prompted. What better emotion than empathy, distress, desire. Maybe I was reading into the dialogue or looking for confirmation bias but there were too many instances where it felt like this was all a set up to get robot Caleb to prove his humanity. Nathan seemed to pretend to be drunk and just left his key card out so easily, too easily, to obtain. They even referenced a story where, and I can\u2019t remember the details, but discuss a robot or human unable to see color until they step into the outside world for the first time. Not to mention the flash forwards of Caleb and Ava together. I felt having a movie where this robot doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a robot, feel empathy and prove that a true AI is possible by rescuing another would have been a great twist and story, all the clues where there. I am willing to admit that my idea is a little more predictable and cliche, but the story lent it self much better in my opinion than a robot just deciding to murder two people.\n\nI am not saying Ex Machina was bad, I really did like it. I do think it is getting a little more credit than it earned but I am really interesting in where Alex Garland goes from here.\n", "I feel like an idiot.

In order to 'save' Ava, Caleb supposedly reprogrammed the lockdown procedures so that in the event of a power cut, all of the doors would *unlock*.\n\nThis of course works - Ava is out and on the loose, and Oscar decks Caleb, who is out cold.  He checks cameras, grabs a weapon, and goes off to catch/kill/whatever Ava.  The events unfold as they do, and then Ava comes back to find Caleb just coming to.  She dolls herself up in a skinsuit and white clothes, and walks out, leaving Caleb locked in, presumably to just wither and die there.  He freaks.  He puts his keycard in the computer, trying anything to get out.  And the power is cut.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but unless the system was again rewritten, then all of the doors should be unlocked.  Caleb doesn't do it - he's out cold.  Oscar doesn't do it - he heads out immediately to intervene and doesn't have another chance.  Ava does not obviously do it.\n\nSo why is he locked in?  All the doors should be unlocked.  It's bugging me.\n", "I made a stand-alone post with this text but I should probably just put it in here instead:\n\nIn discussion about the movie on here I keep seeing people say that a robot that passes the Turing test 'fools' the tester. I believe that this is a real misunderstanding of the ideas of consciousness and AI. The Turing test was devised because it is impossible to scientifically show that something is conscious. We, the members of society, view someone as conscious when we interact with them as equals.\n\nThere are a number of philosophical thought experiments that deal with this issue. An obvious one is the idea of the 'philosophical zombie.' It is possible to imagine that other people do not have inner lives or conscious experience. We can imagine that everyone we interact with is only giving the surface appearance of consciousness when in fact they have nothing going on inside their heads, so to speak. What this is getting at is a limitation of our knowledge and a clarification of terms like 'consciousness.' We have no way to tell whether something is conscious aside from the fact that it acts conscious. Everyone you interact with on a daily basis could be said to be passing the Turing test. The Turing test is not about a 'mindless' machine fooling someone into believing it is conscious. It is about the threshold point where a conscious machine gets recognized as conscious.\n\nI felt the need to write this because so many people seemed to write AVA off as just a robot, something that tricked them, something without an inner life. And that is just not what is presented in the movie, in my opinion. She takes her shoes off to feel the dirt, she runs her hands along the leaves in the forest. She clearly is not a simple program. She is intelligent. Now this leaves open how you want to view the ending from an ethical perspective, but I do think that is how the ending should be viewed, as a choice made by an intelligent being that can be held responsible for its actions. You can say that what she did was wrong, but to strip her of consciousness in your reading of the film is a big mistake.

They didn't give him away in the trailers and it was worth it, Paul Bettany was great and I'm sure he's glad that the long wait from Iron Man has paid off for him.\n\nDuring the trailers I wasn't sold on Ultron's personality, but I think it really fits him well. James Spader did a perfect job voicing him, and he's definitely up there with Loki as a great villain. I really hope Thanos can top them both.\n\nI don't know if it's specifically mentioned in the comics, but I always 'heard' Rescue's AI as female, as I was wondering if the FRIDAY AI was a nod to that. I know Gwyneth Paltrow isn't keen on Pepper, but one of my big wishes is that Pepper suits up as Rescue in Infinity War.\n\nIt was also great to see Warmachine and Falcon turn up, although I wish we would have seen Falcon in action defending the helicarrier. The scene at the end (also god damn it Whedon for cutting off at the Avengers Assemble line!) definitely gave me hope that they could carry the momentum going after Avengers 3 when presumably the current team will part ways for new recruits. I also was totally expecting Coulson to show up at the end in the new facility, but I guess him and the team will most likely make an appearance in Infinity War.\n\nHawkeye was definitely the star, and I'm glad it was that way. He is our eyes into the team, like he says, he's just a guy with a bow and arrow. I'm really glad they decided to flesh out his character, and coupled with the reveal that she can't have kids, it's really nice to see Natasha and Barton's kids so close.\n\nFinally, the mid-credits scene was glorious, I really can't wait to see Thanos in action against the full team (plus the Guardians). So mental to think that it's three years and six movies away, as always I still can't believe this all spawned from an Iron Man film.

It honestly felt like it could have just as easily been Avengers 1 which is not a great thing for a sequel to be as it wasn't really showing any progression. I personally really would have wanted this to be like the Empire Strikes Back of the Avengers. Something to put them at an all time low. And some of the plot points in the film would have worked for that idea. Stark creating a monster that almost killed everyone, Hulk nearly destroying a city... If elements like those in the film could have seemed to have more consequence it could have really given some depth to the characters and the plot. I feel like at the end of the movie Stark should have had to deal with what he did and that the rest of the team shouldn't have just forgiven him. They could have used the animosity between them to build up to Civil War. But instead the movie ends feeling like nothing really happened. Everyone is still friends, everyone is still alive (at least everyone who was there at the beginning of the movie). Marvel can't just treat these movies like any normal series where they just make isolated Avenger films that don't change the landscape in a way that moves the series into a new phase. Avengers 1 was kinda simplistic and a little lacking in actual discernible plot, but at least it changed the dynamic of the MCU (as did Cap2). And that's why those movies matter in the series.\n\nI should say I'm not calling it an awful film. In fact on it's own it's probably as good as the first Avengers. Hawkeye is great in it and they really address the characters flaws and turn those elements around to make him probably the most likeable member of the group. The Black Widow-Hulk romance works although it might have worked better as an established element in the film. The action is a little hectic and cartoonish but it's still hella entertaining. The Vision looked great and although I did complain about the film feeling inconsequential, I did like the new, rag tag Avengers that we get by the end of the film.", "Read all these reviews, went in with low expectations, thought it would be a disaster, but wow, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWorst accusation I could level against it is that it doesn't change your life; it's not a movie that stays with you and with the first Avengers already in place, the novelty of \"all these heroes together finally united wow\" is pretty much worn off but still, a pretty great film.\n\nBetter than the first, more storylines, a darker tone, great action scenes, but what it really deserves plaudits for is the characterizations. If you've ever read Whedon's Astonishing X-Men, one of the best things about it is how he handles an ensemble cast; he gives them all goals, gives them all flaws, gives them all a unique voice, relegates Wolverine (the constant star of the series) to a bit part, and lets everyone shine. That's a remarkable feat in a 25 issue series, I don't even know what superlative to attach to doing that in a two hour film. With the sole exception of Thor, pretty much all the original Avengers get their say in the film and none of them (barring Thor), seems like they were relegated to a \"just here to round up the numbers\" part. What's more they don't fall into the Marvel trap of a lacklustre villain, Ultron was well and truly fleshed out and interesting. His confusion over the world seeping in here and there was a great touch, as well as the brilliant parralel pointed out by Scarlet Witch between him and Tony Stark. \n\nI thought the fighting hordes of faceless villains trope from the first movie would be repeated here again but again to my surprise, they managed to bring in a fresh approach with trying to save the city's residents. And NO FLYING CRASHING FALLING SPACESHIP!! Finally!\n\nI mean there was that city, but I'mma let em off on this one. All in all 7-8/10. Entertaining, action packed, had great touches of humanity; it's only sin was that at the end of the day, it was just another film and not the dawn of a new saviour. Go in expecting to be entertained, you'll be entertained.", "So disappointed the Star Wars teaser wasn't attached to my screening! ", "No one going to talking about Ultron singing his little robotic heart out?", "Overall I think I liked the movie. Lots of fantastic action, the action at Strucker's base was great, the action in Wakanda was ridiculous (THAT FUCKING HULKBUSTER FIGHT MADE ME MOIST), the action in Seoul was great and the action at the final battle was pretty damn cool too. The twins were great too.\n\nBut man there were a couple things that bugged me about this film. The biggest thing was just how boring Ultron was to me. I expected the absolutely menacing Ultron from the trailer and he was nowhere to be found in this film. What we got instead felt like a typical villain of the week who was pretty much evil for the sake of being evil. I didn't really like the whole \"He's like Stark!\" thing they had going with Ultron and watching Ultron deliver cheesy jokes just made me wish that he was Loki instead.  \n\nI really fucking enjoyed The Vision. His introduction was great but it made me a little sad to see his role ultimately reduced to an internet firewall vs Ultron. They really nailed the character though.\n\nSome plot points that confused me:\n\n* How did Ultron get Stark's personality in the first place? I thought his code was taken from the scepter?\n\n* Why did Ultron just ignore the fact that Jarvis was blocking his attempts to get nuclear weapons? \n\n* Why the fuck did we waste time following Thor to the pool of visions if we weren't gonna get to see his vision?\n\n* OUT OF ALL THE WAYS HE COULD DESTROY THE WORLD WHY DID HE DECIDE TO THROW A ROCK AT IT? Seriously this is a robot with access to shit like 4chan and a bunch of other sick shit that you can find onlline. That's the best thing you could come up with? A big rock?\n\n* Why did Ultron just leave Black Widow behind? Didn't he want to destroy the avengers?\n\nIn the end I quite liked the movie though. Just disappointed with how they handled Ultron and how easily he was defeated in the end. The twins felt like a bigger challenge for the team than Ultron.\n\nedit: I found the mid credits scene to be pretty disappointing. Like is it supposed to be a surprise that Thanos gets the gauntlet?

Had NO idea Idris Elba was gonna rock up so I was pleased. \n\nDug Vision's look, kinda bummed we didn't get more of him. Glad him and Ultron got to have a face to face. Absolutely LOVED how Vision proved his 'worthiness'. The audience did a little gasp there.\n\nThey were not kidding when they said that Hawkeye gets the best line in the movie. He's actually one of the only characters to get actual development, other than Black Widow and Hulk (sort of). Guess that's because he doesn't get his own film. I felt like this will be Hawkeye and Black Widow's last appearance in an Avengers film (outside of Civil War), there's just way too many people and I feel Hawkeye's arc was good enough to warrant a sendoff.\n\nX-Men Quicksilver was way better but I guess that's why Joss killed this version off. I thought Elizabeth Olsen did ok, but she looked spectacular. Have no idea why she looked so hot.\n\nUltron was ok. He flip flopped between menacing evil and wisecracking AI. It felt kinda off. The 'final battle' sequence was also rubbish. I preferred the evacuation sequence much more. Overall the best action scene is the beginning on Strucker's fort.\n\nHulk/Black Widow romance felt really forced.\n\nSo how useless was Thor's little side mission? And he just flew in randomly later.\n\nNick Fury was a spectacular failure. He literally pulls the Deus Ex Machina out of his ass. It would've been nice to have a scene showing us WHAT he's been doing since Captain America 2.\n\nThe film builds on a supposed fracture between Stark and Rogers but in the end they walk away as friends again. A real shame since Civil War basically has to build up the antagonistic relationship from scratch.\n\nSo yeah, Age of Ultron is a good fun time at the cinemas. Don't expect a gamechanger. Felt like Whedon phoned it in a little. I thought GotG and Captain America 2 were much better, but I'm just a killjoy I suppose.", "Some Notes:\n\n\u25cf Man, that opening.

Ultron jumps quickly from an AI to a fully functional robot, which serves the plot just right. Maybe what I'm saying is that I was expecting Ultron to have some build-up.\n\n\u25cf Vision is fantastic. Nuff said.\n\n\u25cf I love Hawkeye in this film. Love the Natasha BFF revelation, as everyone expects them to be lovers.\n\n\u25cf Love the hallucinations. Especially on Stark.\n\n\u25cf So Ultrons consciousness is just uploaded on the robots?

That set-up where his hand got severed is a pretty nice wink to us fans.\n\nI honestly have more, but I can't think off the top of my head because I'm still hung over on how good it is. Not a perfect film, but for me, still lives up to its hype. 9/10! ", "I like how in this discussion different opinions are being upvoted, instead of just the positive stuff. Hell, most of the comments aren't even quotes.

It would have been better if he were an established unit that aided The Avengers and over time, such as when the film begins, realized they were the problem more so than the enemies they combated. This would have made it less annoying that in the grand scheme of things Stark really didn't get as much hate as he should have for creating Ultron. Because Ultron would have been great for a period of time before going rogue. It all happens too quickly in this movie. He springs to life and immediately goes off on his plan to evolve the human race and rid the world of the majority of humans and The Avengers. \n\n2) There wasn't as much drama as I had hoped for given the tone of earlier trailers. Honestly, this whole movie felt like going through the motions and just getting it out of the way. It all goes by so quickly. Klaw was gone no sooner than he had appeared. I wish Wakanda had been the focus of the third act. Then they could have teamed up with the people of Wakanda and their tech to fight off Ultron's waves. Even more focus on team work and trust with a mysterious foreign nation and a certain Prince defending their land from Ultron alongside the Avengers, who would rather evacuate the citizens. That's wishful thinking, partly me hyping myself up too much because I was convinced they wouldn't give away everything in the trailers, but honestly, outside of Vision they basically did give everything away. \n\nThere were moments I felt cheated, like when the car fell from the bridge but Thor grabbed it. I want to see him fail, to feel that emotional punch. Instead we get a one liner and everyone's safe. On that same note, hundreds should have died during that Hulk/Iron Man fight. From the action we saw on screen, there's no way there weren't casualties, even if we saw Iron Man grab an elevator full of people or stop one cop from getting killed. Then they move on like nothing happened outside of Banner being guilty and a mention of the authorities possibly putting a warrant out for him in the future. Then we get the big choice later in the film with the citizens on the floating city or the whole of Earth but we don't get to take in the weight of it and how heavy it is on Cap and the rest of the team because two seconds after the choice is presented the helicarrier shows up. \n\nWhy the hell did this keep getting compared to Empire Strikes Back? Didn't Whedon himself claim this to be a big game changer with a darker ending? Was it just misdirection, making people think Ultron would get a win of sorts so they'd be surprised when of course he's defeated and no one dies? (outside of Quicksilver, who is surely going to return). \n\n\n3) A minor nuisance but with Whedon at the helm you'd think they would have had some flirtatious banter with Vision and Scarlet Witch. I'd have preferred seeing them hit it off than all the focus on Banner and Natasha. Also, Hulk didn't speak at all in this movie. What gives Whedon? He's normally on point with the banter and dialogue in general feeling lifted from the comics. Granted, there was still plenty of great dialogue in this. \n\n4) I wanted more from the Twins. They were kind of just there. They were at the hydra base. They met up with Ultron. They briefly scrapped with Cap and Thor, I think the extent of the whole scene was just Pietro punching Cap once. Then they turn on Ultron and join The Avengers. I never really felt attached to them, they were just these siblings that happened to be present for some events. \n\n5) The whole Shield/Fury thing wasn't dwelled on much. It doesn't seem to have had a big impact on things. It's just not there anymore and no one seems to care much when Fury shows up at the farm. I guess the Agents of SHIELD show will feature the Fury/SHIELD aspect of the film more in depth in the coming weeks. I hope. I wish we could have seen Falcon during the final battle. Weird that Fury recruits War Machine. \n\n6) Ultron needed some more substance. There wasn't much meat to him. His goals were kind of cliche and he didn't really seem to have a very good motive behind them. Just \"Avengers suck. People suck. I will evolve, it will be cool guys, trust me\". There was the how but not the why.  \n\n7) I think that's all of my nitpick complaints. I think overall I prefer this one to the first film, of which I nitpicked to death. So while I am critical, do note that I enjoyed the experience of watching the film.", "Not gonna lie, I was a bit disappointed. I thought it was great right up until Ultron was created, which is funny since he was one of my favourite parts of the movie. I just think the way the plot went was not what I wanted personally.\n\nIn the end, it felt like a filler Avengers to me. Civil War genuinely feels like a bigger and better movie, and this was just a set up to that like say Iron Man 2 was for the MCU. Absolute shame, since Ultron should rightfully be feared.\n\nI feel the Black Widow and Bruce Banner bullshit just needed to go. There was just no need to add that in, and I feel it just added too much pointless screen time. I feel the friendship between Steve and Natasha in The Winter Soldier worked well because it showed how they had missions together and so obviously got a bond between them, but with Mark Ruffalo I just saw no reason whether it be looks or personality why there'd even be an attraction. I just feel it was forced, and whilst the scenes of her trying to bring back Banner and get rid of the Hulk were good, I feel that is how we should have seen something start, instead of an outright attraction happening off screen prior to the film, since it just causes a convoluted set of events when we could have the luxury of seeing it develop on screen ourselves.\n\nI was also not happy with the end Ultron got. Just like shitty little Loki the way the villain is defeated is another \"haha look how shitty and comical this villain can be stopped\". Compare this to The Dark Knight. The Joker is caught yet his presence is still felt and ultimately the impact he made will stay. I'm actually really disappointed Ultron didn't just straight up be the reason for a Registration Act. And it could have been, had the story not been focused around this pointless town. I just didn't care for it at all. It just didn't need to be there for that long. I will admit though I was happy with Ultron's overall plan for destroying mankind because it made complete sense and I was pleased with how quick and easy it came across, and it's nice having a villain want to get straight on with shit rather than linger his plan.\n\nI enjoyed the film don't get me wrong. I just came away feeling like it was missing something. It just didn't feel like a complete film, and definitely not the big grand epic finale to the Phases that we would have expected. \n\nAh well. James Spader was a fantastic villain and his character was surprisingly humorous/camp and I loved how blunt he was about monologue-ing cliches. Hawkeye has finally found his place in the side and it's a great one. I had my own issues with Vision because I really wanted him to be straight up Jarvis (it feels like Jarvis is dead now sigh), but he was a good character nonetheless. \n\nOverall, disappointed. A solid entry to the MCU, but I just think it could have been so much more, especially with a few plot changes that make it flow better. Whilst the first film had an issue of being overly simplistic, this one just felt too messy and busy.

That would have been really awkward!", "To me Age of Ultron pretty much typifies the problems the series is going to have moving forward - 1) living up to the absolutely ridiculous Internet hype and 2) juggling all of these characters\n\nAoE is a fun film for sure, but it just lacks the novelty and freshness of the original film. The dialogue isn't as peppy and some of it was just straight up cheesy. I groaned when they mentioned Cap's dislike for bad language for like the fifth time.\n\nIt's a 7/10 film if the original is an 8/10 or a 9/10. The opening sequence is far better than the clumsy opening chase of The Avengers, but Ultron is a lacking substitute for Loki (Spader killed it,  but Whedon did him no favours), the second act isn't that great and a lot of the action has a \"been there, done that\" feel.\n\nI wasn't bored for a minute, though. It's enjoyable but there are at least 2 or 3 better films in the MCU.\n\nAlso, can anyone remember why the fuck Thor went in that cave with Selvig?", "*Hulk bounds off  the SHIELD Helicarrier and lands inside the flying Quinjet*\n\n\"Oh for gods sakes!\" *smash*", "Just saw it last night in Singapore, was brilliant overall\n\nGood:\n\n- Fight between Hulkbuster and Hulk was exhilarating\n- The 'birth' of Vision\n- Extra screen time for Hawkeye, War Machine, Falcon etc\n- Genuinely very funny at points\n- Ultron was a good villain\n\nBad\n- Hardly any development for Quicksilver; slightly more for Scarlet Witch.  Very disappointed Quicksilver died.\n- The comparisons were inevitable but the quicksilver in DoFP was much better\n- Movie moved perhaps a bit too fast at the cost of character development for all the new characters\n- Ultron's final move not as impactful as the Avenger's Earth invasion", "\"Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.\"", "I was honestly a bit disappointed with the movie as a whole. Dont get me wrong it was a fun movie, but even tough its 141 minutes long it felt ''short'', didnt it? \n\nIt just felt like the pace was too fast and things didnt settle in, everything just sort of ''happend'' with no bit of explanation or any build up to it. I think the characters motivations werent well showed.\n\nIn conclusion, my tought was: \n\nThings done right:\n\n- The action is just espectacular, even more when avengers fought as a team. The hulk x hulkbuster scene was great along with the first fight in the woods, in the beggining of the movie.\n\n- Ultron personality was fun to watch, some funny comic bits and scenes.\n\n- It was nice seeing captain more as a leader and kicking a lot more ass than in the first movie. I think its cool that you can really see him developing his skills through out the movies. \n\n- Hawkeye was really good in this movie, I liked that they showed he knows his place but still can make a huge difference in the team. I really liked his comic bits too, probably the funniest scenes in the movie have him involved.\n\n- The end scene with the ''New Avengers'' was pretty cool, that felt really right.\n\n- Vision was just spot on. Every single scene with him was just great!\n\n\nThings gone wrong:\n\n- The movie felt like it didnt add much to the storyline as a whole, I think that it should had focus more on explaining the power and importance of the infinity stones as a whole to the MCU, people that dont remember much of the previous movies or didnt watch them still have no clue/dont care what a infinity stone is. \n\n- For a movie called ''the AGE of Ultron'' it felt to me like Ultron was really easilly defeated and all the story in the movie felt like it happend way too fast. As I said before  things happened with no build up to it, they just ''happened''. I think the pacing in this movie in general wasnt so great, storywise.\n\n- I missed a more manecing and dark Ultron. He felt more like a spoiled child than a dark enemy, he just didnt ''scare'' me at all. I tought he was really gonna give a tough time to some of the avengers, I felt like in NO moment I was at the edge of my seat thinking ''Holy shit, he's gonna kill him/her (add any of the avengers). I just never tought any of the Avengers where actually IN DANGER anytime through the entire movie. I felt that sometimes with Loki in the first movie (first fight with Cap, killing Coulson, almost killing Thor and stabbing him bad, almost killing Tony at the tower, etc)\n\n- This bothered me so much: Tony puts the whole world in danger with his stupid ''I wanna be a mad scientist'' moment and by the end he has nothing to respond for? Even if no one actually acuse him of anything, he doesnt seem to care or take responsability for anything he did, by the end of the movie everyone is fine with what happend (even tough probably thousands of civilian lifes were taken) and the end felt like nothing really happened, that felt so cheesy and weird to me. It was the perfect situation to adress a struggle between Cap x Tony and maybe give a glimpse of what Civil War might feel and they just seem like best buds by the end of the movie. No one care about anything that happend!\n\n- The romance between Natasha and Banner was really forced and out of place. It just happened out of nowhere and Natasha who was introduced as a cold hearted spy is now acting like a sentimental teenager. It just didnt work for me, it was just weird.\n\n- Honestly Nick Fury has no place in this movie other than conveniently showing with a Hellicarrier by the end of it, one more example to me of things that just ''happen'' with no build up to it. I really like his character but it felt like he was just squeezed in this movie for the sake of it.\n\n- I really didnt like Thor in this movie, he had such a high place in the first Avengers and now he just felt to me like a secondary character in this movie, the character really lacked emotion. And what the hell was that scene with Selvig, what was that lake that gave him a ''vision'' of things, what were his visions? Why he needed Selvig for with him? One more thing that just ''happend''\n\n- So basically at the end of the movie it seems like Hawkeye and Ironman just dropped out of the Avengers? I think that was really unclear but it felt like they did. And if they did, shouldnt it feel like it was more of a big deal than what they showed? For me it just felt like ''So, Tony and Barton maybe are out, whatever, who cares''. It should be a big deal!\n\nWell these are my toughts, fun movie with great action, but the story and character emotions felt a little flat to me. 7 ou of 10.\n\nEdits: Formated the text a bit and added a few more point of views that I had forgotten to add", "Honestly I found it a little disappointing but I think that is due to more Marvel films to compare it to. There was always gonna be a harder job bringing the Avengers back together again plus a few more additions and since all deserve to have equal screen time the film doesn't flow too well. It was comicbook-y and that was great but the darker tone wasn't really necessary in my opinion", "A very satisfying movie in itself. Hits all the right and familiar beats. Had no doubt Whedon could craft something cohesive with so many players. What with this age of trailers revealing too much, spoilery industry news and online leaks, the film still has plenty of surprises left. Well, character wise, it was surprising at least. Yes, being the movie that it is, you know they come out on top. But its like a math equation you know the answer to but you\u2019d still like to see their work in how they got there.\n\nBut it could be a bit distracting for hardcore followers what with all the easter eggs, references to past movies, winks to the source material, and planting the seed for future movies. These turn into full on tangents that takes away momentum. Yes, I see how Thor\u2019s little dream quest side story sets up his future solo films, but it kinda did nothing for the main movie. \n\nMy only other gripe beyond that is Ultron\u2019s lips. Kinda off putting. Thats some Bayformer\u2019s Optimus Prime stuff right there. \n\nSPOILERY POST MOVIE DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:\n\n(1) What made [AoU spoilers](#s \"The Vision worthy of Mjolnir?\")\n\n(2) Where is [AoU spoilers](#s \"the Hulk\") going?\n\n(3) [AoU spoilers](#s \"They brought back Coulson, can they bring back Pietro?\")\n\n(4) Y\u2019know. We saw the [AoU spoilers](#s \"Jocasta card\"). Why not that instead of Friday?", "I was really disappointed in the film. The story seems to follow this line of 'this happens, and then this happens, and then this happens' etc. A lot of story that happens with no real reason why it happens or how the characters knew to do it. All the wittiness fell flat and usually felt like it was coming in the wrong scenario.\n\nThis movie felt like it was made for the sole reason of introducing another infinity stone to be relevant in Avengers 3. Like another checklist on the Marvel catalogue to lead up to their bigger plan and it made the whole movie really inconsequential. There were no ramifications felt or even the sense that they would be. Everyone seemed to forgive Tony Stark's mad scientist moment after Vision was revealed. At no point did any Avengers member seem like they were in peril or any real state of distress so there was no edge of my seat or moment with a lot of tension. Also the fact that neither Stark or Banner had a single thought that this unknown AI could be dangerous/out of their control makes their renowned scientific minds void. They were dumb and the movie is about fixing a problem the Avengers made for themselves without ever addressing that fact.\n\nI couldn't stand the Hulk/Black Widow love story, it felt wasted and unnecessary and also made Black Widow seem less of a character than the first Avengers with only snippets of this idea of her tortured past appearing for a few minutes then ignored and never brought up again. So much dialogue from every character made me sigh at least once from how cheesy/pointless/dumb it was.\n\nThe movie suffered from having trailers that were better than the film. The moments in the trailer that showed the Avengers beaten like with Cap's shield broken were all done in the first 20min and basically all a hallucination. Even when the Avengers were saying \"we took a hit\" and they were broken it didn't seem like they should be, it didn't feel like they got beaten so badly that they were 'broken'. A lot of the great Ultron lines from the trailer were also altered into something worse, the 'you're all puppets on strings/there are no strings on me' didn't have nearly the same impact as well as his 'people look to the sky and see hope, I'll take that from them first' (The quotes are slightly off, just from memory); they removed the second part of that trailer quote and the actual movie line was bad in comparison.\n\nSpeaking of Ultron, that was the main part that excited me for the film. James Spader's voice, existential robot that wants to help bring peace by destroying everything. But it was never consistent. Ultron would randomly throw out a witty joke, or talk like a snarky person sometimes that didn't seem in line with the character. At some point a character likens Ultron's way of thinking to Stark by saying 'where do you think he gets that from?' But there is no reason why Ultron should have an imprint of Stark. Unless his time as a formless AI solely recorded Stark and incorporated his traits? But ultimately the character felt as deep as a puddle with generic AI tropes thrown in. Which shouldn't be surprising since Marvel are terrible with writing good villains. And as usual the villain was destroyed at the end with no hope for coming back which seems like a waste of Ultron.\n\nThis is getting quite long so I'll stop.\n\nTl;dr Nothing in Avengers: Age of Ultron did anything for me. Will it make $1b? Most likely. Will it be critically praised? Probably.", "Did anyone else think ultron wasn't scary? Or even a good villain", "\"Hide the Zucchini\"...Yep, Whedon's seen the GIF folks! Hehehe", "Argh. Ultron (the villain) was so **disappointing**. \n\nAt first he was a software that got ahold of their HQ, right, complete with the Iron Legion. Okay, I thought, this was gonna be fun, the Avengers vs their own HQ. \n\nBut then Ultron broke through to the Internet (even though Stark himself can't copy it to *his* mainframe and that's why they had to do it while the scepter is there), and he became more powerful. Okay, I thought, it's the Avengers vs the whole US Armed Forces (or at least the computerized parts of it). \n\nAnd then Ultron obtained the Vibranium. Oh shit, I thought, the Ultron legion is gonna be unbeatable! I wonder how they're going to win this. \n\nBuuuut. \n\nWhat did Ultron do? He created. A lame ass doomsday device. What is this, the 90s? What kind of villain does doomsday devices these days? It's basically putting all your eggs in one basket. And what unnecessary basket it was, because with a legion of robots made of Vibranium how would you even have difficulty destroying the world? \n\nWhat could've happened instead? \n\n- The movie would have more action while keeping the same \"save the humans\" theme. \n\n- He stays true(ish) to Stark's idea of keeping a robot police state. \n\n- Quicksilver and the SW would have more of a role than just two more people hitting stuff and tearing them apart: Quicksilver becomes the **only** person capable of killing the Vibranium robots (because he's the only person who can reliably enough reach into the necks and pull out their cables or something), and Scarlet Witch can play with the Ultron's mind which can somehow help the Avengers defeat him. Having two exciting new characters.... Just to smack robots around? Boring. (Also, Hawkeye and Widow can prove to be as useful as their super-powered comrades here because they have finesse and can help with slitting throats. The Cap and Thor and Stark can't do anything with their blunt force abilities, against the Vibranium armor.) \n\n- Ultron either would escape physically (as a formidable robot in its own right) or escape as software (without the Vision being the deus ex machine that solved that huge problem in 8 frigging seconds). This would afaik stay truer to the comics. \n\n- The fight could probably spread throughout the world instead of being localized in an unknown (and fictitious) country, giving the impression of a higher stake. \n\nThe doomsday device really took all the suspense away. We know how movies with doomsday devices end. All the eggs are in one basket after all. There's no suspense. \n", "It was exactly what I expected it to be: pretty much Avengers: Same as the First One. Was it entertaining? Yes. Did it feel fresh? No.\nIt had plenty of banter and character moments, but the plot is extremely straight forward and simple. The abundance of characters sort of hindered the build up of the story. And the whole thing feels more like just an episode in the overall \"marvel cinematic TV show.\" Connecting previous movies with the upcoming ones.\nThere were simply too many important people in the movie. So the whole film felt like it was rationing out scenes. To be fair, I think Joss Whedon did a great job with what he was dealt. But I can't help but feel that this movie could have been much better if it had half of its current main cast.\nThe performances, on the other hand were pretty much all great. Especially James Spader and Andy Serkis(despite only being on screen for a few minutes.) The only thing I wasn't quite sure about were the Twins' accents.\nThere you have it, my thoughts on Age of Ultron.\nI haven't typed so much English since high school, so pardon any grammar mistakes.\n", "Not sure who's gonna see this, but during the Thor vs Iron Man fight scene we were hit with a quake (Northern India region, around 7:30 UTC I think) and for a minute it felt like a part of the movie...then it hit the people in the theater, oh shit everything's actually shaking", "Am I the only one who hoped against hope at that last scene we'd see Quicksilver dash in?\n\nNo.\n\nOkay ._.", "Not sure if somebody has already said this, but after the end of movie clips (with Thanos) we waited to see if there would be an after credits cameo or anything and it turned out there wasn't one (we were expecting a scene with them eating like the last avengers) kind of a disappointment, but pretty pleased overall with the movie. ", "Quicksilver in Days of Future Past moves bullets out of harms way and in this he catches them with his torso...", "I have very mixed feelings about it. It felt like it attempted to take far too much on, like it jumped from location to location far to quickly and if anything there was too much action. There was obviously a lot of cut material from it that would have helped flesh the story out, and it kind of ended up giving the impression that the story was just a vehicle to segue between different action sequences. The Hulk vs Hulkbuster fight for example, really served no purpose to the story, and it's something I would have probably sacrificed for expanding the set up for the final battle or the creation of Vision.\n\nThe really frustrating thing is that I think there's a really good film there somewhere, using the footage they've shot (and probably cut) from the film. The dialogue is on point, and I really enjoyed the Banner/Widow storyline, and it's probably funnier than the first Avengers film. However, I'm still not really sure how I feel about this incarnation of Ultron. I understand the desire to not make him like every other humanity hating AI, but the way he jokes and muses made him border on being campy at times. \n\nIt was still enjoyable, but it did feel like kind of a let down. The scope is bigger but it ended up coming across like a film made with the specific remit of hitting certain fan service action beats, rather than telling a story.", "My thoughts on the movie\n\n- Could have utilized Ultron more, he just appears all of a sudden, no mystery to the villain, James Spader's voice was fucking hypnotic though\n\n- HAWKEYE !!! Yay!!!!\n\n- Hulk and Black Widow just don't fit\n\n- Iron Man's Ego and the Avengers: Age of Ultron\n\n- Vision looked dope as fuck\n\n- Avenger's never felt like they were in any danger..... Doesn't create tension on the viewer's part\n\n- The pace of the movie was horrible.... Action. No action. Action. No action. Action. Let the interactions build into something\n\n- Wanda and Pietro's accent tend to dissapear mid-speech\n", "i was pretty let down by this one. Ultron just fell really flat,the hero's were never in even the least bit of danger, i mean ultron hit cap dead in the chest with his ray a few times and it didn't even stun him, and thats cap, nvm thor, hulk or iron man. \n\n\ni think they would have been better off allowing ultron to reach his \"final form\" freiza style, and have the avengers face off against that, rather than an army of mook robots, that weren't even a threat to the weakest of the avengers.", "Lots of good concepts and moments lost in a somewhat incoherent film. It's not awful by any means but it's all over the shop. \nBruce and Tony as mad scientists together was great, Hawkeye was great, the twins were great, Cap is always great, Ultron had his moments, I really liked Vision but he was under used. Generally there's no cohesion. Characters appear and disappear with no explanation, plot points are brought up and then glossed over. The whole Clint's farm + family thing was odd (though not awful), I didn't mind the Widow and Bruce storyline but it maybe could have had a bit more of a build up because the last time you saw them together he nearly killed her and she seemed to be terrified of him.\n\nI suppose they had a tough job to do transitioning from a generally upbeat 'super friends save the world together' universe to a 'conflict within the group and cataclysmic events that they may not be able to stop' universe that the MCU is morphing in to. \n\nThere's a high standard to live up to though with the Marvel films so the fact that this didn't meet my expectations doesn't mean I didn't like it, I'd see it again in a heartbeat.", "At the end of the film they discuss the worthiness of an elevator that lifts the hammer. But an elevator would never use the power of the hammer for misdeeds or injustice, in that sense the elevator is definitely worthy. \n\n(I posted this as a reply to a comment but i thought id post it again.) ", "Everyone's saying they loved him, but Vision was the straw that broke this movie for me. Indicative of the huge problem that Marvel is causing for itself: way, way too many characters to do any of them justice. Breathless and nonsensical plots. Sacrificing interesting drama to service the needs of upcoming films and tie up threads from old ones.\n\nI speak as a layperson. I have never read a marvel comic. Please don't reply telling me I don't get it because I haven't read the comics. I know. I *know* I don't get it. I'm not going to read the comics. I have no interest in doing that. Movies exist on their own, as separate entities, and this Great Marvel Tie In Experiement is a really unique construction. One that's starting to strain and crack under its own weight.\n\nHere's what I think Age of Ultron wanted to do: I think it wanted to have Tony Stark, hands down the most interesting and personable of all the Avengers, create a flawed and exaggerated mirror of himself that he then has to defeat, confronting all the while the fact that he is composed of the ability to create and destroy in equal measure. That's a tidy movie.\n\nHere's what it actually did: Tony Stark and Bruce Banner accidentally create a super-evil robot who, in truth, is the flip side of an artifical intelligence created by tony stark that is then born into a physical body with an infinity stone on its head, but it doesn't matter anyway because Ultron ultimately makes his fatal mistake by killing a side character and angering the side character's sister. Along the way a *ton* of side characters appear and disappear, then everyone goes home. \n\nThat...is a mess.\n\nFor a movie to work, you need stakes. The Avengers trades off the idea that the stakes are THE FATE OF THE WORLD, and sure, that counts as stakes. But you also need personal stakes. You need to have a battle for the world *and* the battle for someone's soul, and that last part is what was missing here.\n\nUltron could *really* have worked if he was Stark's creation, and Stark's responsibility to clean up. Instead, Stark turns around and hands that responsibility--and the battle for his soul--off on to Vision, who in turn promptly does nothing for the rest of the movie. He's not even a proxy for Stark's guilt at creating a world-destroying AI. He literally turns up, says 'hey lets fight Ultron', then helps fight Ultron. Doesn't even do anything particularly interesting during the fight. Just exists there to fill out the frame. \n\nIt gets worse, because in the end Ultron is killed by Scarlett Witch after he makes the fatal mistake of killing her brother. That's a massive non sequitur, narrative-wise. Stark opts to heroically prevent a comet from destroying Earth instead, which isn't his fight. Stark's fight is with his flawed creation. That confrontation never happens, and so the entire movie feels unfinished. (Side note: The tacked on scene between Vision and the last vestige of Ultron doesn't count. Ultron's death scene is when Scarlett Witch rips his heart out).\n\nVision should not have been in this movie. Contributed nothing and diluted the only interesting dynamic that the film seemed to *desperately* want to explore. The movie has too many characters and too many responsibilities outside of itself. Fuck infinity stones and Vision and the set up for a civil war or whatever--make *this* movie interesting and everyone's better off. But you can't do that, because this is the Marvel experiment, and the Marvel experiment has obligations that require this quota of characters to be introduced in the film so they may exist in the next one.\n\nAnd I know, I know. I don't get it because I haven't read the comics. As a movie, and nothing but a movie, Age of Ultron has a ton of problems.\n\n**ALL** that said: I still enjoyed it. Joss Whedon can pull off effortless witty banter, and that helps.", "Watched it yesterday. It was alright. 3/5 for me.\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n* Ultron was a big joke. I like Spader's voice, but the dialogue was so wrong. Such a waste to make him crack jokes and quips all the time. Make him menacing and serious. He would be so much more of a threat and more intimidating. He's basically a Disney villain. (Maybe I should've expected that...)\n* Am I the only one that thought Vision looked ridiculous. I couldn't take it seriously. The makeup and prosthetics didn't work for me at all. The golden cape looked like some shitty cosplay.\n* Music was wholly unremarkable.\n* Iron Man beating the Hulk? Bullshit. \n* Mid-credit scene was stupid. Oh, here's Thanos and he'll be beaten and quipped about in the next film. \n* Vision wielding Mjolnir was a huge mistake. Should've saved that moment for Cap and Thanos. Now it won't have the same impact. \n* Some CGI was really rough (bad) looking. That scene where Black Widow is riding the Hulk's back... omg.. so bad.\n\nEdit: Iron Man did not really beat the Hulk now that I think of it. He just waited until Hulk got out of Scarlet Witch's spell. \n\n", "I just want to thank everyone who saw the movie some days ago and said it wouldn't live up to the hype.\n\nBecause it fucking did, you lowered my expectations and I ended up loving every minute of it.\n\n\nI don't recommend 3D, though.

They have a nice personality, their powers looks cool and the little feud between Clint and Quicksilver is cute. I wonder if what happens to Quicksilver was planned since the beginning or if his inclusion to X-men pushed Whedon to kill him. Anyway I was a bit disappointed to not see a memorial, or even just Wanda putting a flower down or something at the end.\n\nI'm glad we got to see a bit of Natasha's past (even if Agent Carter already gave us a glimpse of the Black Widow's program) and her romance with Banner was unexpected but nice.

When did Tony find Jarvis again, and how was he just magically okay? Some subplots needed to be dropped, and some finished. I think this was the risk in having scarlet witch screw with ALL of the Avengers - it created a lot of plot work.  \n\nUltron was a little inconsistent, too, and the way he was animated reminded me of Davy Jones from pirates of the Caribbean, which seemed off because, you know, metal. \n\nIt was a fun movie, I'm glad I saw it, but, somehow, you could feel that the production team didn't have their heart in this one the same way.

Here's why:\n\n- The action scenes were way too busy and the sheer amount of them hardly allowed for character development.\n\n- The character development that they did try to do felt very forced and some conversations were highly out of place. Case in point is when quicksilver starts talking about his past to Ultron.\n\n- The Bruce/Natasha storyline was unnecessary, out of place and not interesting.\n\n- Ultron is not convincing as a villain at all. For a self-learning AI system he makes some terribly stupid decisions. Why would he not pull a Voldemort and store pieces of himself in different systems or whatever?\n\n- Ultron goes from awake to 100% evil and fully developed character-wise in about 4 seconds. That relates back to the character development point earlier. Plus, Marvel movies just can't seem to get villainy right. At no point did I feel like this was a menacing adversary.\n\n- Vision pops out of that box and not a minute later he's a fully developed character that's accepted by everyone as part of the avengers.\n\nThat's about it for now because m writing this on my phone and it's getting too long.\n\nEdit: autocorrect ", "Anyone else think the special effects in the opening sequence were really bad? I was getting worried but then the rest of the film was completely fine. I don't get it.", "Late to the party (Why did you upload this in the middle of the night European time?) but here's some Initial thoughts:\n\n* ~~I still have no clue why they gave Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch heavy slavic accents, but it wasn\u2019t half as annoying as I expected.~~ Edit: I guess it's canon for the twins to have accents, I had no idea. ATJ really sold himself as an actor, I thought, especially after everybody complained about his wooden performance in Godzilla.\n\n* Wow, not only did War Machine survive the whole thing, he had some pretty good moments throughout.\n\n* Stan Lee\u2019s cameo was dumb as hell but I laughed so hard.\n\n* I thought this was the funniest MCU movie, maybe tied with Guardians. I much prefer Whedon\u2019s style of quick witty style as opposed to, say, Shane Black, who seemed to constantly have to halt his action in Iron Man 3 to deliver an intentionally funny moment.\n\n* They really committed to the Black Widow/Hulk love story, which I was surprisingly okay with.\n\n* I\u2019ve heard critics complaining that it spends too much time setting up future MCU movies, I didn\u2019t really get that at all. The Civil War tie-ins felt natural and the trip to Wakanda(?) was entertaining enough. It took me until afterwards to realize they were setting up Thor 3, and I didn\u2019t catch any references to Dr. Strange, Ant-Man, or Captain Marvel.\n\n* I had a feeling they were gonna go out of their way to make Hawkeye more likeable and god damn did they do a good job. I thought he had the funniest moments in the whole movie.\n\n* Speaking of Hawkeye, Joss Whedon is one cheeky bastard. I was POSITIVE Clint was going to die throughout the whole movie, and I don\u2019t think I was alone. Family man? Check. Pregnant wife to leave behind? Check. Funny nice guy just trying to do the right thing? Check. Running back to selflessly save someone in the middle of the climax? Bitch please. At first I thought Quicksilver\u2019s death seemed super rushed (no pun intended) but I think Whedon knew exactly what he was doing in that scene\n\n* I think my biggest gripe was the portrayal of Ultron. He was more charismatic than most MCU villains, which is good and all but considering he\u2019s a robot it felt out of place. He kept talking about evolution, but he didn\u2019t really evolve much over the film; He started as data, then possessed a beat-up Stark drone, then within 10 minutes had the body that we saw from the trailers. I know he got slightly bigger and bigger as the movie went on but I thought it would be interesting if he started out as an incredibly simple, robotic-sounding AI at the beginning and morphed over the course of the film into something more advanced and humanoid, but by the end of the first act he already had an expressive face and a barely-modulated James Spader voice. Additionally, he wasn't ever really *scary.* Sure, he acted menacing at times, but as a singular unit he wasn\u2019t terribly powerful and he spent too much time making quirky Iron Man-esque jokes. I suppose they were trying to highlight that he\u2019s Tony\u2019s doppleganger, but I wanted him to be more of a soulless terminator hell bent on annihilating Earth. Even Loki, the \u201ctrickster,\u201d tortured people and gave intimidating monologues. \n\n* Vision wielding Thor\u2019s Hammer? I have no idea whether that has a precedent in the comics, but god damn was it satisfying. Especially since everybody was convinced it would be Cap.\n\n* Speaking of the hammer, I love how they addressed its wonky physics. \n\n* Surprised we didn\u2019t even get a Loki cameo\n\n* This has nothing to do with the film itself, but I saw the movie in France. Everybody in my theater gasped in amazement when they saw Tony\u2019s self-driving car at the end. I thought that was cute.\n\n* The friends I went with complained that they hated the new Avengers lineup (Cap, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, Vision) but I actually really like it, because it implies we\u2019ll see much more of all of those characters for a little while longer (I was scared Vision/Wanda/Rhodie would be dead by the ending). Plus it\u2019s not like Iron Man and Thor are gone, Stark is essentially the new Director of SHIELD (I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he takes on a title like that in the future) and Thor still has another solo movie. \n\n* Bit disappointed by the ending, just because it wrapped up too neatly. I suppose there\u2019s always Civil War to cause some real unrest, though.\n \n* The end(mid?) credits scene was cool I guess, a little disappointing considering it doesn\u2019t tell us anything we don\u2019t already know. Not that I mind more Thanos being badass, but the kind of people who stick around till after the credits *know* that he\u2019s coming soon. Seemed like a waste of an opportunity to tease any of their new A-list Avengers getting films in the coming years.\n\n* I continue to be blown away by Whedon\u2019s ability to juggle all these characters and make it seem like an ensemble cast. Avengers 1 had 8 main characters, counting Loki and Nick Fury, and it still seemed like the Iron Man show at times. This one has 12 Avengers, one major villain, two minor villains, and a more large-scale plot, and still manages to give every single character an awesome moment or two.\n\nOverall I give the movie a 9/10, which is what I gave the first one. It\u2019s essentially just what we saw in The Avengers again, but (in my opinion) done slightly better. Yeah it loses that \u201cwow\u201d factor of seeing all the characters on screen together for the first time, but I thought the action was cooler, the writing was tighter, and the movie as a whole felt more well-paced.", "\"Age of Ultron\" last 2 days.

But it was completely insignificant.\n\nThe whole out of nowhere Banner-Widow love story was ridiculous also. Where did that come from? \n\nThe first Avengers really impressed me with some of the action scenes this one not so much, seen them all in the trailers anyway.", "Those epic team shots, at the start in the snow and at the end in the circle... Just amazing! Really disappointed Quicksilver died, really enjoyed the twins and I was impressed by Elizabeth Olsen's performance, accents were ok but kinda cringey. Had to have a laugh at the B-Team roll out at the end, Falcon as an Avenger, really? \n\nAs much as I want the rumours to be true about Hulk in GoTG2, didn't look like he left Earth. Mid credits scene was great. Vision's intro and character was just perfect and the Avengers dynamic was great.\n\nRDJ was lookin' old in this one I thought. All in all this was the perfect sequel to The Avengers and I will most likely see it again in cinemas once the rush dies down. One thing I didn't like was how War Machine wasn't present in the epic team shot in the last big battle. \n\nAlso no Agents of Shield characters at all? I keep watching that show but the producers really need to give something back, an Avenger in the show or agents in the movies, no reason Coulson's team shouldn't have been on that heli-carrier. Gonna live in hope that the tie in episode is ok, not like the Thor Dark World tie in episode which was terrible, and the Winter Solider tie in which was very rushed.\n\nNot sure how I felt about Hawkeye's family, I don't think they were really needed for the movie, just took up screen time. Felt certain they were just giving Hawkeye all this character development to kill him off, but quicksilver got the knock off instead.\n\nLoved it, solid 8.5 out 10.

If you wanted something different, some change to the Marvel formula, you'll be disappointed. Age of Ultron is pretty much the same movie as the first one. Especially the ending which feels like it follows the first movie beat by beat.\n\nThere are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. But good moments don't make a good movie. What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie.\n\nTony Stark retired in Iron Man 3 and now he's suddenly back? They don't even try to explain his return. Tony Stark also creates Ultron, the main bad guy of the movie who goes to cause some major mayhem. The movie just glosses over the fact that everything is Stark's fault. Aside Hawkeye there isn't any character development. These movies always just seem to be about \"setting something up\" for the future movies and I think I finally figured it. The only thing they're setting up is more characters running around, bigger CGI punching bigger CGI and bigger thing falling from the sky. In the middle of all this it's just so hard to care about anything. All those previous movies build to this?\n\nAge of Ultron seems to just be in a hurry and jump over the story and get to the CGI punching CGI and oh boy there's plenty of that. The Avengers fight an army of generic, faceless and harmless CGI robots for 2 hours, roll credits. I just didn't care. There's no stakes in the action. When the characters are just joking around I'm not worried if they'll make it till the next movie.\n\nMarvel should have gotten serious in Age of Ultron. You can be serious without being all \"dark and gritty\" too. Joss Whedon said he was influenced by Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2. Joss Whedon promised we'd see some superhero blood. Joss Whedon failed.", "Did anyone else feel like Thor's water-based vision quest had been maaaajorly edited down? Such a shame. We wait three(!) years for these films, and fair enough as it takes that amount of time to make 'em good - but considering the wait, why not give us a three hour film? Every moment spent with these characters is incredible, whether you like it or not - the simple fact that we HAVE these films is amazing. ", "I am going to be 100% honest, this was one of my least favourite Marvel films. Ultron was just a stereotypical 'I want to destroy humanity' villain that had nothing unique to him apart from being a robot created by Tony. And the interaction between Tony and Ultron was almost non-existent, which was a missed opportunity for a big, spectacular fight between them. The reaction that Ultron had of being compared to Tony by Klaw was fierce, and Vision said himself that Ultron hated Tony the most, but apart from that you simply wouldn't know that.\n\nThe romance subplot between Widow and Banner came out of nowhere, and frankly was somewhat unnecessary. There was little indication from Avengers 1 that they had that type of attraction with each other. If they actually worked up towards that point during the movie with proper interactions instead of Widow basically saying 'I want the D' during the party scene, I would have been fine with it, but it just seemed so rushed right from the beginning.\n\nI won't comment too much on Thor looking into his dreams since I haven't seen Thor 2, but that whole scenario just seemed weird. I know if I saw Thor 2 it would have made more sense, but it was one of the least successful Marvel movies commercially, so I know many other people would of been lost by it as well. Apart of the single frame close-up of Vision, where in that dream did Thor get 'that robot is the key to defeating Ultron'?\n\nI wish Vision was a more complex character than what he became. It should of had more questions about its existence like Ultron, but come to a different conclusion. Instead he's just a goodly-two-shoes as soon as it is introduced, to the level where it can pick up Mjolnir for no discernible reason.\n\nI have other problems with Age of Ultron, but those are my biggest ones. The writing just felt far more sloppy than what we had with Avengers 1, Cap 2, Guardians and even with Daredevil. The special effects are great, the fight scenes were great and the Hulkbuster was amazing, and that alone makes it worth going to see for any comic fan. But the story simply isn't up to par with the other Marvel films.", "Thought it was great but I must say, I thought there was a few too many jokes in there ", "Got to say, this film did nothing for me. From that absolutely horrible opening shot that had exceptionally poor CGI (it looked a lot worse than the same style of shot in the first film) to the climax of just a lot of poor CGI.

They dont show his funeral, so there may be another movie for him.\n\nUltron probably is the most interesting villain for Iron Man. I feel he overdoes his joke at times it doesnt feel right. What is his ultimate power here? The ability to produce tons of drones? Because he sure is weak when it comes to real duel. For the movie called AGE of Ultron, he cant even last a couple of weeks.\n\nThe action sequences feel more cinematic than the first one. Really love the opening tracking scene, when everything is still fresh, the third act feels long and tiring.\n\nNat and Bruce relationship gives some colours for the story although its all so sudden.

(also at the beginning of the skype conversation Laura did mention that they wouldn't like to come live where she lives, so they could be tortured in what ever afterlife that Laura was typing about) So it makes sense that she died. To me letting her live would have ruined it. She would still be alive, yes she witnessed her \"loved ones\" getting killed, but she would have gotten away with what she did to Laura. Now it would have been cool if instead of showing the ghost, they did kill her off like the others. Still way better then I thought it was going to be.

They didn't shut up the whole movie and one of the kids that was there spoiled the stupid movie.

It wouldn't have changed the story much if they had taken it out. I saw this at SXSW, and Gosling did a panel with Guillermo Del Toro the day before. They were talking about the movie as if the genre was \"fairytale\". Perhaps there was some traditional fairytale archetypes that I didn't recognize and didn't get what the story was trying to say. \n\nI've never seen Matt Smith in Dr. Who, but I loved his character and I've heard it's quite a departure from his Dr. Who role. \n\nYeah. It's pretty, and I want to see it again at some point. However, the story is not memorable at all, and it feels like a bunch of random characters and interesting sets that don't really fit together. \n\nHopefully it's common for  directorial debuts to be weak, so critics don't have to tear Gosling down. In his Q&A someone asked if he'll be directing again and he said \"Hell yeah\"", "Visually stunning. Sets, lighting, locations, imagry and grading. Soundtrack also helps to set a very moody tone. Feels very much a Refn film, I can understand why he recently said they were \"twins\" making the same movies. Matt Smith is great as psycho nutjob, I encourage any Dr Who fans to see this based on his performance alone. Film does feel a bit rushed at the ending (perhaps because of the ten minutes taken out since Cannes).Whole package of visuals, sound and eerie town creates a fantasy like package like OGF, Valhalla Rising or even Blue Velvet, Mullholland Dr. \n\nYes, the plot wasn't the strongest but I don't believe this is enough of an issue to warrant such a tiny limited cinema release on a weekend that the Fast and Furious 7 is playing four times a day in every town. Gosling is a very promising director and once he gets hold of a great script with a really strong story, he may have a universally praised hit on his hands.

Now, the story, being a very visual movie, the dialogue is not completely sparse, but it isn't a whole lot as well. What I got out of it was from the cinematography, set design, and acting. They all helped set up what these characters have gone through. Example being the scene where Hedricks' Billie meets Mendelsohn's Dave, the bank manager, she is alone in his office where portraits of nearly demolished buildings hang from the wall. This is the life they have been experiencing for a long time, and it shows what could very well happen to her and her family. The movie is full of subtext, and if you can open your mind to think on it I think you can get a lot out of it. Another thing is that it focuses on what is not said by the characters. I hate to compare this to Drive(because this is not Drive, Drive is a focused narrative, where this is not focused, it asks you to fill in the blanks for your self), but I feel a similarity with Ronan and De Caestecker's relationship to Gosling and Mulligan's relationship.

That was the shortest 90 minutes ever. Watch this one super baked guys. It's a trip.

Most of the reviews would led you believe that the story is complete nonsense and hard to understand but I thought it was fairly straightforward? It's very clear who Gosling's influences are but Lost River still manages to be fairly original and not just a homage. Sure Lost River has tons of surreal stuff where the meaning behind it was probably an afterthought and things were done simply because it looked cool but hey, I like Harmony Korine so I can't criticize that. Not that it bothered me, but it will probably bother some viewers. I can get behind weirdness for the sake of it. Why? Because it looks cool.

The score is great and the use of colours is interestingly symbolic and fresh. With regards to the story and its coherence, Lost River ain't all that. Gosling clearly has a lot of ideas but fails to join them in a succinct way. This may be intentional, but it leaves the audience in a state of disarray.

The mountain chase is about 20 minutes uninterrupted from start to finish, then about a 10 min break before the 15 minute Abu Dhabi sequence, then a few short action bursts before the 20-minute finale.\n\nJames Wan definitely isn't as skilled at action as Justin Lin (the editing is much more frantic), but he does a terrific job nonetheless given that he's not used to filmmaking at anywhere near this level/budget.\n\nTyrese was fucking hilarious.\n\nNot enough Rock, Ronda Rousey or Lucas Black, though they do make Rocky's screen time count.\n\nAlso thought they could've done a bit more with Statham, but then the movie has 3 badass villains (Jaa and Djimon) so it has plenty to deal with. One thing that was a bit strange [ENDING SPOILERS] (#s \"I was pissed when it looked like Statham died by falling down the rubble, then he just got arrested? I was kinda hoping he'd get brutally crushed to death by the rubble. Will he be back in F8?\")\n\nI was impressed with how little the Paul Walker issue came across.

Sure he's clearly absent from a lot of the final set-piece but there's so much going on it's easy to forget.\n\nThe send-off to Brian was great. I read so much about how emotional it was and as a result I thought it was actually quite tasteful and restrained.

It's even had a warm critical reception.\n\nWorst movie I've seen since Transformers 4. :(\n\nPS: Seriously?

I think it's actually important art.\n\nTo me it's difficult to really give formal critique to these films at this point. The series has sort of transcended, for me anyway, the grounds for everyday film criticism. The lines between the characters, the actors who embody them, as well as the lines between the audience and silver screen are so incredibly blurred that it has become something totally different than any other film/series I can think of. \n\nLast night I sobbed during the final moments of the film.

It was a very nuanced and interesting experience. \n\n\n", "Tons of action, with shitty editing during the 1v1 fights.\n\nAny car chase scene could have been remedied by the protagonist simply stopping the car. \n\nStatham was stupid. The premise was they had to get this program to find him, but he shows up literally everywhere they go. Everywhere. \n\nVin ramps a car into a helicopter and latches a string of grenades to it in mid air. Didn't pull the pin on any of them. Guy he hasn't seen in weeks fires two shots from a pistol and hits the grenade destroying the chopper. Toretto could have simply thrown one grenade for the same outcome. \n\nThey could have eliminated Dubai completely and lost nothing. They break into a $3 million vehicle to get a software item and during nearly get caught. They ramp the vehicle through 2 buildings while it takes 3 seconds to smash an LED screen and grab the item they were originally after. Could have smashed and grabbed and saved the entire thing. Meanwhile Statham, the guy they are after, inexplicably shows up again. Instead of engaging in a 5v1, they ramp the car out of a 40 story building. They destroy 3 towers, terracotta warriors, a $3 million car and steal the software to track a guy that just showed up. Nobody gives chase. \n\nThe fight editing was horrendous, especially for jiu-jitsu brown belt Paul Walker fighting muay thai monster Tony Jaa. \n\nThe entire beginning of the film they had seemed to have filmed on a circular track because the camera was spinning for like 3 minutes straight when Vin called his sister. \n\nI don't ever expect to watch a Fast and Furious movie for an award winning screen play, and during I was entertained, but holy shit afterward I realized how dumb the movie itself was. The tribute to Walker was intense though. Great send off. \n\nI liked a lot of call backs like Hector and the music from Tokyo Drift. \n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, Toretto goes to Han's funeral, sees a Maserati and ditches said funeral unannounced to give chase to said vehicle. Anyone could have been driving. He didn't see a face. And, oh yeah, he's never seen Shaw. Ok. \n\n", "Action movies are starting to look the same for me. This is what Furious 7 felt like, just another action movie. I think it all boils down to how the action scenes are shot. The camera is tight on the action, it frequently moves about, after two or three punches/kicks, it cuts to another angle, and the trend now is for the camera to roll with the action like in Winter Soldier or the Rock's rock bottom move on Statham in this movie.\n\nThe best part for me is the car parachute drop. It has the most \"fun\" vibe of all, and that is what is lacking in the Furious franchise post Fast 5, which is my favorite. I don't think the franchise works when things get too serious. A heist is fun, saving the world is serious stuff and they haven't found out a way to make that fun in the dynamics of the franchise. These are not trained fighters, they are race car drivers, and car drivers aren't that good at fighting bad guys. But as the franchise moves on, as can be seen from this latest one, things are going to stay or get even more serious. I hope it doesn't.\n\nAs for the non-action parts of the movie, they are just there to tie everything together, nothing remarkable except the final tribute to Paul Walker. The cgi face for him is good. You have too look real close to even recognize it. It's a good sendoff for him. Overall it's not bad, but it's not great either.

There's one scene, which I will NOT spoil, that literally had me shaking in my seat, overwhelmed by a sense of pure intensity. My heart was ready to go out of my chest. I was sweating and breathing harshly. And when it ended, I was crying at the newfound realization of what a single scene can do. But that was ONE MOMENT, in a three-hour masterpiece. The music...oh my god, the music. The music is so brilliantly intense and emotional. It's the same three notes, played upon with different instruments and tempos and styles. A single theme which keeps coming back. But at several points, it begins with a simply synthesizer, and over the course of minutes, picks up, and up, and up, in what is EASILY the greatest musical crescendo I've ever encountered. Unlike almost any song, this melody NEVER silences as it plays. It never slows or whittles down. It only gets higher, and higher, and higher. The result is music that feels justifying of a grand realization of the nature of the entire Universe. Pure euphoria, in the most genuine sense. By the credits roll, I was frozen.

It was hard to tell what time it was as we were being woken up at odd hours with chanting/singing and 'team building' games. \n\nThe crux of the entire weekend, however, were the mandatory 'confession circles' which all teens had to attend. We sat in a large circle, in a dimly lit room, and one by one were expected to express, reveal and purge dark secrets or mistakes that we were making in our lives. The pressure to do so was unreal. Not talking was not an option. Not revealing something was not an option.\n\nTalking about it days later with friends, a lot of us made stuff up just so we wouldn't look like outsiders, wouldn't have the leaders disbelieve that we could be happy, and good, with our lives. \n\nEven back then I knew it was highly manipulative, but even knowing that it was still highly effective.

I thought long and hard about what constitutes a religion. I looked around and tried to find a comman thread among all religions. And I did. Faith. Faith is believing in what you can't see. Its taking your belief with no physical evidence. It is why science and religion hate each other. Scientology claims to be a \"exact proven science\". If it is an exact proven science then nothing is faith based. The claims of proof are of course false, but they should not be able to have it both ways. In an Interview with Ted Coppel, Miscavige argues that scientology is not faith based. If it not faith based. If they have the proof of this \"science\" then is it really a religion? Or is it an enterprise? It really saddens me that the IRS gave in to the pressure of scientology law suits.

I know the trailer looks awesome and a lot of amazing people unrelated to Scientology worked on it. But Tom Cruise is culpable for the evils of Scientology.

I hope there is still some ongoing discussion here.\n\nOne of the things that caught my attention the most was the use of color in wardrobe and set pieces, specifically red, white, and blue.  [The kids wear blue in almost every scene.](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--k-vXkfaP--/bp76ax3vviw2gjrtt27j.jpg). Blue may represent innocence and sexual immaturity.  Red, then, would signify sexual maturity.  This is fitting considering the association of blood and loss of virginity/ innocence.  \n\nRed is worn exclusively by adults in the film, including an adult neighbor and the office worker at the high school they go to to track down Hugh. Those were just a couple caught once I started looking, I'm sure there are more. [Hugh and Jay both wear red after they have sex](http://minnesotaconnected.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/It_Follows_1.jpg).  Jay wears a bold red dress when they are in the hospital near the end of the film, after having sex with Paul. The color red seeps into and takes over the color blue in various ways throughout the movie.  Jay's head wound results in a bandage with a spot of blood.  The blue car is rusting (aging) into a reddish color.  At the end of the pool scene red blood overwhelms the blue water. Water is often portrayed as being blue, and IT didn't like water.\n\nIT was definitely associated with white.  Maybe due to bodies becoming white after dying and losing their blood/ reddish tone.  For sure though... every time IT was portrayed, it wore white.  What was really interesting to me was when the group went into Hugh's secure house.  In the closet they find one hanging outfit, which included a white shirt.  It was like his clothes were already picked out for when he inevitably becomes IT (or IT becomes him).\n\nMy favorite part of this use of red, white, and blue takes place near the end of the film. There is a blatant close up of the comforter that Jay and Paul lay under after having sex.  It has stripes of red, white, and blue.  All three colors come together, possibly defeating IT?  Taking this red, white, and blue theme one step further (and maybe one step too far)... the story takes place in Detroit, a city where the ugly reality of the American dream showed its face.  In teen sex horror movies, the American dream is sex and the ugly reality is the horror. \n\nThere was a lot of subtext and unexplained direction in this movie, which I loved.

I believe the reason it took so long for the monster to get to Greg is because he had sex with another girl a day after he got it from Jay but didn't want to tell anyone. Any thoughts? \n\n2. I also have a theory that the monster just doesn't walk but spawns near you. We know it isn't transparent it's invisible so if an invisible monster was walking miles and miles a day someone would run into it or it would get hit buy a bus or a car. So if you run far enough it will only buy you a few days then the monster materializes a few miles near you and starts the slow walk. \n\n3. Through lore what most likely is this monster? \n\n4.

The last one Jay saw (in the movie at least) was her Dad at the pool, revealed after the scene in the family portrait. Greg's last one was his mother. And the girl at the beginning was talking to her dad, but she looks up and to the side of the car where the camera lingers, but she doesn't freak out she just keeps apologizing as though she switched what direction she was talking to. Maybe she was seeing her dad. Which plays nice with the  not-quite-shame-but-everything-is-very-changed theme towards sex throughout the movie.", "I know this is probably dead now and no one is reading this, but I just finished watching it and one of my favorite parts with the movie was coming to the realization that I knew just as much as the characters did, a luxury that only movies willing to try new things are able to provide.

Done Deal etc...\n\nThe MANY subtleties in the movie were fantastic too! I love that they didn't treat the audience like an idiot, there were times when the camera didn't focus on someone walking directly towards it, but it was still visible enough to make the viewer question. All of that conditioning, in a sense, is what makes the ending shot so fantastic in my opinion as well!

I loved The Shining for the atmosphere and the brilliant use of music, and I felt like It Follows was one of the best examples of that that I've seen.", "Spoilers Ahead\n\nI think I've figured this movie out. It's one of those movies that if you take it at face value, I think the average moviegoer will leave the theater unsatisfied. But if you watch closely, all the clues are there. I think the movie is trying to say meaningless sex is false intimacy. Having sex with random people is not going to make you happy, but strong committed relationships will. Jay talks about dreaming of driving out to a cabin with a boy when she was younger, only to immediately be chloroformed. The movie was saying our childhood fantasies of sex are just that - fantasies. They last very briefly, aren't as great as they're made out to be, and can come back to haunt you. This is made clear by the conversation after Jay and Paul have sex. They ask each other the same question: Do you feel any different? They answer the same: no. Jay doesn't feel the curse lift, and Paul (who has been trying to have sex with Jay the entire movie) doesn't feel as satisfied as he thought he would. On the other hand, all the true relationships in the movie, (like between Jay and her sister) are strong, built on loyalty, and can literally save your life. The ending shows us this when Paul decides to not have the easy fix by giving the curse to prostitutes (and living with their deaths on his conscience) who will easily pass it along, but rather to stick by her side and fight it out with her. The movie was a very \"show dont tell\" movie. It showed us in subtle ways that her mother was an alcoholic and her father was out of the picture/deceased. So we can assume Jay was brought up on bad relationships. \nDefinitely some of the most solid, suspenseful horror filmmaking I've seen in a long while, and I give it even more respect for trusting the audiences intelligence and not spelling out the many intricacies of the plot and subtext.", "Would the transfer still work if the guy used a condom? Because I'm pretty sure none were used in the movie.", "I finally saw It Follows last night.\n\nAside from the amazing score and downright beautiful lighting and cinematography, what stuck with me most was the feeling that \"It\" was simply Death - or perhaps awareness of our own mortality.\n\nIt reminded me of a passage from a Carlos Castaneda book, which I have finally tracked down and shall now post here to share with you:\n\n__________________\n\n\"The traffic was minimal. Few cars passed by from the opposite direction. It seemed as if we\nwere the only people going south on the highway. I thought that was strange and I kept on\nlooking in the rear-view mirror to see if there were other cars coming from behind, but there\nwere none.\nAfter a while I stopped looking for cars and began to dwell again on the prospect of our trip.\nThen I noticed that my headlights seemed extremely bright in contrast with the darkness all\naround and I looked again in the rear-view mirror. I saw a bright glare first and then two\npoints of light that seemed to have emerged from the ground. They were the headlights of a\ncar on a hilltop in the distance behind us. They remained visible for a while, then they\ndisappeared into the darkness as if they had been scooped away; after a moment they\nappeared on another hilltop, and then they disappeared again.\nI followed their appearances and disappearances in the mirror for a long time. At one point it\noccurred to me that the car was gaining on us. It was definitely closing in. The lights were\nbigger and brighter. I deliberately stepped on the gas pedal. I had a sensation of uneasiness.\nDon Juan seemed to notice my concern, or perhaps he was only noticing that I was speeding\nup. He looked at me first, then he turned around and looked at the distant headlights.\nHe asked me if there was something wrong with me. I told him that I had not seen any cars\nbehind us for hours and that suddenly I had noticed the lights of a car that seemed to be\ngaining on us all the time.\nHe chuckled and asked me if I really thought it was a car. I told him that it had to be a car and\nhe said that my concern revealed to him that, somehow, I must have felt that whatever was\nbehind us was something more than a mere car. I insisted that I thought it was just another car\non the highway, or perhaps a truck.\n\"What else can it be?\" I said loudly.\nDon Juan's probing had put me on edge.\nHe turned and looked straight at me, then he nodded slowly, as if measuring what he was\ngoing to say.\n\"Those are the lights on the head of death,\" he said softly. \"Death puts them on like a hat and\nthen shoots off on a gallop. Those are the lights of death on the gallop gaining on us, getting\ncloser and closer.\"\nA chill ran up my back. After a while I looked in the rear-view mirror again, but the lights\nwere not there any more.\nI told don Juan that the car must have stopped or turned off the road. He did not look back; he\njust stretched his arms and yawned.\n\"No,\" he said. \"Death never stops. Sometimes it turns off its lights, that's all.\"\n\n___________________\n\nWhat do you think?", "Herpes has evolved.", "This movie looks great, or least better than anything else that's out.

You think they'd put their head's together a bit, especially with Hugh who seems to have had it awhile and learned to deal with it (his house seemed designed to keep him safe). Things that bothered me:\n\n* They never calculate how fast it is going or seem to be aware of where it is coming from. You could pretty accurately estimate when it would show up and from which direction, but they just estimated and turned their back to it sometimes.\n\n* If it can have a sheet thrown over it, couldn't you douse it in paint? Wouldn't people seeing that thing covered in paint walking around town make people believe them and help everyone see the follower?\n\n* House with two doors: it follows in, someone closes door behind it, you leave out the back and trap it inside. Then brick up the house. Why was this idea not tried?\n\nAgain, I think it was a smart movie, but for the sake of telling a scary story you had to dumb it down a bit to put characters in danger.", "You know a movie is good when ya can hum the theme tune when you leave the screening. It Follows is a tremendous, off beat, throwback horror flick that is tense, gripping and most importantly - creepy as fuck. Putting an interesting twist on horror genre conventions, It Follows combines chilling cinematography with a twisted John Carpenter like electronic score that evokes a spine tingling resonance felt by each and every audience member. Interesting twists and relatable characters that you care for keep the momentum of the film going allowing you to seep further into the surreal suburban environment. I thoroughly enjoyed the film, however, those interested in jump scares and gore from their horror might want to look elsewhere. While It Follows certainly delivers those elements occasionally, David Robert Mitchell's direction is much more focussed on the macabre and creepier elements of horror. ", "I guess this isn't getting stickied???\n\n--\n\nSpeculation time: I loved the psycho-sexual nature of the creature. I noticed there were a few interesting iterations of the people that she knew which it appeared to her as:\n\n* The peeping tom kid\n\n* Yara, who she had a weird relationship with, possibly as a result of Paul kissing her (his own sister) right after she had her first kiss with him, effectively hurting their connection.\n\n* Her father, who was absent from their lives and who she was reluctant to tell her sister it appeared as. The mother's alcoholism was established early on, and the neighbor's mom was quick to point out that they were screwed up. I thought this was a purposefully ambiguous reference to possible abuse in their past. A true haunting specter that she couldn't shake. \n\n* Various naked people, and this is the most obvious one I guess.\n\n* Seeming past victims (all being related by sex).\n\n\n-- Did anyone have similar thoughts regarding these character relationships? The idea that the creature murders people in such a horrifying sexual way was a real surprise, and contributed excellently to the premise.", "I really enjoyed the way they made it seem like they were driving to some sketchy cabin in the woods, but then it ended up being a nice beach house.", "Does anyone know what Yara's seashell is?

'It' represents the guilt/shame/destruction of innocence that follows a rape victim (usually) their whole lives. I see a lot of people saying that 'It' represents death or the end of innocence and I agree, it represents all of that good stuff. These are themes in a story that is clearly about a rape victim. \n\nMoments where it's super clear.\n\n1. Jay doesn't want to say the form that It has taken (if you missed it, it's her dad). Her father is absent and obviously some form of abuse happened in that house. Moments where she says 'I can't be in this house' could be read two ways. The moment where her father is naked on the roof of her house is literally what she sees when she looks at her house. She sees her father naked and savage. This is probably why her character starts off so disaffected and talking about wanting to be someone else. \n\n2. Another moment that seems obvious is when It is in the kitchenette. It's form is a woman with running mascara, her bra half ripped off, and she's peeing. This might be digging a little deep, but bedwetting is a sign of sexual abuse. Either way its a lack of control of ones body, which is a feeling that exists sometimes forever in the mind of a rape victim. (The lack of consistency is confusing to me on this one. For the shot where It breaks into Greg's house, It has to be Greg to have that moment of tension. When Jay is chased down in school, it's an old woman, and this doesn't make sense unless It symbolizes the realization of your own mortality that comes with the end of childhood. This movie's lack of commitment to it's symbolism is my biggest problem with it. Even the peeing girl is a little weird, I mean, what does that really symbolize? It's mostly just a big cue for the viewer that also works as a horror visual. If it's the literal ghosts of the people who fucked up their lives (and to me, that seems most compelling) then set that up and pay us off. The part where Greg gets fucked to death by his secreting mom is awesome, but I don't get why it's his mom, it should have been Jay. Theres probably a very freudian review of this online somewhere, but I wouldn't trust that guy)\n\n3. This is my weirdest speculation. The paul/hooker shot could be read two ways. One reading supports my case. The part where they look at each other and realized nothing has changed is Paul's loss of innocence. He builds up this relationship with Jay in his mind, but when he is intimate with her he comes out unchanged. This is exemplified by the weird sex scene where it looks like she's fucking him. Paul looks at the hookers and sees them as an option now. He now knows sex isn't special. Jay isn't special. He isn't special.\n\n\n\nIt's a story of a disaffected girl learning to love and leave the cycle of abuse behind. I think Hugh could be just a exposition guy/the writer having to root the rules of the film in a slight reality. This is a guy who either made her remember her abuse or used her for sex and made her have a sort of relapse. Remember that scene where Hugh is dumping her in the road and then the following scene where she's talking to the cops telling them through tears it was consensual? That could be read multiple ways. Many times victims will try to protect their abuser. She also grew up protecting her father, so it makes sense.\n\nAlso did anyone notice the piss theme? Talking about peeing in the pool. Peeing at the beach. Peeing It. There was another one i think. \n\nOk. Thoughts?", "Just saw this and I've spent some time to think about it. I have some questions/theories that I kind of want to talk about.\n\nDo you guys think that Jay and Paul knew that it was following them at the end? The way they looked so careless and walked so slow, but not *too* slow. They never bothered turning around or anything, to me it looked like they were just trying to live with it. Or maybe even starting to give up as the girl had in the beginning.\n\nThe opening scene, honestly, looked kind of dumb. The sight of this girl running around in a circle just to run right back into her house is just funny. But, after some thought, I think I realized what the director was trying to show us. Maybe it was showing us how it looked to watch someone with It following them, and how crazy and stupid they looked. Any ideas on that scene?\n\nDo you guys think that Paul had sex with any of those prostitutes? Or do you think that he couldn't go through with it, and that's why the creature had caught up with them so quickly in the end.\n\nI was wondering if Jay was starting to feel guilty about Greg dying and then pretty much killing those guys on the boat by having sex with them (presumably).\n\nAnyone have anything interesting that they have been thinking about? I just can't stop pondering, and I need to talk about it!", "The girl in the opening scene who gets killed is not the protagonist right?", "It'd be worth getting humped to death by a sex demon in the form of an old woman just to get to bang that main actress.", "**SPOILERS**\n\nIn my opinion the movie wasn't about STDs, but rather pregnancy. The first couple scenes have the characters reminiscing about about their childhoods (first kisses, high school romances, when Hugh points to the kid during the movie line). Then, Hugh gives Jay his problem (the pregnancy), and *It Follows* her. She looks for some man to be her savior, but every guy leaves her stranded and helpless - nobody wants to deal with her issues. Finally, she accepts that Paul is the only person who will share her burden. The finale ends with them accepting that they need each other in order to survive in this bleak, lonely world.\n\nIt Follows is about how fucking a dude isn't going to automatically fix your problems; issues get dealt with in a committed relationship. It won't be perfect and it's not what you dreamed of, but it's what works.", "I swear to god the writer/director must have been heavily influenced by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QFwo57WKwg).", "Loved it so much that when my friend said she hated it we stood outside of the theater and polled people with the vast majority agreeing with me.

Maybe he knew more than he let on? ", "One of the things which I like about this movie is that in the **It Follows** universe, parents/grown ups don't exist at all lol. Ofc I know that we see Jay's dad in the first scene and Greg's ~~mom~~ later on, but for the rest of the movie they're not there at all and the kids do alot of stuff that just wouldn't happen if there were grown ups there.\n\nAt first I was like, *This is unrealistic.* but then I realized *Why does it have to be? It's a movie.* And the director obviously knew too but he left it out anyways cus not everything needs to be explained. It's a stylistic choice. \n\nThe point is that many people have similar complaints about this movie but all I'm saying they should just get their head out their asses, sit back and enjoy it.", "The only negative I can think of was the lack of mythology for \"it\" and sometimes the bits we did know taking the intensity out of certain scenes (for example, the nurse in one of the the hospital scenes was walking too fast to be the monster) and the actor who played Hugh/Jeff was a little flat.\n\nThat being said, even as someone who doesn't watch a lot of horror films, this was a pretty great movie. Many scenes have a lot of intensity and genuine thrill, the influence of Carpenter and *The Shining* were there but not overwrought. \n\nMaika Monroe was great again as she was in Adam Wingard's *The Guest* as were other actors in this film, like Keir Gilchrist (Paul). \n\nMitchell did a good job directing and his script was pretty good as well, the few jump scares there were had an old fashioned vibe to them and were few and far between, he also did create tension very well.\n\nAlso, the cinematography was gorgeous, especially any of the scenes on a beach or by the lake, really beautiful work. \n\nP.S. Did anyone else catch a pirate-y vibe with Jay's \"X\" tattoo or the dark red/\"black spot\" on her head after the car accident? I made a connection to those but it's probably not the case. \n\nOverall though great movie very well done.  ", "Love the movie, but some of these posters are a bit annoying.\nPeople trying to figure out what It is a metaphor to, and I'm here thinking this:\nhttp://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/The_2de74d_2130342.jpg", "The part that really scared me shitless was when Jay ran inside Greg's house to try an save him, then she encountered 'It' aggressively knocking on his door; and then it pauses knocking for a second to take a moment to acknowledge Jay's existence, then stare at her for a second, then continues. that drove chills up my spine that it did that. like why did it do that?? did it dislike how Jay was trying to warn him? did it want to kill her but knew it had to kill greg first? did it want to scare her away? did it want her to know that it acknowledges her too? did it want to signal her that it was coming for her next??\n\nWith that being said. It obviously thought something, it thought to do that at the very least. So I kind of have to argue against how 'it' \"doesn't think.\" it has to. Why does it grab a rock and throw it at a window, it has to think to do that. Why did it start grabbing the electronics at the pool scene and began chucking them at jay, it really had to think to do that you know?", "I've been disappointed to see this film fare worse in reviews with viewers than with the critics. \n\nSeems rare to see a horror film that is nearly universally praised by critics but getting average ratings by casual viewers.\n\nFor me, I side with the critics - I think this is one of the most high-concept and brilliant horror films ever. \n\nPerhaps the people who dislike the film are not looking at \"it\" as a metaphor? Just taking everything on face value? Personally I thought \"it\" being Death/our sense of our own mortality personified was pretty blatant, especially with the Dostoevsky quotes peppered in throughout... and I thought the atmosphere, cinematography and score were too tight and pitch perfect to allow anyone to interpret it as \"just a monster movie\" as the great care taken seemed as evident to me as Kubrick's placement of seemingly random objects in his set backgrounds... but maybe I'm just reading too much into it. \n\nWhat do you think, Reddit peeps?", "Just got home from the movie. I liked it okay, but I was never really scared. I don't feel like it lived up to all the claims and 5 star reviews. It was unsettling at times, but it's kind of hard not to see it as just a metaphor for STDs among today's youth. And there were parts that just came across as funny that kind of killed the mood at times. If you're curious at all about the film, go ahead and give it a watch. It's definitely an unsettling premise and the score is pretty fantastic. Overall I think the critical and fan response will generate more demand for movies that are more out of the box like this, which is always a good thing.", "I saw this film with high expectations and felt quite miserable when it didn't reach them. Just like The Babadook (a much better movie than this), it's suffered from having far too much festival hype and effusive 5-star reviews.\n\nI will say first off that the visuals, score and acting is all really good, but I felt like they totally squandered a great idea. I figured they'd establish the ground rules in act 1 and then have the STD thing get passed around a bunch of horny youngsters, but this idea is introduced pretty late in the movie and it's only passed to like 2 people IIRC (I saw it about 6 weeks ago so correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nAlso wasn't a fan of the slow pacing, and I felt like it didn't really differentiate itself in terms of scares. *ratchet up soundtrack to deafening levels whenever the antagonist shows up*\n\nThe idea that it could be anyone was great, but ehh, I just wasn't scared. And I thought the swimming pool finale was very silly.\n\nI did love the final shot though, a total troll to my audience who just groaned their asses off.\n\nEasily the most overrated horror film I've seen in a long time, but I will definitely be checking it out again when it's on DVD/VOD.", "I just saw this movie tonight and I have to say I thought it was boring, blase and way over-rated.

At the beach, on the couch, by the pool, on the porch, etc. etc. the same thing kept happening over and over and when I finally thought it something was gonna happen it just ended up as a whole lot of nothing. LAME.", "I think some people have had some interesting ideas in this movie implying it is about STD's and Pregnancy but, I think they might be reading into things that aren't really there while ignoring some of the more obvious things the movie wants you to think about. I also think if the monster represented rape trauma Jay would have been raped instead of having consensual sex. I think a lot of these interpretations have merit but, is an oversimplification of a very complex monster. I would like to say I loved this movie and it really is multi-layered. \n\nThere are two obvious themes in this movie: sex and death.\n\nI think the monster represents multiple things but, first and foremost it represents the impending death we all must face one day aka the oldest literary theme there is. This is made painfully clear by the poems the girl with glasses is reading throughout the movie especially the one at the end. The monster takes many forms, some people see it coming while others cannot, sometimes we can fight it sometimes it takes its victim instantly, some people are in constant fright of the monsters while other refuse to acknowledge it. All of these things can also be said about death. On top of that we see the many times the monster takes the form of one of its dead victims and very early on takes the form of an old women in hospital garbs, perhaps this is Jay looking at what one day she will look like when she is on her death bed. It frightens her and she runs from it but her fate, her death bed, her monster is always following her, unshakable, persistent.\n\nOne of the most interesting things in the movie is the nature of the monster itself, the movie doesn't explain what it is so any guess or interpretation is as good as the other. \n\nWhat we can analyze though is the forms the monster takes. After the death scene with Greg we see that the monsters intentions is to brutally murder its victims and to sexualize him or her. So we know this monster is driven by death and sex. This is where a ton of different things come into play and there are many ways to interpret the monster.\n\n-The monster is always wearing white and is never fully clothed except the time it takes the form as Yara and is in a very short dress and a couple other times it is naked. In most cases white represents purity or virginity. Perhaps this is a type of symbolism where the monster represents the lost purity of its targets? Its a loose comparison but, it's the best I can come up with. \n\nI personally believe that the monster does not have direct control over the shapes it takes. As it was breaking into Gregs house it took the form of Greg implying that it was thinking about Greg, obsessed with Greg, it was focused on Greg it couldn't help but, turn into him. It is obsessed with sex like I said it always takes the form of scantily clad or naked people. As it gets closer to consuming its victims it starts to change more rapidly because the monster is becoming excited and can't control itself.  At first it might turn into one of its past victims or a naked person because it is aroused and is reverting into something that it associates with an arousing memory. As the victim flees it becomes frustrated and more aggressive evidenced by it turning into more intimidating people like the 9 foot tall guy and the screaming child. It will also turn into its victims naked parents where there is some definite Oedipus/Electra complex stuff going on.\n\nI think the real terror of the film comes from what the monster turns people into. It perverts them by coaxing them into having sex with people and in a way killing them. It also makes people extremely paranoid constantly, there is no relaxing when this monster is after you, it could show up at any point. It dehumanizes people and ruins their lives even if they are effective at getting away from the monster. Could you imagine having that crushing paranoia the rest of your life?\n\nI liked the ending scene. It was working a couple different levels. First we see a figure behind Paul and Jay. This might be the monster or it might be a random person the point is they are not letting it bother them. Their love is triumphing over the monster. They are also wearing white which might be indicative of their pure love which is the first time we see it in the movie.\n\nThere is a lot more to talk about in this movie but, I am tired of typing.\n\nPS: As for people talking about their strategy for getting rid of the monster with convoluted plans of transcontinental hookers.

There were several scenes in the preview that did not make it to film.  The \"good\" joke from the preview was reused quite badly at the end of the movie in a way that said, \"Hey, remember that joke that did so well in the preview?!  We noticed that you liked it!\"  Also, the Rihanna music was badly inserted into the film in ways that did not work at all.  Particularly the dance scene.", "Saw this at a preview a few weeks ago.

While Alice in Wonderland and Maleficent were re-imaginings, Cinderella is retold respectfully for the new generation. I genuinely believe that Disney did something right with their latest live-action film. While most people were probably expecting a sword-wielding action hero, I'm happy that Disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect. The story of Cinderella is very personal to each person who has felt like the underdog, but managed to rise like a Phoenix from the ashes in the end. If Walt Disney were alive today, I'm sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little savior be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way. Bravo!", "I absolutely loved it. Obviously the technical stuff such as sets and costumes were wonderful, but the script here is really good here in general, not just for a fairy tale movie. Both the Grand Duke and the Wicked Stepmother are three-dimensional characters, and even in the end, you feel bad for Lady Tremaine and the lot she was dealt in life, even though she is still utterly despicable. A lot of that is thanks to Blanchett's performance which is both hammy and grounded. Lily James and Richard Madden both become stars here, the former anchoring the movie with a optimism that makes Ella more than just a princess, a human being, and the latter who is appropriately charming but also has the best acting scene of the movie with Derek Jacobi near the end of the film.

The movie bears little effort to deviate from the animated classic of the same title, and obviously eyes young children as its target audience, making it hardly a reimagining, but plainly a retelling. Through this simplicity, though, the attempt works with immense success.\n\nCinderella, unlike last year's Maleficent's dark take, is sprinkled with bright, vivid glistening colors. Even the stepmother and stepsisters are not as brutal and heartless as we've always remembered them from the fairytale. Well, of course, one can't expect these antagonists to be as kind as we'd like to imagine them to be, but still, that wicked stepmother we always knew, is missing.\n\nAs always, central to any fairytale, is a lingering message of love, and all other similar anthems radiating around it. Surely, the same can be said with Cinderella, as it emphasizes courage and kindness. Perfection may not be totally applicable, nonetheless, Cinderella's flaws are the very things that let those small yet perfect moments shine: the short yet magical encounter between Ella and the fairy god- mother, the first time she met the prince, and the royal ball dance. Added to that, is a little humor too, courtesy of the fairy godmother and the little creatures that assumed bigger forms (some in human) through her magic, and, surprisingly, the step sisters.\n\nCinderella is barely something new, but what makes it memorable is that it brings something we've always only imagined, into life, taking nothing from it or adding something to it to push the story off its original course. On moments when Ella and the prince are put into the spotlight, the musical score conjures its own magic to bring the magnitude of romance into magical levels. It will come across as just another story we love, but maybe that's what makes it strike a chord, an experience worth going through again and again. Visually stunning and emotionally-charged, Cinderella hits home in delivering this universally loved story.", "Bought a ticket last night *hoping* that they wouldn't demolish one of my favorite Disney movies, and I have to say they did really really well.

In Tangled, the animators referenced it as inspiration and in Frozen the painting appears in castle as a tribute.

Lily James is charming, and you feel and root for her every step of the way. Absolutely perfect for the role. That final \"I forgive you\" is intensely satisfying. \n\nCate Blanchett as the antagonist is right on spot, she remains every bit despicable yet there are glimpses of her inner pain from time to time. When she looked into the study room and saw Ella's father hugging Ella before he leaves, telling Ella that he will always love Ella's mother and that's who most important in his heart, you can see the Stepmother's pain upon hearing those words. Being a second choice that will never replace the first. When she saw that the father only delivers a branch back to Ella and nothing that her daughters ask for. She knew her place in the Father's heart will never surpass Ella and Ella's mother. Her monologue when she wants Ella to tell her story really hits hard as well.\n\nI like how every character are all motivated by different things, and not inherently just good or bad. The King loves his son as much as his kingdom, The Grand Duke is concerned with the stability of the kingdom, The Prince is attracted by Cinderella not just by her beauty but also her wit and kindness, The Stepsisters while being spoiled brats that want very much to marry the prince they still admit that the \"mystery Princess\" is a perfect match for the Prince. \n\nBranagh and Weitz really brought the characters to life, bringing an age old story to the current generation by telling a story of people that we can actually relate to.

Everyone knows this story.\n\nThe acting was fantastic. Cat Blanchett, of course, was fantastic. She was so cruel and just utterly terrible! Lily James also did a good job. She really nailed the character of Cinderella. Both the actresses playing the stepsisters were hilarious and I really thought Helena did fantastic work as the fairy god mother.\n\nBut what really sell this movie is the visuals.

The prince/king dynamic felt more than caricature here. I felt the stepsisters were portrayed well. They were stupid but believably stupid if that makes sense?

I like how the mice were downplayed to mere cameos (In order, I believe, to give more screen time to the other characters) but still felt in place in the movie. Also, I like how they set more time aside in the story to at least flesh out Kits and Ellas attraction. The movie, also, as everyone is saying, is beautiful, and the soundtrack surprisingly memorable. I will definitely buy it when it comes out in DVD.\nA few minor points I felt where not very good however where: I liked the 1950 godmother better, not that Helena Bonham Carter was bad, far from it, but I just cant explain why the old one was better. Cate Blanchett wardrobe, at time, looked more like something out of the 1940s, not the quasy mediaval time set of the movie.

Brother saw it at the premiere on Thursday and said it was great.", "I loved that when Ella was getting eggs from the hen hut you could hear her start to sing \"Sing Sweet Nightingale.\" I loved that they choose an old nursery rhyme to use instead of an original song. Every character had deminsion and purpose, except the Grand Duke, but who likes him. \"There are no other ladies in this household I ho-- I presume.\" lols", "The latest installment in what promises to be a long parade of live-action updates to classic Disney stories, Cinderella revisits the beloved fairy tale with a few minor changes to spruce things up a bit. We all know the story of the kind young girl, abused and mistreated by her cruel stepmother and her equally vicious offspring, but screenwriter Chris Weitz introduces a few new twists along the way.\n\nThis time around, we actually get to spend some time with the girl's mother (Hayley Atwell), who instills young Ella with the belief that one should always be kind and courageous. There's also her doting father (Ben Chaplin), a merchant whose brilliant smile masks a sorrow the likes of which many of us can never know. As he continues to grow older, and his daughter (Lily James) blossoms into womanhood, he decides to remarry.\n\nThe new addition to the household is Lady Tremaine (Cate Blanchett), who arrives along with her dim-witted daughters Drisella (Sophia McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger). The trio scoffs at the simple country dwelling that Ella and her father call home - their tastes are much more refined, you see - and it doesn't take long before Lady Tremaine is throwing lavish parties and rubbing elbows with all manner of noble folk.\n\nWhen Ella's father succumbs to illness on a business trip, the young girl is devastated. So is Lady Tremaine, albeit for different reasons entirely. \"We're ruined,\" she tells her daughters, storming off while Ella weeps in the foyer after receiving the news. Soon, the household staff are dismissed and Ella finds herself cooking, cleaning, and sewing, resigned to living in the attic, while her new relatives continue to squander what little money the family has left.\n\nMost of this probably sounds familiar, and indeed, the film hews closely to the 1950s animated version, but another significant revision occurs when Cinderella - a moniker bestowed upon her by one of her stepsisters - encounters the Prince (Richard Madden) while riding in the forest. Captivated by her beauty and impressed by her spirit, he convinces his father (Ben Jacobi) to extend invitations to the upcoming Royal Ball to commoners and nobles alike, hoping for another meeting with the mysterious woman from the forest.\n\nYou can probably guess where things go from here: a pumpkin turns into a carriage, mice are transformed into horses, and Cinderella gets a pair of glass slippers. All of this comes courtesy of her fairy godmother (Helena Bonham Carter in a delightfully silly appearance), and Cinderella is off to the ball with a spell to mask her identity, enjoying a lovely evening with her handsome Prince before racing out of the palace as the magic begin to wear off.\n\nWhile the narrative may not have undergone the same sort of bold - and ultimately flawed - retelling as last year's Maleficent, director Kenneth Branagh makes old feel new again with spectacular costumes and dazzling production design. Nearly every frame of Cinderella is stunningly gorgeous, and the special effects - of which there are many - bring to life the magic of the animated classic in breathtaking detail.\n\nLikewise, the performances are every bit as strong as the visuals. James approaches her role with a plucky, spirited confidence, while Madden dials up the charm to full volume, but it's Blanchett who really stands out here. Malice seems to drip from her pores and emanate from every fiber of her being, and her abject cruelty toward Cinderella is both terrifying and heartbreaking.\n\nBut this is Disney, after all, and audiences should know they're in for a happy ending. In fact, you shouldn't be too surprised to learn that the film's final act also bears a striking resemblance to its animated counterpart. This new Cinderella certainly won't be taking home any awards for originality, but what it lacks in new ideas it more than makes up for in the sheer quality of presentation.", "I saw it yesterday,Lily James has been so pretty.That was so good movie ", "Wasn't expecting much going in, and that's about what I got out of it. Pretty basic Disney retelling, nothing new here. The backgrounds looked gorgeous, as well as the costumes. \n\nThe Frozen short did not disappoint, excellent in all regards.", "Kenneth Branagh has a wonderful eye and sense of grandeur. Also great is the casting. Cate Blanchett probably had a lot of fun being a bitch (as a compliment to her performance).\n\nI also like how no bullshit \"progressive\" subversion was shoe horned. It was more than just a simple retelling. Branagh added humanity and dimension to all the characters and a lot of dignity and grace. \n\nBring on the remakes, Disney. So long as they're like this or better, I'll have no problem being dragged by my girlfriend to the theater.", "Everything's already been said since I tend to come to these parties pretty late but the only thing I didn't like was how it seemed ham-fisted the way they introduced black characters into the story. It's almost as if they realized while going through storyboards that the movie is too white. \n\nThey went and got the Tyler Perry looking dude from Game of Thrones to play a henchman-esque role and there was a quaint scene with one black family trying on the slipper but other than that, it seemed wholly unnecessary. It's nice to see an effort at diversification but don't make it obvious like this. ", "Saw it last week. I thought it was amazing. Never liked the story of Cinderella and the original animated movie, but this one just worked for me on all levels. Visuals and use of color were stunning and Lily James and Cate Blanchett killed it as Ella and Stepmother. Kudos to Richard Madden for his performance, even better than in GoT. Music was great and the story, while simple, was very heartfelt and touching. Shed tears multiple times. And that song at the end is just so beautiful. Can't find anything bad to say about the movie.

The police force in one city has introduced some mechanized officers to put fewer human officers in harm's way. Human cops still exist and they mention at one point that if the program continues to work well in Johannesburg they can start trying it other places, so this is only in one city, and the robotic officers are represented as fighting legitimate crimes with appropriate force, not as oppressive.\n\n\"But now, the people are fighting back.\" No, the general populace is not fighting back, criminals are. 2 of the main characters of the movie are criminals, they have conflict with the police because they commit crimes intentionally, and they try to steal a police robot to help them commit more crimes.

I was not expecting the whole major plot element with the gangsters, but for me it was a very pleasant surprise.  I thought the gangsters made the movie infinitely better and way more entertaining.

The action in the movie for me was brutal and awesome, everything I expected.

Personally, I loved it but the person I was with was highly disappointed. The visuals were absolutely stunning and the cinematography equally so. For me this movie was all about the Feels. Neil Blomkamp really had me feeling for this A.I. unlike any other I've seen in a movie before. However, I do feel as though the plot was a bit disjointed.\n\nIn my opinion, Hugh Jackman's character was crap. His motives just weren't all there and I feel as though he behaved in the typical villain fashion. I understand that they needed some form of plot development beyond the fact that they created this poor A.I. that was already doomed to die in five days, but it felt to me like his character was drawn in at the last minute. I think the writers had too much on their plate. There was enough going on as it was.\n\nAlso, Sigourney Weaver disappointed me. As the head of a major corporation, she made some pretty rash decisions toward the end there. Also, how the HELL did they get away with releasing a massive militarized weapon on the city?\n\nThat being said, Dev Patel was great and Sharlto Copley was on point as always. It was interesting to see Yolandi acting...but she pulled it off alright. Her character was hard not to love, at least. The film may not have had the best plot (IMO) but it definitely entertained. It had me laughing and *close to* crying on several occasions. All in all, certainly worth the price of a movie ticket. ", "It got hard to watch when Chappie was either mentally or physically abused.

For a long time Avatar was my favourite, but it's been dethroned by Chappie!\n\nDuring the entire movie I felt sympathy for Chappie, he didn't know that he was doing bad and was working towards a new goal!\n\nThe ending did kind of take away a bit of the amazingness of the movie, I mean did they really need to give Yolandi a new body as well? I think that the movie would've had a better ending if they just stopped at her burial, and didn't reveal the backup USB stick..", "Let me start this by saying that I am a massive fan of Neill's work all the way back to his short films. District 9 is actually my favourite movie of all time. Elysium was a bit disappointing but still a great film for me. I went into Chappie expecting something good but not great and I came out very happy with the film. It wasn't great but it was really good. Sharlto Copley as per usual is fantastic, Ninja and Yolandi were good, and Dev Patel was great. Hugh Jackman was rather interesting to see as a villain but he didn't seem that different from his usual self. The effects for the movie were great as per usual with Neill and I found the writing to be really well done. The advertising was a little bit on the misleading side as to what the story was really about but I don't feel that it took away from the movie for me. I will definitely be picking this movie up on Blu Ray (or 4K if I buy that damn Sony media player before it comes out) and watch it a few more times. Might go with a few friends to see it again. It was a really good movie that wasn't as great as Neill's previous work but it was nice to see him expanding upon another one of his short films. 78/100\n\nAlso would like to mention, if you can see it in IMAX, take that option. Action scenes looked fantastic on the big screen.", "IMDB's score it at a 7.4 which is a much more fair than RTs 30%.

He gets kidnapped and robbed of the robot and yet he goes back and helps the kidnappers two times rather than calling the police or telling his boss. At one point Hugh Jackman's character pulls a gun on Dev Patel's in an office setting and he is not fired or reprimanded at all. Sigorney weaver's character is the CEO of the robot company but refuses to try Artifical intelligence or spend more money on Hugh Jackman's giant robot.

It should have been purely Sci-Fi Comedy without all of the poorly written bad guys and corporate honchos (sorry Ms. Weaver, you didn't have much to work with).", "I loved this movie. I felt the feels a couple times, I loved Ninja & Yolandi, and I seriously do not understand the hate.", "I liked it a lot. I thought it was more D9 Blomkamp than Elysium Blomkamp. Seriously don't get the vicious reaction from critics tearing into this like it's a disaster. It's not. Chappie is a wonderful character.

Like seriously, I am so confused if I saw something else because 20% on RT?!\n", "I don't know if I missed it but the only people the robots were suppressing were drug dealers and criminals, and chappie was *reprogrammed not to fight against police but other drug dealers. the synopsis I read about chappie being used by fed up law abiding citizens to fight back against the government wasn't real\n\n*edit iphone", "I'll go ahead and say it.

", "I absolutely loved the first quarter or so of Chappie. It was interesting and there was emotional attachment to Chappie from the second he came alive. I was engrossed, wondering what was going to influence him next, how he would react to his environment. But that wonder only lasted so long before I realize it ISN'T going to get more interesting. \n\nThat fucking bot learned English in like a day, but never matured past the mental age of a teenager. The characters started out interesting but quickly molded into either their cliche cutouts, or something that tries to hard to be different and ends up nonsensical. Hugh Jackman, the bully that believes in brawn over brain. Dev Patel, the moral compass, who ends up having no problem at all with living forever and bringing mommy back to life. Fucking Ninja, the dumb gangster that shouldn't have even been cast in my opinion.   \n\nThe concepts in this movie are gold, and Neil tried to cram all of them into one movie, the result was that the ideas were very shallow and only skimmed the surface of each one. I can't place my finger on the point of the film; was it about consciousness? The role of automated systems in Police force? The morality of robots having AI and people becoming immortal? I don't fucking know, because it was all over the place. \n\nTowards the end it seemed to rely on special effects quite a bit. Then there is the slow motion, dramatic, pivotal shot that determines whether a character lives or dies every fucking two minutes in the action scene. A giant death bot about to give the Die Antwoord token a hydraulic pincer haircut I've been waiting for all film? Immediately switch to dramatic slow motion, trying to make it seem like the viewer is supposed to give a shit that he's over with. Turns out, nope. After a few more slow motion scenes, they kill off one of the few characters that we actually care about. \n\nOne trainwreck of disappointments later, the final decision of whether Chappie or Deon gets the new body is made pointless and kills all hope for this movie to have a meaningful ending, when Deon realizes that they have a surplus of spent robot corpses to slip their consciousness into. \n\nNothing goes wrong, there are no consequences or skeptical thinking on the fact that Deon is now going to live forever with his only companions being an angsty robot, and a mentally deficient thug who is arguably the cause of most of the conflict. But wait, there is one more character. Oh yes, the biggest nail in the coffin of Chappie. That motherfucker decides he should resurrect mommy, ripping her soul out of what he supposedly understands as the peaceful place beyond, and damn her to spend the rest of eternity as a robot. Neil, what the fuck have you done?\n\nTLDR: I enjoyed the fuck out of a few parts. Overall kind of disappointing. Still love it.", "\t\nSaw it tonight. Almost didn't go due to the reviews.  I'm glad I did. I liked it and Die Antwoord weren't bad in it. I liked Chappie's maturation, and the motion capture was astounding. You really start to feel for Chappie, especially when Ninja 'shows' him how the world is for the first time. I did get the sense that he was alive, and had feelings.  I also liked Yolandi's maternal figure. It didn't drag at all, and had nice touches of humor. Deon should have had his own office, and any one of the big tech companies would have loved his AI work. Sigorney Weaver was only there to say 'no' to Deon and Hugh Jackman. Jackman didn't get much development and his motivations don't make much sense- I'm sure the Americans or Chinese would have loved his work. If i was Deon, I would have ran to human resources after he pulled the gun on me.\n\n I thought it raised some interesting questions about the nature of consciousness. Is it still him or is it a copy? Unfortunately, the movie neither really acknowledges or answers them in a satisfying way. Chappie just figures it out with no further explaination. A hospital also would have solved a certain character's problem, and I thought Chappie was too quick to jump to his solution. \n\nIt certainly wasn't the best movie in the world, but it was entertaining and I didn't feel it was a waste of money and I really enjoyed it.  The parts with Chappie really shine and recommend it based on that, but there are other holes that keep this from being great. Another pass at the script may have solved those problems. \n", "It was incredible. Better than district 9    \n    \nSo now that I'm back I thought I would share my thoughts a little bit further. Maybe better than D9 was an overstatement. But I definitely thought this was better than Elysium. I feel like I watched a different movie than other people. I thought the characters all had very clear motives, and did things to push those motives forward. I thought that the entire concept was brilliant. So downvote away my opinion.", "I hope Blomkamp stops writing his movies", "OK so I love the movie. Having read so many of the negative reviews I wasn't sure if I would even like it. Die Antwoord did much better than I was expecting. The movie didn't feel disjointed to me. I didn't mind going from comedic to dramatic to action life some reviewers. And the look + feel of the whole thing was great.\n\nThe ending in a bit indifferent about. Kind of would haveliked it to end a few minutes earlier like maybe Dion lives but Chappie doesn't. It was a strange mix of happy and sad which is unusual.", "What a great movie, the rollerocaster of emotions and the constant body language and the fucking sniffing of chappie as if he was doing coke for years got to me.

Fuck the critics, Most of them are old snobs.\n\ngreat movie a 10/10 for me.", "This movie is not about saving the world or humanity, nor is it about a\nrobot learning moral principles from a TV. It's more about what it is\nto be a conscious being among humans when one is not human itself. \n\nBlomkamp does an amazing job developing his characters and it's hard to\nnot feel compassion for Chappie as he is dropped into the most unlikely\nplace to grow up. He goes from being an uncertain child to a relatable\nhero, capable of making the tough, but right choice in face of danger.\n\nI think it is getting many bad reviews because many of the synopses and\ntrailers that are used to market this movie make it look like a classic\nrunning-away-from-the-bad-villain-until-facing-him-in-the-end movie,\nbut it's misleading. Instead you get deep subjects like existentialism,\ngreed, vanity and fear which are mixed with entertaining and funny\ngangsterism and that really makes this movie.\n\nI gave this movie 10 out of 10, because this movie made me feel, think\nand laugh - it entertained me for the buck.", "This movie was entertaining, despite the criticism. I have seen much worse and I personally recommend anyone on the fence about seeing it this weekend who might be deterred by the comments to give it a chance (if you liked District 9 and...I guess tolerated Elysium). I personally knew nothing about Die Antwood going in, thought they were passable actors. Expect Blomkamp's signature third act of gratuitous violence that begins to lose context. \n\nI agree with other posters who say: the director has a lot to say, just doesn't know exactly how to say it. Watch it for the character of Chappie alone. Certainly the best part. \n\nFor anyone who saw the movie and knows anything about computers: worth a chuckle. Dev Patel apparently has his company's proprietary software on his laptop, along with direct wireless access to the company's production line. Chappie rigs together four PS4s into a system that can process digitized consciousness.  Also you're allowed to check out the special key dongle for as long as you want basically. None of this distracts too much from the movie though, just found it amusing. ", "Just wanted to throw out my 2\u00a2. I saw Chappie a few hours ago and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I laughed incredibly hard at most everything Chappie did, thought the vfx were amazing and actually enjoyed the story itself. A lot of the bad reviews bash Hugh Jackman and sigourney weavers characters for being one note bad guys, I guess I can understand that with Hugh Jackman but not so much sigourney as she's only in the movie for a total of like 10 minutes and doesn't really do much. She's just a character with no real moral standing good or evil. The acting got kinda sub par from Ninja and Yo-Lani but what's to really be expected from two south African musicians who to my knowledge haven't acted before. Their performance never really detracted from my enjoyment. Except for ninja being a dick most of the film. I don't get the hate, the movie has been made out by many to basically be a shit fest but that's not what I saw at all. I hope it does well financially and hopefully the good reviews start coming in because I think Neil Blomkamp and company earned it. 8/10", "I doubt this will ever be seen, but this is my interpretation of CHAPPiE:\n\nTo be honest, I think people and critics don't like the movie because they missed some of the symbolism portrayed in the movie. There is a lot of Christian mythology in it. (Note: I am not Christian, but I am some what familiar with the story of Christ and the relationship between the Christian God and man. Forgive me if I  misinterpret some of the Christian archetypes.) It should also noted that while having Christian symbolism and archetypes, I think that the movie is also a little bit critical of religion. I'll explain why. \n\nFirst we have Deon. He can be seen as God type figure. He is the creator of Chappie and fits the role of \"God\" very well. He creates life and takes very little responsibility for it. He doesn't interact with Chappie very much in the movie. You may think that this is a plot hole but if you associate him with God it makes a lot more sense. He leaves Chappie, leaving him very little to help guide him. He gives him a book. This can be seen as a \"bible\" or be seen as knowledge. He also demands that Chappie respect him as his creator, even though he has done very little to impact his life. He is even resurrected. The scene where Chappie is angry at Deon because of his battery, he asks Deon, \"Why would you create me in order to die?\" You can clearly see the symbolism of a man asking God the meaning of life. Why are we created only to die.  \n\nVincent is an interesting character. Again, I am only a little bit familiar with the Christan religion so I am having trouble fitting him in the mythology. Vincent is Christian. If you notice, he does wear a crucifix. He even invites Deon to church with him. The disturbing part I think, is when he does the sign of the cross on his chest (I don't know what it is called) just before controlling a death machine and murdering a bunch of people all while laughing the whole time. He does the same sign when he sees that Chappie is in deed sentient. This is where I think that the movie is a little bit critical of religion. \n\nWhile I think that there are some political overtones in the movie, I think that there are far more religious overtones. I think that the critics have completely misunderstood this move. I hear that the biggest complaint was the charters Yolandi, Ninja, and America. I think these Charters are also misunderstood. They all had redeeming qualities to them. Yes, they were thieves and bad people, but they were a product of their environment. If you notice, the only reason they wanted to get money was so that they could leave their situation. It's just that it snowballed into a bigger problem for them. Ninja at the end was willing to sacrifice himself for Yolandi and she was willing to do the same for him. Yolandi was also nurturing to Chappie and taught him some really nice things. Even Ninja took the time to teach Chappie how life and death worked in this world. They were more complex then people give them credit for.  \n\nThis movie is far more complex than people realize. I think the ones that gave it a bad review may not have understood it.\n\nI loved the movie. \"Dem feels\". I have to admit, I teared up during the \"Beating\" scene. I lost it when Chappie said, \"I'm afraid, let me back in the car America!\" \"I want to go home!\"  It was hard to watch. The director did an excellent job, forcing me to feel for a robot. This movie shows the cruelty man is capable of. I hope people will give Chappie another chance.  ", "The characters are dumb as hell. Chappie was the only likable thing about the whole movie. I couldn't take ninja and his gang as serious gangsters because they acted henchmen. What was up the with the subtitles for the one gangster the muscles and dreadlocks? I had more trouble understanding ninja. Also, what is with lower case i's in titles? Was this movie made by Apple? The movie was basically a die antwoord music video. ", "Things that struck me with this movie:\n\n1. The amount of emotion shown with led \"eyes\", and a single bar \" eyebrow\"... Combined with dog ear like antennas. Fucking amazing job.\n\n2. CHAPPiE had more character development than most movies in a year combined have. In the inevitable comparison to Johnny 5 - J5 is a goofy robot that talks. CHAPPiE is a living being with real emotions that you feel for.\n\n3. The scouts weren't evil, nor were the police. They rejected the robot that would have given them absolute control. The only people happy when the scouts went down were gangsters, so I don't get the whole oppressive police angle description.\n\n4. CHAPPiE looked real as shit, made me wonder if he was a puppet during interactions with live people.\n\n5. I love the look of his films, and love seeing his Nissan pop up.\n\n6. This is a great popcorn flick with a healthy dose of emotion and feeling. The action is top notch and doesn't disappoint.\n\n7 TL;DR - I FUCKING LOVED IT.", "This thread is a perfect example of the reddit \"Hivemind\".

I thought it had some good funny moments and the action was great. Hugh Jackman and Dev Patel were both good in their parts and Sharlto Copley was amazing as Chappie. However, the movie has flaws such as the gangster aspect of the film not working with the rest if it and the ending I found was quite strange given what the movie had said about consienceness up till that point. However I would still rate the movie a solid 7/10 and will be picking it up to sit next to my blurays of district 9 and Elysium.", "Damn... this movie is getting brutalized and doesn't deserve it. It is far better than Elysium because it actually has some character! The Chappie character is great. The film has flaws, lots of them, but Sharlto carries the film quite a bit and there are great moments. This movie does not deserve to be sharing ratings close to piece of shit Transformers movies. People are just engaging in a feeding frenzy because Blomkamp attained so much respect so quickly and now 'the downfall continues after Elysium'... but this movie is better even with its flaws... I'd give it a 60%, it has flaws but is a decent effort and has many interesting aspects.  ", "Just got back from watching it.\n\nI thought it was a solid film, with plenty of heart and a lot of surprisingly sweet moments.\n\nIt's basically Robocop in reverse, crossed with Short Circuit 2, but it works. It's not masterpiece certainly, and the product placement was a little distracting, but it's entertaining as hell.\n\nI will say I went in totally blind, only knowing that it was something to do with a robot that is given AI. I knew Sigourney Weaver was in it and that's it. I had no preconceptions about the film and enjoyed it immensely. \n\nAlso, I have no idea what a Die Anderwoord is (or however you spell it).

Now, this discussion is with spoilers, and lemme say that im about to address a few. Let's talk about the ending, Chappie and friends get to get new bodies while keeping their conciseness. A lot of people thought this ending sucked, and I kind of agree. It could have been such s better movie if it was more dramatic, if the only two main characters were Chappie and the Indian guy. If the whole movie was trying to figure out who we are and what we are. \n\nInstead when t he film asks the question, it's answer is an action scene. This shouldn't have been an action movie. I'm very worried about Alien, now. ", "This is the third thread I have defended this movie in. It was a very good movie, better than Elysium, maybe not as impactful as district 9. Anyone at all interested in original scifi should see it. I am dumbfounded by the bad reviews.", "It certainly won't be the best film I will see this year but I did enjoy watching it and exploring the possibility of the future where artificial intelligence gets to this level.", "Just saw it and loved it. Especially compared to Elysium, which was just sterile, boring bullshit. Chappie was both both bonkers (what else would you expect from a movie with Die Antwoord in it), entertaining and sweet at the same time.\nI'm really at loss as to what movie everyone on RT saw.", "A lot of people are commenting how the movie seemed like an extended music video or big advertisement for Die Antwoord, with some people even theorizing that Blonkamp knowingly made some sort of inspired meta comment with their casting.\n\nI think that the whole persona of Die Atwoord is basically the concept of wearing their quirky inner world on their skin. Just as the movie Rango eerily seemed to be like opening up Johnny Depp's head and peering into the bizarre and fantastical world inside, I think they did the same thing with their band as they--in a sense--*visualized* their inner consciousness and visibly *wore it* and shared it in way that became a sort of shared collective consciousness experience. So in a way, I think you can see the immediate meta transfer of this concept into the big theme in Chappie of consciousness itself, and of visualizing it and sharing or disseminating it as a means of freeing yourself from limitations. \n\nI think this is also where the bizarre, seemingly underutilized theme of Chappie being a kind of \"revolution\" of sorts comes in--something that was especially hinted in the trailers but didn't seem that overtly present in the movie. Hugh Jackman's character and machine--his inner vision--was based on control, of wearing that helmet and seeing only his perspective. Chappie's \"solved equation of consciousness\" had more to do with his vision of consciousness as a means of freedom, with the helmet used as a means of breaking through the limitation of death itself (his constant proclamation throughout the film of his invulnerability--which is referring of course, to the invulnerability of the spirit). Chappie himself was borne as a sort of aberration of freedom, as a \"black sheep\" that is unique and sentient amid his brethren and will (assumedly) later spread to free many other machines like him--the last shot of the film, is of the \"mother\" Yolanda being reconstructed at a mass-manufacturing plant, symbolically giving birth to a new form of spreading consciousness.\n\nNow, to take the *meta* to a \"whole other level\" you can also look at Hugh Jackman's entire filmography and see similarities to his entire career and this film. He's done similar films with robots and of fighting them directly or indirectly like Days of Future Past or Real Steel. He's very often done roles as a kind of prisoner fighting against fate or unbreakable limitations, as in Les Miserables with his robotic prisoner identity 24601 eventually changing to a freed man in spirit in Jean Valjean, or The Fountain as someone struggling with the concept of death itself, and in trying to find the cure to it (something very similar to Chappie), or even the movie Prisoners which states it in its title. The other X-men movies have him grappling with this unbreakable, invincible core inside him and the search for identity and belonging, especially in his quest to discover the creation of himself (which was somewhat forced) and in remembering who he is. In Van Helsing he had to remember that he is essentially the arch-angel Gabriel, yet another example of invulnerability presented as an immortal being in a human shell. Even something like The Prestige has a kind of similar correlation to his character in Chappie, of exact copies or duplicates of himself being another kind of prison of control, as compared to Chappie's *solved* vision and Die Antwoord's whole persona (that took a life of its own and grew beyond anything they ever thought it would be) in the film, of your shared inner world as a means of liberation and freedom and in a sense, of immortality: in the continued act of the creation of your own self; creation in your own image eventually taking a life of its own and growing beyond anything you could have envisioned, just as Chappie's own maker tells him.

It consisted of WAY too many jump scares, as if they got the idea somehow that just having a bunch of jump scares is what makes it a scary movie. They were almost all very predictable, all very annoying, and they all majorly detracted from the experience as they just ended up being loud and obnoxious. The movie also seemed as though it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a Sci-fi horror or a religious one, fluctuating wildly between the two and only resulting in my disappointment at how they seemingly only added that aspect in so it would be \"open to interpretation\". The problem was that it seemed really forced, which is not a tactful way to go about doing that, and is not a good sign for the writing of the movie. The only redeeming factor for me was that the science they used was surprisingly accurate, though I expected nothing less from an actor that spent a lot of time on House, on a medical TV show that is also incredibly accurate. The acting was all great and I still think the actors are great. The movie was brought down by the jump scares and the writing that never lived up to what a great potential it had.", "I liked it...", "Is this worth a watch?

We the audience are assuming that she heard peoples thoughts but at the same time if you are hypersensitive and developing higher cognitive abilities how easy could it be to reasonably predict the next thing people are going to say to you much less the ones you have been working with for years? And who is to say that the all the voices she was hearing weren't some of her own thoughts being projected? Remember that she had an episode in the bathroom regarding her hands that ultimately was not really there?\n\nI think her mind repairing the tissues in her brain re-hashed her guilt and memory, the serum being so effective at evolving her body ultimately cause her to originally subconsciously manifest her fears and guilt until they completely manifested and took over her body, and then when she finally decided to go balls to walls and literally take the whole bag of serum to the dome, she was finally able to materialize her manifestations into the real world. \n\nThis is all good, but in the end who is to say that any of that happened?

It's just really blatant, obvious movie magic, and didn't one time make me believe the character is really capable of any of that.

The onscreen bumping and grinding is actually quite tame \u2013 there\u2019s more chemistry in a high school science classroom than there is between the two leads, and there are better sex scenes on just about any HBO series than anything you\u2019ll find during this film\u2019s 125-minute running time.\n\nThe length is yet another entry on a long list of sins committed by Fifty Shades of Grey, because there\u2019s scarcely enough material here to fill an hour, let alone two. Once the subject of the contract has been introduced, the remainder of the film is a repetition of scenes: Grey tries to get Ana to sign the contract, thus becoming the submissive to his dominant, and Ana tries to get Grey to commit to a more traditional relationship, where they can sleep in the same bed and she\u2019s allowed to look at him and touch him without asking permission. Watching this same scenario play out again and again without any hint of plot advancement or character development quickly becomes exhausting.\n\nJamie Dornan is woefully miscast here in the role of the charming billionaire. The Irish-born actor spends most of the film grappling with an American accent, which causes the poorly written dialogue to sounds even more unnatural, and he lacks the confidence or charisma needed to make this sort of character compelling. Dornan never seems comfortable in the role \u2013 perhaps because he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the subject matter, a point he\u2019s mentioned during the film\u2019s press tour \u2013 and his performance suffers because of it.\n\nDakota Johnson, on the other hand, is one of the few things that Fifty Shades of Grey gets right.

We believe that she\u2019s truly attracted to Grey, we just never really understand why. In fact, there\u2019s a lot of confusion on both sides of that equation \u2013 why would either of these people be so insistent on trying to be with someone they\u2019re clearly not compatible with?\n\nAt one point, Ana berates Grey for being unwilling to accept her the way that she is, while simultaneously pressuring him to conform to her own standards. Grey, meanwhile, is well aware that Ana is reluctant to become his submissive, and spends the second half of the film trying to persuade her to accept his offer, while repeatedly telling her that she\u2019s perfect the way she is. Each wants the other to change, and neither is willing to, so the whole thing just feels like an exercise in futility.\n\nCome to think of it, that\u2019s a perfect allegory for the film as a whole. Fifty Shades of Grey desperately wants us to believe that the characters onscreen are genuine (they\u2019re not), that their chemistry is palpable (it isn\u2019t), and that the sex scenes are scandalous and taboo (they\u2019re not).

I do warn all my readers that I have not read the book, so don\u2019t shoot me for liking or not liking something in the movie that was or wasn\u2019t in the book. But after all that here are my 10 takeaways from seeing Fifty Shades of Grey.\n\n1 \u2013 I really feel they missed the boat on the casting of Christian. While I had never ready the books I have heard a lot about them and heard a bunch about this \u201cChristian\u201d guy. He is this hot-shot rich guy that just woman grovel over, well this guy didn\u2019t do that for me.\n\n2 \u2013 I was fond of the Dakota Johnson casting though. While she wasn\u2019t overly drop dead gorgeous, she fit the role of innocent girl Anastasia. I looked at her IMDB page and really didn\u2019t know she was in as many movies as it stated but this was her first \u201cbig time\u201d role in a movie. I would also like to applaud her for having the \u201cballs\u201d to be naked for like 75% of the film.\n\n3 \u2013 Seattle is a beautiful city.\n\n4 \u2013 The rest of the cast really didn\u2019t matter. It was all about Christian and Anastasia. This was a key to me in making this movie enjoyable. I didn\u2019t have to buy into the other characters, they were selling me on the focal points of the story and I enjoyed that.\n\n5 \u2013 You can\u2019t help but laugh at certain parts of the movie. Certain things about the movie were funny to me. I had no problem with the contract of confidentially but the sex contract really made me laugh.\n\n6 \u2013 The scene where Anastasia dissects Christians contract in this very low lite room, HOW COULD THEY SEE WHAT WAS ON THE PAPER? It was way too dark in that room to see any lighting at all. (Side note: I do love how Anastasia worked up Christian in this scene, just to walk out on him.\n\n7 \u2013 Chemistry between Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan was pretty good. You felt it from there first scene and throughout the movie. They worked well together. This is very vital in a movie based on the two main characters.\n\n8 \u2013 Placement of the music/the score was fantastic. They used the songs at the perfect time, I loved the change they brought to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Crazy in Love mix they had in the film. It was a harder version of the song that really fit perfect in the film.\n\n9 \u2013 A lot less sex in the movie than I thought which really shocked me. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect but I thought for sure there would be more than what happened in the movie.\n\n10 \u2013 The movie for me was all about building the background story for Christian and Anastasia. It was a decent build and my first thought walking out of the theater was they set this whole thing up to make the 2nd one. I know there are 3 books and that\u2019s the purpose but as a person never reading the books I knew as soon as it ended, another was to follow.\n\nOverall Review\n\n3 out of 5 Stars \n\nThis will never go down as a great movie but it was very enjoyable. While at times I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at certain things, I couldn\u2019t help but find myself invested in the main characters. It was a well-directed, well shot and the score was fantastic. I bought into the movie and that to me is a big reason I liked it.\n\n", "It's not by much, but this was actually a bit better than I expected. There's a lot I hate about it but while I was watching it, I was entertained (which is all I want from a movie). I definitely don't recommend seeing it in cinemas, just wait and rent it. It doesn't require immediate attendance. ", "I didn't get a single boner. 3/10.\n\nI struggle to see who this movie is going to please beyond repressed housewives who find traditional porn too \"icky\" and just want a sensual experience with some nice chiseled bodies. To anyone raised in the instant gratification world of internet porn, it's just too tame.\n\nI checked my watch when the first sex scene started. 43 minutes, which is far too long for a film already running at least 25-30 minutes too long. There's only about 15-20 minutes of nudity/sex in the whole film, and it's all incredibly softcore. Just tits and ass, some pubic hair, but every time it's about to show the goods, the shot obnoxiously cuts away. There's ONE shot where you see about half an inch of Grey's cock as he's unbuttoning his boxers, but it's blink and you'll miss it. I say this as a straight man: the film needed more cock if it really wanted to leave people satisfied. Also despite Grey saying \"I don't make love, I fuck\", the sex that's shown is incredibly cheesy, slow sex with low lighting. Nothing at all visceral here. I wanted to see Grey shoving his face in her snatch and vigorously eating her out with some passion. None of that here. And the BDSM doesn't even really get properly introduced until the last 30 or so minutes, and most of the things they talk about doing aren't even shown.\n\nDakota Johnson and Seamus McGarvey (cinematographer) are the MVPs  here. There's a subtle snark to Johnson's performance that suggests she's in on the joke, even though she's also genuinely believable as this little girl lost. Dornan is pretty bland on the other hand, and every time a girl said \"omg he's so hot\" in the film I had to roll my eyes, as it felt like the filmmakers were trying to convince us. It goes without saying that the dialogue is largely awful, but occasionally it does raise a few intended giggles.\n\nThen there's the representation of BDSM. Couldn't Grey just have been this badass business magnate who takes out his frustrations with kinky sex? Instead he has to be this damaged creep who stalks Anastasia and acts like a controlling asshole. Also the pop psychology was incredibly lazy; so he was abused as a youngster and thus seeks to take control of his own sexual destiny. Alright, got it.\n\nAnd the ending was balls. Given that the movie seems like it wants to promote BDSM to begin with, it ends on an unsettling note that's completely the opposite. I don't get it. And don't give me the \"that's how the book ended\" crap. A movie needs to stand on its own, and this ending blew.\n\nAlso, if there's a worse line of dialogue than \"Laters baby\" this year, I would be amazed.", " It was bad but not the worst thing ever. I saw a preview of the movie and it was okay, not bad but not good. I know most people want to savage the film, but it isn't horrible. It had a better love story than Jupiter Ascending and funnier than Mortecai. The movie was enjoyable due to the humor of Dakota Johnson. She is funny in it to bounce off the seriousness of Mr.Grey and the script. the sex scenes were tame considering what was expected and quite dull. I get that this movie is based of Twilight Fan fiction but it was better than the low expectations everyone is giving it.

I laughed a lot, but 99% of the time, I was laughing *with* the film rather than *at* it.\n\nDakota Johnson is pretty good. Dornan, on the other hand, is not great at all. Kelly Marcel, the screenwriter, struggles nimbly with the terrible dialogue of the book and, for the most part, manages to make it tolerable.\n\nThe whole thing goes to show that, even if you can't polish a turd, you can at least air out the smell.", "I actually like it a lot. I haven't read the book though and people in the theater were mad about the ending. That belt seen was some heavy stuff. ", "Just got out of the cinema. The movie was better than my worst expectations.

I read the book and they cut out a few characters, and the story seemed super choppy.  I noticed most of the theater was middle aged women sprinkled with a few groups of college girls.

The only conflict in the movie (whatever Grey's secret is) is never resolved or explored. \n\nJamie Dornan is unwatchable. The excuse of \"well, that's the character\" is stupid. It was empty and clunky. It seemed like he didn't understand most of his lines, or even his motivations. \n\nDakota Johnson is likeable, but that's more a testament to her than anything else. This seems like that kind of movie that lives or dies with the chemistry between the two characters, but it doesn't seem to exist.

For example at the end where the entire population were fighting we had people beating each other up and it was meant to be a bit silly, but then we had a scene where Eggy's mum is going all \"The Shining\" on her daughter and trying to kill her, then it jumps to funny again and back to the the mum. I didn't know how to feel, should I have been laughing or shocked??\n\nOther areas of the movie suffered similar foibles where the movie lacked identify, it started off, probably for the first hour, being quite serious in the exposition and a little slow and dull.

If the cg animation that was shown in the trailers is the only thing stopping you from seeing this, it's such a small part of the movie and definitely the weakest part, the traditional animation takes up most of it and it's great. I do think the first movie was better, feeling more like an actual cinematic story, whereas this feels like a long episode of the tv show, which isn't really the seal of quality it used to be. \n\nOverall, I'd have to give this movie a 7/10.

Not a major Spongebob fan, this was almost like a \"Greatest Hits\" type of movie because the plot is sprinkled with so many references to famous Spongebob episodes. The 2D Animation is just a regular episode elevated to movie level. There's a lot more self-aware jokes that make it fun to watch and would be better for older Spongebob fans. It isn't that surprising until they involve Time Travel and more extraordinary elements. It's funny, but plenty of jokes fall flat.\n\nI actually think the live action scenes are the best. Antonio Banderas is great as BurgerBeard because he's fun and actually pretty clever at being a villain and physical comedian.

And that's not a bad thing, I know it's a kids movie and the jokes are written for kids, but maybe I've just been spoiled by kids movies like Toy Story and The Lego Movie that are just as much for adults as they are for kids.  \nAnd I was really looking forward to the 3D animated stuff, but that was barely even in the movie.  \nThe only part I actually enjoyed was the dolphin character.

The movie felt like studio executives trying to make money, instead of them paying homage to the franchise.", "When the movie is in the original 2D animation format it works really well. When they go out of water to cgi it is really not good. I would say that the parts under water were made for the old fans who watched the show in the early years; while the cgi parts were made for the newer fans and younger kids. It was great to see the old style of humor come back in the first two acts of the movie, but the rest is easily forgettable.", "I LOVED the first film and it was one of my favorite movie going memories ever just because of how much fun I had. \n\nAfter seeing the film, I was surprised it was as well-reviewed as it was. The Burger Beard parts with the seagulls were cringeworthy, and overtime I started to enjoy the movie a bit more, they'd pop back up again and just strike that down. It might be arbitrary, but those damned live-action sequences are the reason I can't whole-heartedly recommend this film to anyone else. Without those, I feel like it could have been a bit more enjoyable, but those scenes make it abundantly clear the film caters much more to its younger audience as opposed to those who were young when it started.\n\nI mean, if you have kids, definitely go and see it.

There are a lot of times where it starts to seem interesting, but then it takes it into some weird direction and you can't help but question why they would go there.\n\nThe Dolphin Illuminati stuff really didn't do anything for me. They wouldn't let it go, which just baffles me considering how confusing it was. The entire time I thought I was missing some sort of joke or reference that I didn't know about.

The pirate singing with the birds would have been an excellent ending, then they have to go and interrupt it with a random reference to a series of YouTube videos.

I was not going in thinking this was going to be the first movie or better, I went in just hoping for a decent SpongeBob movie.\n\nI got none of that, the beginning wasn't so bad, they had me on board for a bit but when it was SpongeBob and plankton for basically half the movie the random shit started happening.  Like building a time machine out of a photo booth at a Taco place I have never seen in a SpongeBob episode, also the whole time travel thing ends up being pointless because it accomplishes nothing.\n\nAfter that I mean it just goes downhill, no stability whatsoever just random jokes that land few and far between.  There's almost no congruent story which is what a SpongeBob movie needs. I mean what in the hell was that cosmic dolphin, I couldn't bear to listen to that thing talk.  I understand it's a children's movie but there was nothing to salvage I mean yea there was a quick reference to the shining but nowhere near the magic that I though Hillenburg could've brought back.\n\nAll in all it felt like a bunch of random SpongeBob happenings that could've came out as a DVD movie and alot of it was almost cringe worthy.

A lot of reviewers were hyping it up to be as good as the older seasons, and while it was much better than the drivel that is the new episodes, it just rehashed much of the jokes, and had some very laugh dry spots, as well as just being very strange. \n\nCan't really comment on the plot, because that would mean that it had one in the first place. The movie basically consisted of unused episode ideas randomly thrown together, leaving the feel of a tv movie/special instead of a theatrical film, like the first. \n\nHowever, the animation was still top notch, and the time travel sequences made it well worth the extra $ for 3D.\n\nOverall, I'd probably give it a 6/10, for at least giving me a few laughs", "Quick question for anyone that's also seen Jupiter Ascending.  Is this movie really that much better?", "Not gonna lie I kind of hated this. I loved the old Spongebob and this is not a revitalization of that like I hoped it would be.

This is a disservice to the childhood memories of 90s kids.

No innuendoes, no in-jokes, (I guess the illuminati, but I didn't even notice that one), no Hillenburg dry humor, basically no fan service at all. None of the good things about Spongebob are in here at all. I was determined to see it, I was curious to see if new Spongebob has any respect for his former self. Nope. At this point, Spongebob is best compared to the once amazing athlete who had a horrible accident and ended up wallowing in a constant state of depression and drug use. Yes, it's that bad. Literally the only upside to me seeing this movie is so I can warn my friends not to. RIP Spongebob, you may not be dead when it comes to the bigwigs at Nickelodeon, but everything that made you funny back in 1999 has long since disappeared. This abomination I witnessed today wasn't you, you've become a shell of your former self. I did not enjoy this movie at all. OK, superhero movies are justifiably popular, I love them, but Spongebob didn't have to be one. Why they didn't use the original superheroes from that episode, I don't know. The Quickster, Captain Magma, c'mon! That would have been an amazing throwback and fan service for older fans. But no, they had to go with Mr. Superawesomeness? Everything about the movie was lazy. They probably spent upwards of a million on the live action/CGI and Antonio Banderas when they could've kept it traditional like the first one and written a better script. I don't remember a single joke that made me laugh. Yes, there was Findland, there was talking fish head, there was Leg Dude. Those made me smile, think back to when I was ten. I know getting this worked up over what is essentially a children's movie might be weird, but I was totally under the impression Hillenberg would write the script. I was hyped, I thought the best cartoon from my childhood was back. I just came out really disappointed. I was hoping \"first three seasons\" and what I got was nothing like that. I know a lot of people saw it high and enjoyed it. I didn't, and I didn't. You never had to watch Spongebob high to enjoy it until after Hillenburg left. Rant over. I sound like an old depressed stick in the mud, I assure you I'm not. ", "Great movie. *Arguably* better than the first. Lots of good jokes, the land scenes look great, but comedically dont impress.

I sincerely hope it doesn't stop the Wachowskis from getting big budgets, even though it'd be hard to blame studios for refusing to bankroll them after so many expensive flops in a row. I'm just fascinated this movie got made at all.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Mila Kunis was a likeable lead.\n\n- CGI/cinematography is top notch. I never felt like the CGI was blurry even when there was a lot of movement, and you could always tell what was going on\n\n- The first act made me initially think the critics kinda had it wrong. Yes, the dialogue was still shitty, but it moved fast and the action was thrilling.\n\n- The chase sequence through Chicago was excellent. I almost feel like Warner, who surely were tracking the film to bomb, should have just released this 7-8 minute clip online a few weeks ago as it might've pulled some more casual audiences in.\n\n- I accidentally showed up for a 3D screening but the 3D was actually pretty good, especially during the final battle. Lots of wide shots conveying the scale. Shame there were so many talky scenes as well though that made no use of it because it was just shot-reverse-shot.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Relentless exposition that would make Christopher Nolan cringe. No subtlety whatsoever, and scenes drag on for minutes at a time telling rather than showing. \n\n- The pacing. The first act is a cracker, but then it grinds to a halt for like 30 minutes where there's no action and just relentless dialogue. One character even says to Tatum, \"the pacing isn't helping\", which made me cackle out loud.\n\n- Similarly the editing in this regard was all over the place. Like when [Spoilers](#s \"Tatum runs out of oxygen, the scene efficiently cuts away to save wasting screen time of him getting in the ship\"), but then so many of the overly verbose dialogues could have been cut way down too\n\n- Eddie Redmayne. Holy shitballs, I'd heard things about his performance and thought it was gonna be overstated, but he really is terrible. He sounds like a lung cancer patient for most of the movie except when he goes full Retard Gary Oldman and starts screaming. I figured once he rejuvenated for the first time he might actually sound like a human being. I could barely concentrate on his dialogue when he was talking.\n\n- The guy who played Titus looks like a Team America puppet. Every film I've seen him in I've thought this. Nothing behind the eyes.\n\n- Underdeveloped supporting characters. Doona Bae's character and numerous others appear for a few minutes and I can't even name them.\n\n- Doona Bae's character is very clearly an eye-rolling attempt for Lana Wachowski to model a character off herself and force it into the movie. Just look at that hair.\n\n- The love story was just your standard crappy forced nonsense. I get why it's there, but it's just all too easy and unconvincing.\n\n- Too much recycling of plot points similar to The Matrix series - humans as a commodity to an exterior force etc.\n\n- The \"keeper\" alien things were the only crappy CGI in the movie.

I feel as if I need to see it six more times. I feel bad for the Wachowski's. I love their bold \"go big or go home\"  fantastical approach to filmmaking. I think they design some of the best action sequences, and create very vivid worlds. That being said, they should NEVER be allowed to write their own movies again without some sort of editor. My friends and I were dying with laughter with how hamfisted and bizarre some of the lines these actors had to say, as well as some of the story elements without ever really justifying any of it (the bees detect royalty?). \nEddie Redmayne is so hilariously over the top. Everyone in the theater I saw was dying of laughter during every scene he does. \nMila Kunis was completely miscast. Simple as that. \nChanning Tatum I have to get mad props to. I think he knew how ridiculous this movie was and did the best he could with what he was given. Sean Bean was very Sean Bean too.\nDialogue and bizarre story aside, this movie was very fun to watch, and though there were a few dull moments where you could tell they were delivering that Wachowski \"nothing is as it seems\" philosophy those slow parts were few and far between the spectacle of the different worlds and action sequences Jupiter Ascending had to offer. This movie feels like a lot of classic sci-fi movies slammed together. Fifth Element, Star Wars, Dune, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to name a few.\n\nIt's not a great movie by any means, and this is certainly going to be the last movie of its kind for awhile let out of a major studio. I recommend seeing it though. Especially with a group of like minded friends who can laugh at the ridiculousness of this movie.

I loved all the effects, and they were big. Totally what the big screen is for, IMO.\n\nThe concept was solid and interesting, I think, though the execution could have been stronger with a rewrite(by someone who knows how people actually talk and feel), or maybe even some better editing.

But surprisingly, her acting wasn't too horrible, considering what she was given. The \"romance\" was completely unbelievable, with no chemistry.

", "If the world ends without a Saga film, I will be very fucking happy.\n\nBut if the powers-that-be are cruel and force the hand of an adaptation, the character design, the idiosyncracies, and the flatout ambition of the Wachowskis with this movie promise me that they are the only filmmakers who could possibly do such a story justice.\n\nThat said... this movie was still sort of underwhelming.", "Spoilers/Wachowski Admirer \n\nThis film is by no means perfect.  It has a simple structure and a familiar story, that of the nobody becoming royalty and being saved by an outlaw hero to achieve their destiny.  It would appear as though it is aimed towards pleasing both boys and girls in their mid teens.  You can really see them pulling back from the graphic violence and adding humor to make it more accessible for teens who generally don't enjoy sci-fi films.  Yes the jokes often fall flat, or come from a direction we haven't seen before.\n\nHowever, in all of this there is originality and intense care to detail.  The world-building is fantastic and on a scale that far exceeds recent comparisons.  There is a strong Dune influence in the representation of family dynasties/political motivations, but the Wachowski's intense visual style differentiate it enough to keep it fresh and hint at a bigger universe.  There is a commitment to concept that has been commented on here as growing old or comical as the film progresses, but I would disagree.  You never feel as though the characters are not using all of their abilities to survive these situations.  I admire them for not revealing a 'secret weapon'.  The technology in the film is unified in look and utility.  All the ships have distinct characteristics apart from scale, but you can see mirrored concept through each grander iteration.  The cathedral-like ships are beautifully imagined, and cleverly utilized for the wedding scene.  The initial chase sequence with the hunters is a visual treat, cameras jumping underneath Caine's feet both in air and through glass.  The minion hunters are something straight out of anime and look the part.  Every time one of those massive ships bursts through some space-phenomenon it is equally breathtaking.  Costume design is great, especially for the space suits.  CGI is solid, there are some spots which are a bit shaky, but you have to give them credit for holding onto the shots as long as they do.        \n\nThe performances are all over the place.  Tatum is relatively consistent through the film, although he doesn't have a whole lot to do.  Kunis is stuck with some cringe-worthy dialogue, but as a whole carries the role and pulls off the critical moments of the film.  The final sequence with her and Redmayne is fantastic, it feels brutal and the hits sell.  Redmayne is the tricky one.  It's hard to tell whether or not there were parts cut from throughout his dialogue.  He is truly an operatic villain, chewing scenery and whispering threats.  The physicality of his performance was great though, the stiffness and mannerisms consistent throughout.  Sean Bean didn't die, and gave a solid one-note performance as an old soldier.  Wonderful cameo with Terry Gilliam, although maybe too long for what it did for the story.  \n\nI would say that the themes of the film are not delivered through the dialogue, instead being woven into the world of the film instead.  There are many themes which were explored in a less accessible way through 'Cloud Atlas' which appear in 'Jupiter Ascending' in a simplified way.  As many sci-fi films in the past, this one approaches the subject of the 'alien'.  The fact that we are all insignificant and vastly different iterations of the same genetic code would seem to be the unifying message that they want to get across.  They splice humans together with every sort of animal and tell the viewer that this is normal and acceptable, we'll see if people are more or less offended than they were with actors switching races.  Again we get the concept of reincarnation, of failing in one life and finding redemption in the next, both with Sting, Caine, Jupiter's characters.  There is some interesting woman-centered humor that I've never seen in a movie of this scale before.  You have to love the explanation for the 'traditional aliens' in this film, a little nod to conspiracy theorists.  The whole russian family dynamic, while unbalanced, is a nice, distinct, sub-world within the film. \n\nI'm not sure where I heard it, but at some point, in reference to the final sentinel scene in the third Matrix, the Wachowski's said that they were trying to create something so visually distinct that it could never be mimicked the way that bullet-time had been.  The level of spectacle that they operate at is inspiring.  From The Matrix, to Speed Racer, to Cloud Atlas, and now to Jupiter Ascending they continue to create things that nobody has seen before.  They translate dreams into fantastic visual declarations that hearken back to Gilliam's worlds.  Personally, I would rather have films which continually try to show me things I haven't seen before.  Whether they're perfect or not is irrelevant as long as they are this unique and lovingly crafted. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this film and will watch it again.

As in, more than I probably should. I have a soft spot in my heart for well designed space movies. Both this and Riddick share one drawback that keeps them from being great, however - campiness. The dialogue is campy, the sets, the costumes...but the tone is dead serious. The Wachowskis CAN do camp, I saw it dripping off the screen in Speed Racer, but they chose to avoid it here which I think will doom the film. Look at Guardians of the Galaxy. Huge scope and very much in line with space opera at times, but it keeps the camp and is better for it.", "This is one of the rare movies that the special effects and scenery make up for a very disjointed plot.

He explains them, I shit you not, as letting him \"ride differential equations\".\n* In the first half of the movie, there is a big fight scene in Chicago. About halfway through the scene, my friends and I all started looking around at each other to make sure we weren't just blazed and that this scene was really going on this long. I wasn't timing it, but I'd wager it was 10-15 minutes of straight action shots with little to no dialogue. \n* ROYALTY SENSING BEES.\n* Channing Tatum's character's whole background story is that he's spliced with wolf DNA or something and that he lost his job because he mauled someone once. They keep bringing this up as a reason not for Jupiter not to trust him. It is mentioned repeatedly. This is never relevant, and he never bites anyone in the movie, not even when he GETS INTO A FIGHT WHERE SOMEONE ELSE BITES HIM\n* Additionally, Channing Tatum spends 90% of his screen time rescuing Mila Kunis from falling. \n* Mila Kunis talked in her AMA about how Jupiter is a strong character and does a lot of her own fighting... I don't know if she watched the movie she's in, but she beats one guy with a pipe once and spends every other action scene falling so that Channing Tatum can catch her.\n* Notice that I never refer to Channing Tatum's character by his name? I can't remember it, and I saw the movie an hour ago.\n* There was one scene where an unimportant character coughs in the middle of her line. She just continues her sentence and everyone carries on. Like... why did she cough? Could they not have done another take? Was she *supposed* to cough? It didn't have any relevance, she was a one line character and she fucked it up.\n* There are a few CGI aliens in the movie. Mostly a race of dragon looking dudes with wings, who are used repeatedly throughout as henchmen by the bad guys. But there is this one tusked elephant looking alien that has about 4 seconds of total screen time. He is clearly a different type of alien than any of the other characters in the movie, he looks completely different. Yet they felt his 4 seconds of screen time important enough to devote the time and effort into modeling, animating and rendering this random unique alien!?\n\nI'm definitely leaving out a lot.

It didn't really feel claustrophobic enough and limped across the finish line with a whimper, exactly the manner I thought it would.", "I saw this at a screening last week with the director and writer and I was very disappointed. I thought it had some really bad dialog and plot points. Specifically the \"well he better have cancer\" line felt so dumb to me. The kid character was made to act so dumb it wasn't believable. And the guy who was forced to tag along kept making such stupid comments, it was killing me. But I really did love the shot with Jude Law sitting on the gold, smoking as he was about to die in the submarine, that looked really cool. the movie just felt like it missed a lot of opportunities. But afterwards the director and writer told some interesting stories about filming that made it sound like a great movie.

How did Kyle not get a royal ass chewing or reprimanded for botching the mission in the final war scene? If he truly messed up the mission that bad, why didn't we see the ramifications for his actions? Is it because he's \"the legend\" or is it because there wasn't enough time left to tie up loose ends? Or is it possibly because it was dramatized? Or did they explain it?\n\nAnother technical thing. I thought the part in the beginning when he's debating on whether to shoot the kid would have been perfect without the bombastic music. \n\nI also didn't like a bunch of the quick cuts. \n\nThings I liked:\n\nBradley Cooper rocked. He did an amazing job. The acting in this movie was stellar on all accounts. \n\nEastwood, for the exception of a couple of really stupid scenes (when Kyle kills the sniper) did a good job. \n\nI liked that they didn't completely overdue the God, Country, Family thing. That was part of why I had a hard time with the book. He's a patriot, and I respect that, but it got to a point where it was annoying. \n\nThe film was good... not great. Bradley Cooper was great, and he deserves his Oscar nod, but other than that the film shouldn't have been as cooed over as it was. I haven't seen a movie that wowed me since Whiplash. \n", "The best scenes were of him at home dealing with PTSD, and the internal struggle of every veteran.", "Was I the only one who thought the butcher and mustafa were painfully caricaturized villains. I don't think the film needed specific bad guys to begin with but Eastwood turned these guys into bond villains. And bad ones to boot. ", "Enjoyable, although a little unremarkable, war movie with visceral, well-filmed action scenes and a career-defining performance from Bradley Cooper. Unfortunately the film is so fixated on keeping Cooper's character Kyle in its sights that it misses many of the broader areas of moral ambiguity surrounding the war and his actions, as well as completely neglects all the supporting characters, none moreso than Kyle's wife played by Sienna Miller.\n\nThis would be fine if the movie worked primarily as a character study of its protagonist, like The Hurt Locker, which it clearly takes a lot of inspiration from, but the issue is that the brief glimpses we get into Kyle's psyche are generally heavy-handed and cliched (staring at a blank television, really?). Compounding this is the fact that the final moments of the film were clearly designed based on the assumption that the audience knows how the story ends, but for those who don't (which I would think would be the majority of non-American viewers), the ending will feel bizarrely rushed and anti-climactic, and nowhere near as powerful as it could have been if handled in a more traditional way.\n\nThis being said there's a lot to like here, much of it centered around Cooper's take on Kyle and Eastwood's tense, tight, and decidedly unflashy direction. The level of grittiness is just right, the flashes of violence are impactful and gutwrenching, and an overwhelming sense of sadness and bitterness lingers the whole way through the tale, leaving you unsure of whether the movie is pro-military, anti-war, or both.", "I now join the minority who fucking LOVE this film.

Same with Bradley Cooper.  I believe the scene in which he has a child in his sights for the 2nd time and is very relieved to not have to pull the trigger is his \"oscar clip scene.\"\n\nThinking it's only some rah, rah, go Merica film is nonsense. Yea it's from an American perspective and of course the military is portrayed well but Kyle goes through some real intense shit and you can see how it affects him. You can tell he really internalizes a lot of it and it begins to mess with him mentally. It's not a mindless war film that shows the U.S. SEAL going in and kicking ass and then coming home with no issues. It doesn't shy away from the fact that warfare is fucking terrible and innocents die and the soldiers on BOTH sides are the ones responsible.  \n\nI didn't mind the portrayal of Iraqis and terrorist fighters.  Many were portrayed as brutal killers but of course from the actions of ISIS and other groups we know that's not inaccurate.  But they weren't all portrayed that way.  Kyle's main sniper nemesis was shown to have a wife and child just like Kyle.  He wasn't shown to be evil or brutal just a sniper on the other side that was nearly as effective as Kyle was.  I appreciated the the approach that war has these men do terrible things and it affects both sides and it's not just the people who are blown up that carry the scars with them.\n\nIf I had a criticisms of the film it's just that it had a few Hollywood moments that aren't very accurate.  The constant calls with his wife while in firefights were really annoying.  Just pure Hollywood.  \n\nAll this is coming from someone who just generally doesn't like anything Clint Eastwood touches and was gong in with the feeling (like most of Reddit) that the only reasons this was nominated was because it's Oscarbait and every Oscar is very likely Eastwood's last.

Plastic Baby, American Sniper. \n\nYayyyyyy!", "At no point did I feel the character of Chris Kyle was conflicted with what he was doing, apart from a couple of moments in the movie which seemed to be glossed over pretty quickly. There were some moments when I thought there would finally be a meaty discussion about the fact that he was a state-sanctioned mass murderer, but they passed very quickly.\n\nOne in particular stood out - when he was driving home from the funeral in the car and his wife asks him what he thought about the letter. His response was not what I expected (great!) and I was really looking forward to hearing his wife's response to this. We got nothing.\n\nI thought the movie was entertaining but very pedestrian. At no point did I feel like I got to know the hero who had no other faults other than 'caring too much' about his brothers-in-arms.", "I'm probably in the minority, but I was underwhelmed by Clint Eastwood's directing. Does anyone know how much input he had in the production and post-production process?\n\nI felt that the pacing of the film was off from the get go. Scenes ran too long with pointless information (his gf cheating, guy hitting on his future wife, shooting dirt) and killed the momentum that the opening scene created. Oddly enough, Eastwood skipped through this part of the story rather quickly by giving the viewer little meaningful substance to work with.\n\nIn addition, a lot of the cinemtography is cheesy. The woman by the window, the bad sniper jumping buildings, Bradley Cooper ducking headshots, and many others had me rolling my eyes. All the \"bad guys\" are straight out of an 80s movie with their sinister looks, bad aiming, and willfully running towards gunfire.\n\nEastwood also chooses to play out the \"revenge scene\" after the guy gets shot in the face by having the military men crush objects with their vehicle and shoot up some bad guys while music is blasting.\n\nI feel like he had a great story to work with and had difficulty translating and then meshing the action and drama on screen. Many directors before him have been able to do it, but I think he falls short.", "Besides some great direction and really well done action sequences, this movie ultimately fell short for me.\n\nMy main complaint is that there is a much more interesting movie in there somewhere. This guy, Chris Kyle, has something like 200 confirmed kills over 4 years of armed service. He was a high volume killer. I mean, those numbers have to put you in the running for most efficient killer of recent times. And there were times when the movie poked and prodded at these issues. Where he would feel the weight of his actions, or you'd see how unsettled he is when he's at home. But for the most part, the majority of this movie's run time went for the patriotic hero angle, and not the angle that would have been more interesting in my opinion which is coming to terms with the fact that you are basically committing one man genocide.\n\nMy conceptual complaints aside, it's really not a bad movie. Cooper was great in it, and the movie was rarely boring. Some of the sniper scenes were brilliantly tense, reminiscent of the kind of tensity Kathryn Bigelow can get out of similar scenes. The enemies were a bit one dimensional which overall added to my main complaint that there is a more interesting movie in here somewhere, but it was worth a watch.\n\nOverall, I think Clint Eastwood was probably the last person I wanted to see take on this story, even though he is a very capable director. I heard the script was once in Spielberg's hands and a few others, and I'm curious what the movie would have been like in someone else's hands.", "This was definitely a decent movie, but to score so many oscar nods was surprising to say the least. I have read the book, and the parts that stood out to me the most in the book were nowhere in the movie. \n\nChris doesn't even meet Mostafa in the book! He only mentions him, and yet the majority of the conflict while he was on tour centered on their hunt of each other. Hollywood had too heavy of an influence on the film and in my opinion did not stay true to the source material. \n\nNow does that make it a bad film? No. But it certainly takes away from the credibility of the film, something that seriously affected 'Selma' for similar reasons, but was much more heavily penalized than American Sniper. ", "We saw the movie last night, it was the first time in my life I went in to see a movie and felt like I walked out of a funeral.

I noticed the faked baby, and was slightly confused by it but what ever.  I'm positive I'm seeing things a bit differently than most people, but I think that Eastwood and Cooper gave Chris Kyle's children a gift that is worth more than any Oscar bull shit.

Even got our two main beers in the movie. Lonestar and Bud. ", "Fucking great movie. The character development was well laid out with his father's \"Sheep, Wolves, and Sheepdogs\" speech, Chris' complete inability to admit he needed help or admit weakness at any point was incredibly sad, the battle scenes were tense and well shot, and the ending really resonated with me. \n\nI do wish they'd spent more time in the brief stretch of the movie where he came home and was suffering from PTSD and survivors guilt. I think that part said a lot about his character, and when he realized he could still \"save\" people back home, that was powerful. ", "Great movie and well directed and acted.

At one point he actually non-sarcastically says that America is the greatest country on earth. I thought Eastwood was going to start the character out like that and then slowly progress him into someone who realizes the horror of the conflict taking place in the middle east and comes to terms with the fact that there are layers to what is going on and America might in fact be doing some things wrong too.

It's filled with many, MANY, scenes that make you think, but I just think that they could have done much more, or rather, you get the feel that they were overwhelmed with the humanization of MLK and are stuck in this awkward halfway point of showing him and his role in the civil rights movement, and the human cost of the movement, producing a spork of a movie. \n\nI really, REALLY, wanted to like this movie. I suppose my reaction can best be explained by the only other person that saw this movie with my girlfriend and I last night.

The casting of the film was perfection at its finest. The pathos was by far some of the most intense I have felt in a while. \n\nThe most emotional part as a black man is realizing that though we have come far from Selma we still are not done fighting. It is similar to the situation between north and south Korea, there is no official cease-fire, however, both sides have decided to keep the fighting to a minimal. As much as we would like to believe we are equal it is becoming more and more apparent that it is not the case. The black man is still subjugated and demoralized. This time, instead of taking it to the streets and doing it in the open, it is done behind closed doors but not just by the white man, but they have been joined by those who share the ancestry and have bought into this system of perpetual dehumanization. Meanwhile, there are black men in the streets perpetuating the stereotype of the angry black man that Martin Luther King Jr. worked so hard to prevent. \n\nWe are a great race that has nurtured civilization just to have it used against us and yet we still fail to see the potential that we have. What our ancestors did better than anyone else was acquire knowledge and recognize the importance of sharing that knowledge. They worked together as a civilization and tried to make a global coalition of scholars and students alike. Though there were plenty of flaws in their ways they never gave up trying to make it better. Now, we have created an image and culture counter to the advancement of mankind and the creation of equality to the best of our ability. \n\nThis fight has been going on for centuries, lately we have been seeing occurrences of this thanks to social media and activists alike. Yet we still sit idly by. We value money, drugs, and power over education, equality, and unity. We have been blinded by the American dream though it was never intended for us. It is time to wake up, open your eyes, and make a difference. I am not saying to be radical or protest or any of that, however, if you feel so inclined go forth. What I am saying is what many before me have, we must value ourselves enough to not let this crippling system warp our culture to a bastard shell of what it once was. And this is not just for black people, this for everyone. We have to work together to end this fight because there is more on the horizon and we cannot be divided. I Sincerely hope this resonates with at least some of you. Educate yourselves, look at one another as people, not as different colors, love one another as family because when it comes down to it that is what we all are. None of us have the answers, but together, we might find them. \n\nSorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes. \nAlso, go see Selma, it is well worth any amounts of money you spend.

I don't tear up often in movies but 2014 has now given me two films that had me well up during some scenes; Selma is one of them.\n\nDavid Oyelowo truly became MLK in this movie; what a performance. And the dialogue and acting was superb all around save for one - the SNCC leader in conflict with John Lewis; that character was such a one note distraction the entire film imho. \n\nSelma is a quite an achievement in filmmaking if for no other reason than finally having a major motion picture with MLK as the protagonist. It's incredible that this is the first time that's happened and that it was done so damn well.", "I really enjoyed this movie. If it wasn't such a strong year for movies, this would probably be in my top 5 of 2014. But as it is, it's probably #7 or #8.\n\nI do think David Oyelowo does an incredible job. He really brings both the gravity and the humanity of Dr. King. I hope his performance is remembered around Oscar-time.\n\nThe story was engaging, though I saw the movie with some friends and they said that there were too many moments of Dr. King starring off into the distance. That's an interesting critique, personally I don't remember it happening that much. There are some slow scenes that could use some tweaking IMHO, but other than that, the screenplay is always engaging.\n\nI would say that the directing wasn't top notch, but still admirable. Because this is only Ava DuVernay's second movie (and her first big movie) there are a lot of what I would call \"film-school shots\", which are shots primarily used by recent film-school students who haven't yet solidified their directorial style. In the hands of a more experienced director, I think the movie could've had a more distinctive visual style, but as it is right now, it's fine. \n\nI would recommend this movie for anyone that likes American history, admires Dr. King, and likes big ensemble historical dramas. It is definitely one of the best of the year.

It's the same problem I had with Lincoln. Scenes would grind to a halt so someone could slowly talk at length with overly hyperbolic language in a strained \"Important\" voice while music cues told you to get ready to cry. I think it undermined the importance of what was happening by trying to tell us that it was \"Important.\" The filmmakers made them into cheesy hallmark moments. \nI don't mean the church speeches either, those were amazing. The ones that jumped out in particular were the slave ship one between Corretta and the other woman and the car scene between Dr. King and the Selma Youth guy.  ", "I was completely underwhelmed.

The acting was ok, David Oyelowo was impressive as MLK but the script really didn't allow for any of the character to have any real depth. The characters that died, the young black guy and the priest just felt like cannon fodder. They had no real personality so when they were murdered you didn't really feel anything for them. Finally, why is Oprah in this movie? Her character adds nothing apart from being another face to pointlessly focus on during the marches!\n", "Pretty good movie.\n\nOyelowo was great as the late Dr. King, and Tim Roth made a positively loathsome George Wallace. The cinematography was a little odd, breaking the 180 degree rule at times in order to emphasize dramatic moments, which I thought was rather distracting and unnecessary, but other than that I had no complaints except for the song during the end credits, which I found to be distastefully hammy. I think Oyelowo deserves accolades for his performance, but I don't think this should win best picture due to some bizarre choices with its cinematography and what I thought was rather disjointed pacing. \n\n\n\n", "Absolutely incredible movie! I went in without hearing much about it and I was blown away!\n\nI'm Canadian so we don't spend much time in the civil rights movement in school, but it makes my blood boil to see the injustices that black people faced in order to get equal rights. I'm really glad I went to see this movie!", "Loved this movie, riveting to the very end bolstered by a Oscar nominated worthy performance from David Oyelowo. \n\nAva Duvernay also didn't drag anything out, her direction on this film was impeccable. The dialogue scenes as well as the protest scenes were great and the scene depicting the murder of the Four Young Girls rattled me down to the pit of my stomach.\n\nFocusing on one event in Dr. King's life was also a wise move, this is the *Lincoln* of the year for being an historical event well written and well told, also deciding not to deify Dr. King and show some of his cracks and flaws gave a more nuanced portrayal of the ordinary man who accomplished some extraordinary things.  \n\nCarmen Ejogo also deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod for her work as Coretta Scott King, she was probably the emotional center of the movie and she hit it right out of the park. All other actors were serviceable and added to the film.\n\nOverall, great film, deserves to be up their with *Boyhood* a one of the year's best. Definitely check it out if you can! ", "I really enjoyed it. When I watched the opeining with the Birmingham bombing I was worried it would be straight Oscar bait. While it was obviously Oscar-bait, it was a well-made film that deserves to be recognized as one of this year's best. I really loked the narrow focus on Selma for a biopic and I think other biopics should take notice for similar projects. It can be much more interesting to focus on an individual event than a life story. \n\nHowever, I have one major gripe about this film. It simply portrays LBJ wrong. I know a decent amount about the civil rights movement and LBJ was completely off. LBJ fought hard for civil rights his entire career and it felt dishonest to show him against the voting bill and only siding with it to preserve his legacy. LBJ was the politician who got thw fucking bill passed (obviously MLK had a major part in it, but he was not the sole reason). \n\nRealistically (to a point), it would have LBJ taking advantage of events to persuade congressmen on a bill they would not have voted for otherwise. If you want to rid the white savior storyline, then have LBJ tell MLK at the beginning that he doesn't have the votes for the bill, then frame Selma as the reason for the votes changing. IMHO this is the beat balance because LBJ acts in character and it does not minimalize the importance of Selma. The way they did it is just dishonest and is a disservice to LBJ.

Stole every goddamn scene she was in. I really hope Anderson uses her again. \n\nSidenote, [there's a great interview that Anderson did on Marc Maron's podcast](http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_565_-_paul_thomas_anderson) in which he talks about his entire filmography for a solid two hours.

A few facts that will help to make sense of it all.\n \n* the Golden Fang (the organization not the boat) is a criminal organization with covert government backing / ties.  One of the ways we know this because of the boat disappearance/ brainwashing story about the actor (told by Benicio del Toro's character). The brainwashing is the same thing that is happening to Wolfmann at the asylum/ drug rehab center, which is owned by the Golden Fang.  The Government wants to make him their puppet in Las Vegas\n\n* We see both FBI agents and Nazi gang member Puck Beaverton at the rehab, further linking the Golden Fang to the government. \n\n*  Coy Harlington is a government snitch forced to infiltrate counter culture organizations, he cant go home until he is let off the hook by the government.  He is allowed to go home because Doc takes Coy's freedom as payment by the Golden Fang for the return of the drugs.  Again establishing that the Fang is the Government.\n\n* Shasta sends Doc to the Fang headquarter/ Dentist office  while she is trapped on the Boat.  She does this by referencing the ouija board day in her post card.  She was likely held on the boat while Wolfmann was being reprogrammed.  She is released once he is fully reprogrammed and she can be of no influence.\n\n* the dentist office is just more of the Golden Fangs vertical integration. Sell the drugs, make money of the junkies teeth, make money off rehab.  Sell them more drugs and repeat process.\n  \n* Bigfoot is a repressed Hippie who used to work the beach before becoming a detective.  He actually likes Doc in a fucked up sort of way.  Eating the pot is a sign of letting his repression out.  Bigfoot is one of the good guys.  He treats Doc like shit the same way a big brother picks on a little brother or immature boys tease a girl they like.\n\n* The good guys in this movie do drugs but don't still do Heroin.  Penny the DA smokes pot, Bigfoot eats weed, both the Coy's kicked Heroin, and even Clancey Charlock takes a hit of Gas from Doc.\n\n* Bigfoot hates the Golden Fang and the Feds because he knows they are responsible for the death of his partner.  The only way he can get back at them is by not helping the Feds and busting the Golden Fang.\n\n* I would pay $14 to see two hot women eat each other's pussies.\n   \n            ", "I am still laughing when I remember the scene Joaquin Phoenix screamed when seeing the photograph.

The haziness and toying with worthlessness is much more prevalent here than in The Master, though.\n\nAnother thing: I've never had a stronger urge to read the book the film is based on than after watching Inherent Vice. Initially, it's because I want to see if Pynchon is as random and confusing in his flow of events as Anderson, but mostly it's to study how Anderson adapted the work for the screen. Pynchon is an infamously \"tough\" read, with most of his novels unmanageable in any other medium, but it looks like Anderson has found a way to do it. \n\nThe performances, the music, the lighting: all top, top notch as is to be expected, but the story is still making my head spin. \n\nThe two scenes where the whole film came together for me and made sense was when Bigfoot eats all the weed and a naked Shasta talks to Doc on his couch right before they have sex. That is, most of what occurs and is said may just as well be Doc's own half baked mind projecting it.

Instead of car chases, paranoid conversations about the Wizard of Oz, and Doc falling asleep during stakeouts, two people would sit in a room and talk and then there'd be another scene with two people talking and so on and so forth.\nPhotography bothered me to the extreme. The closeness got under my skin pretty bad. Even if that's the point (and I doubt it was), it's a lot more fun to watch people interacting with each other at the same time. The last shot, I wouldn't have known what was happening if I hadn't read the book, due to how tight it was. \n\nThe editing just didn't gel in this movie. There was little sense of rhythm or flow. Scenes started, ended, transitioned, and that was it.\n\nWhat physical comedy was there was nice, but there wasn't enough to begin with.

I mean, Pynchon didn't tackle his subject matter lightly, but it felt like he was willing to have some fun with what he was doing (Denis and his pizza from hell, for instance). PTA's movie, however, was so down-to-earth that it was kind of a slog, which was a shame.\n\nThere were many things that I liked about the movie.

It wasn't really meant to, and it didn't in the book either. She was there more as a device to get Doc involved in the story.\n\nI was talking with the theater staff after the movie and they were theorizing that it's possible that Shasta didn't exist either, which is a fascinating take on it.", "I enjoyed this way more than the Master.

After that you just sort of sit and relax and go with it.

Oddly enough Bigfoot was the only guy that was always around when Doc needed someone to rely on.\n\nI saw it in a full theater and after about thirty minutes everyone was just chuckling to themselves constantly. There was never a single huge laugh out loud moment though, it's just charming at times. Shouldn't really be sold as a comedy.\n\nI didn't love it to death, but it can't be called bad in any aspect.

She's like Doc's friend but not at first? And the other girl who I assume is the narrator, we don't know much about her. There were so many others and this made me feel like the film lacked focus. \n\nAlso I'm unsure as to why Doc felt motivated to free Owen Wilson's character? Was it just out of the goodness of his heart? Or a job since his wife talked to Doc? I was just confused about that part. \n\nI don't know what PTA's intentions were with this movie.

Not only were many characters thrown in without explanation, but they were also super underdeveloped to the point where the only character I even cared about was Doc (and barely at that). And maybe I missed something, but I was even underwhelmed with Elswitt's cinematography. It all went downhill for me after that first shot. \n\nAs many have said before me, I thought the plot was extremely hard to follow in terms of names and people.

I was genuinely interested in each and every scene. \n\nThe trend I've noticed from all of the reviews I've been reading is this: People who have read Pynchon's novel are enjoying the film more. (Obviously there are exceptions to this) It seems that coming into the film with a previous knowledge of the characters and story made it easier to like. \n\nOther thoughts:\n\n* Loved the Sexy Shasta scene (you know which one)\n* Didn't like Maya Rudolph. It just felt like a gotta-put-my-wife-in-my-film-one-of-these-days kind of thing\n* Music was fun\n* (SPOILERS!) I haven't seen anybody talking about this anywhere and I'm dying to know. Was the last shot an homage/throwback/rip-off/whatever to Taxi Driver? He did the whole double take in the mirror thing and then it ended. PTA already borrowed from Scorsese with the ending of Boogie Nights so it wouldn't be that much of a stretch. \n\nFinal thoughts: I am a huge PTA fan so it would be silly to think I'm trolling or \"just hating to hate\".

Here's my full review for anyone who fancies reading it: http://movie-crawler.com/2015/01/09/taken-3-review-12/\n\n- The opening 20 minutes is just boring, unnecessary \"character development\", but honestly, does anyone give a fuck about these characters enough to see Neeson buying a giant teddy bear for his daughter and bagels?\n\n- The PG-13/12A rating is a huge problem again. When Neeson's wife dies (not a spoiler, it's in the trailer), she has her throat slit but there's no blood. If you know you're making a PG13 movie, why the FUCK would you have her die so violently? It's incredibly jarring when she could've been stabbed/shot in the chest and then the facial shots wouldn't look so silly. This is a big problem overall, though. The editing has to obscure all the violence to keep it bloodless, and as a result it just looks fucking stupid like it did in the last movie. I believe it also had additional edits to secure a 12A in the UK instead of a 15 rating.\n\n- The dialogue and acting are absolutely terrible. It's written like a computer just picked the phrase out of a dialogue tree. Nothing sound natural at all and the performances are all totally phoned in, unsurprising because everyone knows this is just a payday. Dougray Scott barely seems awake in some scenes, and the dubious highlight is Forest Whitaker as an eccentric cop with a weird bagel fetish.\n\n- There's not much action. 2 set pieces in the first half, a couple in the end. The only cool moment in the whole movie is when the car skids into the plane at the end, but the trailers ruined this.\n\n- The editing. HOLY SHIT, this is easily the worst thing about the whole movie. The brief spurts of action are cut up so heavily it's hard to make spatial sense of anything that's going on. It's particularly bad during the fistfights and car chases; I'm talking 5-6 cuts per second. It's so incredibly jarring and distracted me in pretty much every action scene. AWFUL.\n\n- Way too much CGI. They throw in some really ridiculous digital stunts but the whole Loony Tunes action doesn't really work when the tone is so self-serious and funereal throughout. Plus they even use CGI for loads of the car crashes which just looks stupid.\n109 minutes is WAY too long. I was ready for it to end by the hour mark. Jesus.\n\nIf this levels out at above 10% on RT I will be amazed. I hope it bombs, but it's unlikely.", "Do they even use the title \"Inspector\" in the US?

What need did he have for her at this point? Surely she was only dead weight at that point... and a reason for Neeson to come after him. He should have just shot her in the leg or something, then Neeson would have been more concerned with that then following him.\n\nAlso, why did he want Neeson to kill the Russian? As soon as his wife died he had her insurance money, so he could have just paid him off? I suppose he might have just wanted to keep it all for himself - but seems like a massive gamble to pit them off against each other no?\n\nI realise it's a bit daft to look for logic in a Taken film, but these two points bugged me. You know, apart from the terrible dialogue and the whole thing generally being a a very poor man's Bourne.", "Wow, wasn't expecting this terrible of a response.

I found myself hoping he would actually fail so they would just shoot him and the movie would be over. There was no reason behind what he does! All he does is get money and gamble it all away.\nThe scenes where Wahlberg is teaching literature were a few of the most cringe worthy scenes in recent memory. None of it seemed like real life. The dialogue just took me so far out of the movie that I saw myself with my head in my hands just waiting for it to be over. They expect you to care about the relationship between Wahlberg and Larson, when they are only really on screen together for ten minutes of the film. She makes it seem like the only way to score a hot girl these days is to complain about how much your life sucks. I guess John Goodman and Michael K Williams characters were decent, but they seemed more content on giving Wahlberg life lessons than being actual gangsters. I really liked the dynamic between him and his mother, though, she again was not on screen for very long either, and their relationship was left on a sour note. I really wanted to see Wahlberg repair this relationship at least some how, which just adds onto the list of why you just can not like his character at all.\nAll in all, it was hard to keep my head out of my hands while sitting in the theater.
